98 per cent of the respondents think that black money exists in India.

99 per cent of the respondents think the evil of corruption needs to be fought and eliminated.

90 per cent of the respondents think the Central government's move to tackle black money is brilliant!



These are some of the key outputs of prime minster Narendra Modi's demonetisation survey conducted through his mobile phone application NaMo. Sharing the results on Twitter, PM Modi thanked the people of India for HISTORIC participation and that it is satisfying to read the insightful views and comments.

I thank people for the historic participation in the survey. Its satisfying to read the insightful views &amp; comments. https://t.co/xf14LEiQHTpic.twitter.com/cGSBPlCnE5 â€” Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 23, 2016



Meanwhile, people also say PM Modi's demonetisation survey on NaMo app has no room for dissent





Here are the survey results:

ON BLACK MONEY:

98 per cent of respondents agree that black money exists in India and 99 percent think that the evil of corruption and black money needs to be fought and eliminated.

ON MODIJI'S AND THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS

Applauding PM Modi and his government's efforts, 90 per cent of the respondents have approved the government's move to tackle black money. Slightly above this mark, 92 per cent of the respondents think that Modi government's efforts against corruption are very good.



ON INCONVENIENCE FACED

Divided over the matter of inconvenience caused, 43 per cent did not mind the inconvenience faced in the fight to curb corruption, black money, terrorism and counterfeiting of currency. 48 per cent, on the other hand, find that the inconvenience was worth it. A mere 8 per cent have agreed that they have faced inconvenience.



ON (OTHER) ANTI-CORRUPTION CRUSADERS

86 per cent believe that some anti-corruption activists are now actually fighting the cause of black money, corruption and terrorism.





Here are all the results in one place, what PM Modi calls as JAN JAN KI BAAT:

It has been 14 days since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surgical attack on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes turned the country’s largely cash-based economy upside down, leaving the public queuing up at ATMs and banks. And now he is seeking a feedback.

On Tuesday, the PM asked people to log onto his app (NARENDRA MODI APP) to take a survey of 10 questions. The tech- savvy PM tweeted, ""I want your first-hand view on the decision taken regarding currency notes. Take part in the survey on the NMApp.

One of the questions in the survey on the App

The survey uses some nifty reverse psychology. It begins with some innocuous queries phrased like a catechism (religious questionnaires in which there is only one answer). Take the first question: “Do you think black money exists in India?” And then, the second: “Do you think the evil of corruption and black money needs to be fought and eliminated?”

The two answers given are ‘yes’ and ‘no’. No prizes for guessing which way the responses will go.

The survey comes to the crux in the latter half of the test, which includes questions like, “Do you think demonetisation will bring real estate, higher education, healthcare in common man’s reach?, to which the respondents have to either ‘completely agree’ or ‘partially agree’ or ‘can't say’. There is no ‘disagree’ option.

The ninth question is even more leading and pre-loaded: “Do you believe some anti-corruption activists are now actually fighting in support of black money, corruption and terrorism?” Now, what do you say to that if you have spent every day in the past 14 days standing in a line at the ATM and living off your loose change? The respondent gets the feeling that anybody with an opposing view would be seen as pro-corruption, pro-black money, pro-terrorism and eventually, an anti-national.

It’s clear what sort of findings are likely to come from this survey. But a fuller questionnaire might have brought home to the Prime Minister a clearer picture of the situation on the ground.

Here are some questions Narendra Modi’s survey does not ask:

Do you have any money with you now? How long have you had to stand in the queues before you could withdraw/exchange some of your money? Are the ATMs/ banks in your locality being steadily supplied with cash? Did you have to forego any potential opportunity pertaining to career/personal life due to the currency shortage? Do you think the move should have been implemented in a phased manner? Has the move disrupted your regular routine? Has the move caused any inconvenience to you or anybody that you know? Whom do you think the move has affected the most in the hierarchal ladder of India’s economy? The rich, the middle class or the poor? Are you finding it difficult to use the new currency of Rs 2,000 in the market?

And here are the questions that PM Modi did ask:

The app, hosted on Google Play store, automatically gets excessive permission including full network access and ability to take pictures and videos once downloaded.

A “Narendra Modi” app, purportedly offered by the Government of India, caught the attention of Internet expert Pranesh Prakash on Thursday as the app developer was found to be using a Bangladesh-based web host and e-mail address. Suggesting that this could be the work of a con-artist, Prakash underlined that granting access to fake apps could lead to security breach. The app, hosted on Google Play store, automatically gets excessive permission including full network access and ability to take pictures and videos once downloaded. The original NaMo, however, only gets access to read, modify and delete the user’s media files. The “fake” app was downloaded more than 1 lakh times and has an average rating of 4.4 from over 2,000 reviews. A simple search on the play store throws up dozens of Narendra Modi apps, some even calling themselves fake apps. The original app was published by Narendramodi.in and Government Of India. But there are scores of other apps trying to imitate the original.

There are two @NamoApp on the Google Play store, and both ask for details that the police couldn’t get without a court warrant. No \#security pic.twitter.com/SgFF0hLanf — Pranesh Prakash (@pranesh) December 2, 2016

Pranesh, who is Policy Director at The Centre for Internet and Society, also questioned how users can differentiate between fake and genuine apps when even the official app was registered using a gmail address. While the Government of India Narendra Modi app has been published using info@narendramodi.press, the one by Narendramodi.in has been published using a simple Gmail app. He also highlighted how the play store was flooded with fake banking apps, with one such “SBI app” gaining full access to the user’s files. Incidentally, the fake Modi Ki Note app which has been in the limelight since the demonetisation on high value notes and issue of new ones itself has many duplicates.

In the last two days, the Congress and its vice-president Rahul Gandhi fell victim to hacking as their verified Twitter accounts were compromised. Profane content was shared from both accounts, targeting the Gandhi and his family. This lead to the Congress questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s digital India push as security remains a huge concern.

The financial year will be shifted to January- December instead of April-March. An announcement to this effect may be made on 30th December as a new year gift from the NaMo administration to black marketeers and their political terrorists’ patrons.

There is a strong possibility that from 1st April 2017, only two taxes – Direct Tax as BTT and  Indirect Tax as GST – may be found on the statute book.
The NaMo administration is said to have calculated that the demonetization of Rs.500 and Rs.1000, along with the printing of new Rs 500 and 200 notes, would suck up Rs.1,42,0000 crores out of the market. This is said to dismantle the cash economy. Further actions in this regard would be taken by not allowing any cash transaction above Rs.10,000 without PAN or Aadhar.

At tandem, all salaries and business expenses would be required to be made in cheque or RTGS only to claim expenses in Income Tax. All cash transactions may be disallowed.This would be coupled with a Cash Limitation order that will allow the maximum cash allowance of Rs.50,000 per person.

As the cash economy is destroyed after a few months, the Rs.2,000 note will be demonetised with a limited notice. This will strangle the cash economy to death as there would be limited cash available in the market.
As some participants of the cash economy may try to shift to Gold, Gold coins manufacturing and imports will be banned.

A Gold and Precious Jewellery control order may be issued which will allow only 500 gram of Gold per person and a certain value of other jewelry. Relaxation will be given for existing jewelry if declared to authorities as per format. After a certain date, all undeclared Gold and jewelry will be liable to be taken over by the state.

A Property and Asset Declaration order will be issued where all property (Land, Buildings, and Flats) and shares will have to be declared to the authorities in a particular format. After a certain date, all undeclared property or shares will be liable to be taken over by the state.

New Delhi: The government has been scrambling since the demonetisation drive began on 9 November to stay a step ahead of black money hoarders. It has had to constantly rewrite the rules to do this, inviting flak for the constant changes in regulations.

From changing the rules governing exchange of currency at banks and post offices as well as on the usage of old Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes in different places to tightening the reporting requirements by banks on cash deposits to proposing changes in tax laws to make it more attractive for tax evaders to voluntarily declare their undisclosed income rather than trying to legalize it through illegal means, the government has been on its toes trying to outmanoeuvre the tax evaders.

“The government has had to roll back some of the measures it had announced. But all the steps that were taken were aimed at countering the misuse of some of the measures that were announced. For instance, in exchange of currency notes, we were seeing large scale misuse,” said a senior tax department official, who did not wish to be identified. He was referring to the government’s decision to stop exchange of currency notes at bank counters with effect from 24 November despite initially promising to continue it longer.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced late on 8 November that old Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes would cease being legal tender from 9 November. The move, he argued, would help in curbing black money, counterfeit currency and terror financing. People were given time to deposit the currency in their bank accounts by 30 December.

A month since, fears are growing that demonetisation may have limited impact for several reasons, including the innovativeness of tax evaders. The fact that with still three weeks to go for people to deposit the old currency, more than Rs11.55 trillion of the estimated Rs16 trillion of such notes in circulation has been deposited in banks has added to the worries of the government.

The income tax department has received intelligence that tax evaders are using several methods to legalize their black money. The modus operandi varies.

From colluding with jewellers for buying gold jewellery with back-dated bills, to using money launderers to convert the old notes into new for a small fee, even incentivizing the poor to deposit the money into their Jan Dhan (no frills) bank accounts for a small commission, tax evaders are surprising the taxmen with their ingenuity.

As the tax department and the central bank step up their monitoring of suspicious transactions, instances of bankers colluding with tax evaders to launder black money are also coming to light.

Though constrained by the lack of personnel, the income tax department is aggressively using technology to keep track of suspicious transactions. It has conducted many search operations on jewellers and known money launderers, looking for irregularities. Banks have made reporting requirements more stringent to ensure all large deposits are reported to the tax department.

The surge in the deposits prompted the government to introduce a legislation in Parliament last week encouraging tax evaders to voluntarily come forward and declare their unaccounted income and escape with a tax and penalty amounting to 50% of undeclared income rather than using conduits to legalize their wealth. The legislation, which is awaiting Parliament’s nod, also proposed to increase taxes and penalties for those who do not opt to make the disclosure. Tax and penalty in these cases could amount to more than 80% of the undeclared income.

“The presumption was that around 10-15% of the currency will not come back and there will be windfall gains. But now it seems there has been a miscalculation on the part of the government and there will be virtually no demonetisation.

The income tax department is left with little choice but to comb through the deposits and look for black money for the next two to three years. But it is constrained by its limited manpower,” said M. C. Joshi, former chairman of the central board of direct taxes.

69,"&gt; If demonitization fails

Incorrect. It's not a question of if it fails. It has already happened. There are no benefits and massive pain.

&gt; If the BJP will lose badly in 2019 

Will never happen. Even with the evident demonetisation failure, the next election is a long 2.5 years away. People mostly vote on the last year or maybe even half year. By 2018, these effects will be gone. Modi's natural political talent will supersede any attempt by the feckless opposition to mount a counter-attack. 

The fundamental problem for the opposition has not changed. They have not a single person who is even remotely as skilled as Modi. Namo understands that politics is 99% optics. Nobody knows the details of demonetisation. If it fails he can just spin it as the evil black money masters doing their evil work. People should be patient as the struggle is long. People will lap it up.

&gt; we can look forward to increasingly aggressive 'nationalism,' bhaktification, and gradual silencing of all dissent.

That will depends on the margin of victory in 2019. I expect it to come down. The BJP may also need to more heavily use coalitions and either expand the NDA or do tactical voting with neutral parties. That would put a natural dampener on the crazies.",2016-12-09 01:51:38

73,"I actually think Modi is doing a good job. 

About demonetization itself I think the benefits (that I already see the roots of) outweigh the cons. I maybe biased in this diagnosis as [disclaimer] I could possibly stand to gain from the cashless transactions push (I work in fintech)...

But then on one side I see jokers like Trump on America, Buffoons like Park Geun-Hye (impeached today) of South Korea, Cheats like Dilma Rousseff (also impeached) - Brazil. 

Now I compare to the *seemingly* good leaders - Obama, Putin (debatable, but I consider him to very much be one), Shinzo Abe, Angela Merkel etc. And I definitely think Modi to be able to stand amongst them rather than the previous sorry lot nor the big camp that doesn't really do much (I consider these guy to be just as bad as camp A).

The effects of demonetisation, we won't even know all of it by 2019. But how I feel is, I'd rather have a ballsy leader that atleast tries to do something rather than sits on his ass with one hand up his butt and the other down his/her throat.

Even if we do fail badly in this, there are still many good side effects from actually undertaking such an experiment. And yes saying, we as a country are too big to fail would be really stupid. Yet, I find there are already multiple checks being put in place to improve the situation and cushion the longer term problems. And as a country, we are really patient. Is that a good thing? How would I know.. Yet, I find I approve his style.

I may or may not agree with modinomics. But I can only agree with the fact that atleast he did try to bring in some serious changes instead of burying his head in the sand like MMS did.

And what are our other options? Pappu, Kejriwal, Mulayam, Mamata, ~~Jayalalitha~~(RIP). Better amongst these evils at the very least, for now.

Its a lot harder for the 1% like me (wow that feels so odd...) to understand the plight of the common man. I don't have a wife or kids to take care of. I can buy stuff I want from Amazon Now, get free food from office, buy everything else I require from the SuperMarket on saturday/Sunday, and buy coupons / use Sodexo etc from the local Kirana for daily stuff like Milk, biscuits etc. I can't claim to understand the struggle of the common man. So, I won't. I find that my life isn't that much impacted. I can do most of my stuff just fine. Just that I have to plan out things a bit better, which IMHO is a really good thing.

Plus I have to admit, NaMo is a marketting genius. He knows perfectly how to sell his idea. Charismatic, and makes perfect use of buzz words, exaggerated promises and his own style and flair that makes you want to jump on his hype train. Compare this to MMS (who probably wasn't corrupt, but did close to nothing) and spoke to the public like once a year or something, maybe during Independance day / republic day. I mean, Modi said something like ""May the force be with you"" or something like that in Times Square (I may be off, but thats what I heard). Thats bloody brilliant.",2016-12-10 04:07:05

Now, comes demonetization. I was skeptical on this from the day one. But what the hell, old notes will be exchanged and new notes will come. Big deal. Modi will get some credit for doing something about it. But even after 30 days, still, no respite for common people and 2 paisa netas are having 20Lacs in new notes. The dangerous unpreparedness and short-sighting before tinkering with already weak economy is really criminal in my view.

The good things it has done to me is that it has opened a can of worms, and has shown that the culprits are within the system - eg, the entire cartel for laundering seems to be comprised of bank officers etc. And we have an ineffective opposition who seem to be going crazy everyday.
