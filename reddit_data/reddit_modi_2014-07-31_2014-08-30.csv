Was Mayaben a member of a known terror organization such as black panthers or AlQaeda? She is a public figure, was there anything in her record that suggested violence? My argument is not that its impossible for a woman to be violent, it is that there was nothing in Mayaben's background that suggested that she was even capable of organizing or leading a murderous mob.

Our pressure instead should be focused on making the govt streamlining the judiciary, making it more efficient and rape cases to be handled separately, considering the amount of rapes nowadays, so that guilty are punished quickly and it sends a message that one cannot get away with it.

It might seem an important issue to you, as you have to put in more work on behalf of your lazy colleague, but the CEO's time isn't worth the minor issue.

It has also been reported that Modi works for 18 hours a day, so he's not obviously wasting his time instead of holding press meets to speak to the nation over rapes and violence.

So I'd say he doesn't have to issue statements over minor issues (in the grand scheme of things). Its not a U-turn because he didn't promise he'll speak out over every issue. And its definitely not ""idiotic"" to not address the nation over every issue ""we consider important"".

22,"Okay, since I know you aren't a troll, I'll give it a shot.

1. He has been elected to govern the country. While I agree that communication of vision is an essential aspect of leadership, this communication does not need to be in the form of a speech or press release. As an example, consider that any policy pronouncement made by a minister (e.g. the Budget) is a form of communication of vision. 

2. If he decides to address the nation on any given issue, then regardless of the content of his speech, nearly half the electorate will cheer for him and a substantial portion of the remaining half will curse him for it. The speech itself will not serve to change anyone's perceptions, and the only people gaining from it will be the media.

3. It can be argued that the vision of the government has already been communicated in the manifesto of the BJP, as well as the speeches given by Mr. Modi during his election campaign. Logically it follows that Mr. Modi now needs to implement that vision instead of harping on it in public speeches. My personal opinion is that he should keep his head down and implement! After all, grand visions are dime a dozen. It is implementation that differentiates great leadership from hot air.

**TL;DR**: Leadership can be distilled down to two aspects (gross simplification) - communicating a vision, and then implementing it. Modi has already done the former during the campaign; it is now time for the latter.

“After months of subdued activity, the Modi wave has struck the service sector and lifted growth to a 17-month  high. New business flows and stronger business sentiment supported the rise. Some of this is simply pent up demand being unleashed. As we move along, faster reforms due to political stability should fuel the momentum. Be sure to expect some bumps along the way, as tensions in the Middle East and the absence of monsoon clouds play spoil sport.""*

69,"August 1, the mothers of Baramulla will heave a sigh of relief as their children can now stop going to Srinagar and elsewhere for higher secondary studies. Behind the local Kendriya Vidyalaya starting classes for Std XI and XII students is a tale of quick, decisive action by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Of late Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being accused of not saying much in public, with some critics even calling him “mauni baba”. But the people of Uri town, 18 km from Baramulla on the river Jhelum, are not complaining. They think Modi’s actions speak louder than anything he can say.

Prime Minister Modi’s work resounds here as for the first the time, a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Baramulla district will start classes for standard 11 and 12 students.

And it’s PM Modi’s unique style of governance that Power Minister Piyush Goel is raving about.  

On July 4, around 11.30 am he landed at the helipad in Baramulla district of Kashmir valley, where Modi was to arrive shortly to inaugurate the 240-Megawatt Uri-II hydro electric project. Meanwhile, the young and energetic Goel started talking to a few locals, among them women. They complained to Goel that their children went to a hostel in Srinagar from class seven or eight onwards as the district didn’t have any Kendriya Vidyalaya for standard 11 and 12 students. The mothers of Baramulla found it very worrisome to send away their teenage kids to Srinagar, which is almost a three-hour drive. The local school, which only has up to standard 10, is funded by a power PSU.

On learning this Goel, image, left,  immediately called up Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on her mobile phone and proposed that his ministry will pick up the expenses if Irani can permit the addition of two more standards in the current Kendriya Vidyalaya in Baramulla.  

Smriti told him, “Give me five minutes,” as the HRD secretary was in a meeting with the Cabinet Secretary in New Delhi just then.

Within an hour or so Smriti Irani called back Goel and said that her department will make all the arrangements and the school can start immediately once Modi gave the go-ahead.

Modi arrived at the helipad in Baramulla at 3.30 pm. Goel told him about the concerns of the mothers of the area and requested the PM, “If you approve, then we can start the school for 11 and 12 standards.”  

Modi asked his staff to make a few calls to New Delhi and talked to some senior officials about the standard operating procedure in such cases. He set the ball rolling and by 4.15 pm Modi himself announced in Uri that the local Kendriya Vidyalaya will start admitting students to standards XI and XII from this year on.

Goel could not believe that Modi will act so fast and that things will change for the children and mothers of Baramulla so quickly. The admission process started a week after Modi left the town.

On August 1, Friday, for the first time ever, standard 11 and 12 classes will be conducted in Baramulla. So far 11 children have taken admission for the new academic year but once the school starts functioning, it is expected that many more students will return from Srinagar and other places where they are currently studying.",2014-07-31 20:00:56

He/she only wants to get there for least amount of money.

Government also needs to encourage small 15-30 seater aircraft operators to fly out of these airport. 

Ah, I could go on and on, I am very passionate about making air travel more accessible. So many Indians travel by trains everyday, there is a HUGE potential for growth in air travel if we could find ways to cut the unnecessary costs involved in flying.

He also admits that in February 2014, he called on Narendra Modi, then the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, and that among the things he told him was how, during the UPA years, several SAARC neighbours had been neglected and several of them not visited by the prime minister. The conclusion that the 83-year old foreign office veteran has is that Manmohan, in fact, never had a foreign policy.

&gt;In his book, he claims that on May 7 this year, a “hesitant” Priyanka Gandhi — “attractive” and dressed in “feminine mufti” — met him at his residence to ask him if he would write about the events in the run-up to the 2004 sweaing-in of the government.

IN A country full of both ambition and frustration, Reliance Industries is a “role model for all Indians who dare to dream,” says its boss, Mukesh Ambani. The company certainly has much to boast of. It is hugely profitable, earning more than any other private Indian firm. It is brave, going where others fear to tread, constructing refineries, drilling for oil and gas, building supermarkets and broadband networks. It invests more in India and pays more corporation tax there than any other firm. Without Reliance, which generates 15% of the country’s exports, the balance of payments would be a wreck.

Yet in other ways, Reliance is a rotten role model for corporate India. When it comes to governance this secretive and politically powerful private empire is not a national champion but an embarrassment.

Reliance’s culture reflects its roots. In the days before India liberalised its economy in 1991, the firm’s founder, Dhirubhai Ambani, fought his way up from a menial job in Yemen through Mumbai’s heaving tenements to the top of Indian business. Socialist dogma and meddling officials were his foes, charm and cunning his tools. He managed to run rings around the country’s stifling rules. Dhirubhai’s tactics appalled India’s establishment. But he marshalled resources to create industrial facilities of the kind every economy needs, including one of the world’s biggest refineries in Gujarat, his birthplace.

India is a more open place now and Mukesh Ambani—the country’s richest man, worth $23.5 billion—is a more cosmopolitan figure than his father. He studied in America, funds think-tanks and was a director of a Wall Street bank. Yet he has maintained two family traditions. One, making big bets on India, is welcome. Reliance is in the midst of a $30 billion investment plan. Dhirubhai’s other legacy, poor governance, is not.

Reliance is a patriarchy with a lightweight board (see article). Although a listed firm, it makes payments equivalent to a quarter of its pre-tax profits to related entities, mainly privately held by the Ambani family. Its ultimate ownership and beneficiaries are obscured by a mesh of holding vehicles that India’s securities regulator says it does not fully understand. The regulator accuses the firm of making illegal gains from trading derivatives linked to its own subsidiary’s shares (an accusation Reliance is contesting). Some foreign investors, put off by the lack of transparency, shy away.

Reliance’s relationship with the government is even more troubling. Anti-corruption campaigners claim Mr Ambani is the power behind the throne of India’s political leaders. Politicians, officials and regulators say Reliance has unusual clout. Reliance denies these claims. Meanwhile, the national auditor is investigating a telecoms-spectrum auction the firm won.

In 2010 it seemed that Reliance might be changing. Mr Ambani bid for LyondellBasell, a global chemicals giant. The deal would have both made Reliance a killing and forced it to modernise its governance, but it fell through. Since then the company’s culture has become even more personalised. In June Mr Ambani’s wife joined the board. In July Reliance took control of a big broadcaster, which will provide Mr Ambani with a platform for his views, should he choose to use it that way.

Mr Ambani seems to believe that Reliance does not need to reform. He is wrong, for two reasons. First, India’s economy is opening up, and the firms most exposed to global competition—tech giants, for instance—have the world-class governance and open cultures needed to command the trust of counterparties, investors and clients, to attract talent and to foster innovation. Asia’s best multinationals, such as Samsung and Lenovo, have had to make painful reforms to stay competitive. Reliance operates in the more opaque parts of the economy, such as infrastructure, that are trapped in a time warp of barons and scandals. But to revive India’s growth rate, Narendra Modi, the new prime minister, will probably expose these sectors to a blast of competition and investment from abroad. The more open the economy, the more of a liability Reliance’s opacity and bad reputation will become.

Second, Indian society is turning against its tycoons. Independent institutions such as the Supreme Court, the national auditor and the central bank are on the warpath against crony capitalism. The electorate is incensed by corruption. Mr Modi may be beholden to the businessmen who bankrolled him, but the voters want him to tackle cronyism. In this climate, Reliance’s power makes it vulnerable. Already, officials are raising awkward questions about its gasfields. Whereas Dhirubhai Ambani was mobbed by adoring crowds, Mukesh, protected by gunmen, is criticised on Twitter. Pervasive mistrust is dangerous for any firm. In the early 20th century Americans demanded that big businesses such as Standard Oil be broken up; today, Mexico’s richest man, Carlos Slim, is under pressure to shrink his empire.

Taking the plunge

There is plenty that Mr Ambani could do to reform his firm. He could adopt global accounting rules, reveal and simplify its ownership and appoint as directors global heavyweights with reputations to lose who can subject Reliance to scrutiny. The company’s shares—like those of many Asian firms—could be listed in America, which has the world’s toughest disclosure regime. To avoid conflicts of interest Mr Ambani could merge his private businesses into Reliance, on terms that are fair to minority shareholders. He could publish details of Reliance executives’ meetings with politicians and officials. He could sell its media assets. He would lose something in personal and political power but gain more through the opportunity to build a more global and more admired business.

There is a contradiction at the heart of Reliance. The firm purports to represent the new India—less deferential, better educated, less corrupt and powered by technology—but runs itself according to the old rules of opacity, hereditary power and political influence. If Mr Ambani is to become the great business leader he wants to be, he needs to let Reliance’s progressive side overpower its darker one",2014-08-01 17:47:26

For being given a ticket in state/municipality elections, BJP and Congress typically demand 10-20 crores from a candidate. Candidates give Rs. 3000-5000 per person to poor people in return of a promise of a vote. Free liquor is distributed by all parties during elections.

&gt;Jeet, instead of boarding a train to Gorakhpur, boarded one going to Ahmedabad.

&gt;There he met a woman who took him to meet Modi, who had not then become the chief minister. Jeet's life changed from there on.

&gt;Meanwhile, Jeet's family had lost hope of ever reuniting with him. But their wish was fulfilled in 2011 when a Nepalese businessmen, Vinod Chaudhary, visited Ahmedabad to attend a FICCI function.

&gt;Modi, who was chief minister of Gujarat then, also came to the function. When Chaudhary invited him to visit Nepal, Modi said he would definitely visit the country if the businessmen could manage to obtain information about his godson's family.

&gt;Chaudhary got back with all the information in 30 hours.

&gt;As a result, Jeet finally visited home in 2011 after a long hiatus, carrying a photograph of him shaking hands with Modi.

The year is 2019. As predicted by several scholars, the information that trickled into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the form of DVDs started to crack the immaculate image of prosperity perpetuated by the North Korean government. The youth in the country grew more and more restless as they saw South Korean TV series about poverty whose protagonists were more affluent than themselves. Images of the Korean peninsula from the sky became more and more popular in the country, with even military outposts sharing them clandestinely with their soldiers. The image shows a dark North Korea, with a faint glow in Pyongyang, and the entire south of the peninsula awash in the light of a heavily successful democracy.

No matter how hardly monitored, the select few in Kim Il-sung University who had access to the internet printed out images of the rest of the world's relative prosperity, with images of even Sudanese cities' modernity rivaling the decadence and decline of even the showcase capital of North Korea, Pyongyang. The military, thus far the backbone of the country's continued existence, also started weaning in its trust of the country's leadership. Criticism of the dictator Kim Jong-un was not reported at all, a far cry from the past when a slight allusion to his weight would be equivalent to signing a death sentence.

Since unification is a legendary dream of all Koreans, inter-Korean engagement on a government level has always been high. In 2016, the North Korean Government commissioned a Rushmore-esque carving of a monument out of stone in Mount Paekdu, the mythological birthplace of the Korean race. The Korean rock, as foreign journalists who visited the monument called it, symbolized a desire for eventual reunification, but as the aforementioned students found out, this was but a lie that was propagated by the government as a part of a plethora of misinformation as a part of programming the North Korean public to be submissive to the elite.

Park Geun-hye visited the country in 2017 as a part of a historical summit that negotiated a ""trade, not aid"" economic program between the two Koreas. In her negotiations with the young Kim Jong-un, she presented him with a miniature stone carving of the Korean unification rock. Kim Jong-un was very impressed with the gift and ordered a redesign of the National Gift Museum, that showcased the gifts given to North Korea by dignitaries of other countries, and make the gift the centerpiece, on a high pedestal dwarfing the other ones.

Park Geun-hye hated dealing with North Korea. Her mother was killed in an assassination attempt on her father, and the agents who did it were sent by the North Korean government. Her diplomacy in the summit reached the precipice of breaking into outrage several times. She was consequently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, only to lose to Narendra Modi, who reconciled India with Manmohan Singh by existing. Her summit proved to be a success, enabling the overseeing of the flow of hard currency into the North Korean regime to make sure that the elite and the military did not seize a disproportionate chunk of it.

And then the inevitable happened. One of Kim Jong-un's personal bodyguards unholstered his pistol when he was giving a speech to the Korean People's Army, and shot the supreme leader in the head before the other bodyguards could do anything. The Korean people had a reaction more mixed than that to Man of Steel. Half cheered in the streets, and the others sat grimly in shock. It was in this situation that Park seized her opportunity. She ordered South Korean troops to push forward into North Korea. Beijing did nothing as the cities of Jilin and Liaoning, which were previously its primary concern, were well-developed and could comfortably handle an exodus of North Korean refugees. Park then did something unpredictable, sending shockwaves throughout the international community; she ordered all American troops to get out of the peninsula.

She then revealed the nuclear weapon that she had been developing underground in Pusan: the Korean rock missile. This angered other governments to no end, with a half dozen embassies withdrawing from the country, and trade sanctions being imposed on the government by the UN. The North Korean military peacefully allowed the South Korean troops to occupy. An iconic image portrayed a North Korean soldier tearfully hugging a South Korean counterpart at the very border in the border town of Panmunjom.

Park officially named the entire peninsula the Republic of Korea, effectively making the entire peninsula one country, rapidly realizing the national dream of unification, plunging the country into a socio-economic and political crisis. Added to this was the factions of the North Korean military that refused to hand over power to their Southern yankee puppets. Park had a very difficult decision at hand.

She finally decided to nuke the region where the 400,000 revolting soldiers had gathered, thus wiping out the opposition, with it the National Gift Museum, which was in the area. Even the centerpiece, which was fiercely guarded in bulletproof glass was shredded in the atomic explosion.

Thus, the RoK rock rocket rocked the RoK rock rock.

Lets be real, majority of India is an uneducated/ignorant, patriarchal , casteist bunch.

192,"The average Nepali loves the average Indian. Indians live and work in Nepal except in government jobs, go to school and colleges with us, many families are mixed nationalities, we have an open border, a shared culture and similar language. The same is true for Nepalis in India. Delhi, Kumaon, Nainital Meghalaya, Assam, Sikkim and Darjeeling are almost like Nepal- many have families there and a big Nepali community. The hate (for lack of better word) that you talk about is against the Indian establishment- the government specifically. The British left, but Delhi Durbar did not. It would probably be  correct to say that the Indians themselves hate the Delhi Durbar. There are some professional agitators and career revolutionaries in Nepal- in order to keep their jobs, they need a bogeyman and it's India for them. 

There are a few drivers of anti Indian sentiment:

1 . The treaty of 1950 (Indo Nepal Freindship Treaty) formalized the current Indo-Nepal relationship. Back then we had two royal families- the traditional Shah and the British installed Rana. The Shahs were the Kings whereas the Rana Dynasty were the PM and the CinC of the military and police. The treaty was signed by the then Rana Rulers of Nepal. This was when Nepal was undergoing a revolution to get rid of the Ranas. The Shah king had taken shelter in Delhi and was bargaining to sign the treaty of ascension with India if he were to be made the President of India- but he held no real power. The leaders of the revolution (the elder brother of my gradfather included) were veterans of the Quit India revolution. The treaty's language  said that it were to nullify the Treaty of Sugauli which was signed after we lost the second Anglo-Nepal war of 1812-1814. That meant we should have gotten the land back from India which we had to surrender in 1814- the Nepali speaking territories that lie in India on both the east and the west. That feeling is subsiding now since it's been about 65 years- but it is there. The Ranas had signed the treaty to appease the Indians so that they could stay in power.

2 . India stationed soldiers in Nepal during the Sino Indian War. From 2 places they have not returned- Susta and Kalapani. You can say that India has annexed the two.

3 . The Treaty of Koshi (with recent flood, it is news again) of 1954- The barrage to prevent flood and facilitate irrigation and generate power was built in Nepali land by Indian money. For that Nepal was supposed to receive a set amount of water for free and also money to compensate the families which had to be relocated. The money never came, also we did not receive the water.

4 . The Gandaki treaty- same story as the Koshi- except we got the money but no water.

5 .The Mahakali Treaty- the story goes like the US-India Nuclear deal, India bribed Nepali parliamentarians to sign the treaty. It is considered higly unequal where Nepal wanted to sell eggs- but India took the hen- because it could. the sad thing is India wants to enter into several power generation and irrigation treaties. The Mahakali was signed 18 years ago- 0% work has been done yet. So the people want to see those three water treaties enforced before Nepal enters any new treaties.

6 . India has built the Khurdlotan Dam and Lakshmanpur Dam to irrigate it's soil- during monsoons this floods Nepali farmer's lands upstream. Mind you these farmers on the border areas often have fields and family on both sides.

7 . 1970s- excited that India had succeded in annexing Sikkin by crook and force, Indira Gandhi tried in the early 1970s to annex the Terai flatlands of Southern Nepal. Imposition of emergency changed the calculus. The Indian forces had largely surrounded and infiltrated the Terai.

8 .Nepal only gets to use the port of Calcutta to trade. Despite repeated requests, and we do pay for the use, India has not let Nepal access to Visakhapatnam in the east or some other port in Western India. Nepal with 24 miliion people is a pretty big nation and as it is spread east to west, a port in the west would help.

9 . The Bangladesh Issue: Nepal is separated from Bangladesh by a 13km wide stretch of land and Nepal has been asking for decades to let Nepali trucks go to Bangladesh. Nepal is a major producer of lentils and Bangladesh a big importer.

These are the major issues and there is a lot of pent up frustration and anger. But it is against the Indian government not people.

But yes there are some racist motherfuckers who do not like Biharis and UP people. It is a very small minority though.

Much of anger/disillusionment you see online is also because of linguistic and cultural issues. Nepal is 24 million people. We border UP (8X), Bihar (5X) and West Bengal (6X) with huge populations. Uttarakhand and Sikkim are the only states we border that have a smaller population. So our language, music, movies get swamped by yours. This makes some people like they are the youngest, smallest guy in the class that has to sit next to the biggest, strongest bully.

Regarding infrastructure built by the Chinese: they do not build these because they feel charitable. They do it because they can trade. It is like the shopkeeper doing home delivery. Power plants- here take some loan: they get goodwill and a place to park their foreign reserves, an avenue to make interest and also Chinese corporations and contractors get contracts. The more electricty we have- the more fridges, fans, ACs, TVs we buy- all made in China. The more the roads the more their cars. The higher our incomes- the higher our imports from China.

Indo-China Game: It is complicated. Nepal has historically had rivalry with Tibetan aristocracy, the leader of which now is the Dalai Lama who would have been like the Ayatollah of Tibet. But, our relationship with the Chinese emperor has historically been very strong. You can see that in our dealing with China. Nepal also helped China take Tibet.

But it has to be noted that Nepal is not landlocked but India locked. The northern border is almost impassable except a few mountain passes. There are only 4-5 all year all weather passes. The three of our borders are with India- and open. There are Indian Nepalis- some of my family included. We share the culture and religion. So, most Nepalis do not choose sides, but mind you-our treaties, there are very few of those with China, have been perceived as fair. Also, when the Chinese companies take up contracts or give foreign aid- their projects complete in time. Also, they do not meddle in the internal political affairs whereas Indian establishment has clear favorites.

Major challenge facing Nepal- poverty, political instability (we do not have a constitution) and the constant struggle of man vs nature i.e we are land locked, mountainous landscape means it is very had to create and maintain insfrastructure.

Modi- About 60% of the Nepali population lives within 30 kms of the Indian border. So people are always trading and travelling across the border. Terai i.e Mithila, Bhojpura and Awadh people make 40% of the population. BJP swept UP, Bihar, and Uttarakhand. It won the constituencies in West Bengal that borders Nepal. All in all BJP won all but one (Sikkim) constituency that borders Nepal. So, there is a lot of hope in Modi. Everyone knows about him, his work in Gujrat and his soft corner for the Sanatan Dharmic people. IMO his party also won Assam and Delhi constituencies where there are tons of Nepalis. So, yes we hope for better.

Also Nepal's relations with India gets better when there is non congress PM in power. Rajiv Gandhi blockaded Nepal twice in 1990s. We do not have a way to get oil, much of food and salt besides importing from India.

These are the issues that bothers the Nepalis. There may be issues which the Indians are not happy about including our failure to prevent the hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight from Kathmandu to Delhi.",2014-08-03 02:47:11

IMO, in a country like India, we don't really have an option but to give some subsidies to our poor. Also, governments give some subsidies all the time to promote some kinds of businesses. For example, if you want to attract, say, high-tech industries in your state, you would have to give some subsidy, otherwise they would not be able to compete with already established players, especially ones that have access to cheaper labor. Organic farmers can not compete with non-organic, because non-organic stuff is obviously gonna give more yield and people would always go for the cheaper option even though they know that the higher cost one is better for them and the environment. Therefore, it makes sense to give some help to the organic farmers so that more people buy organic stuff and the practice gets more popular. Same with solar energy. We know that solar is the cleanest and probably the only sustainable source in the long run. Yet, solar is expensive now and people would opt for coal/hydro electricity and since there is no market for it, no private company would put their money to develop the technology for better solar cells.

I think where they lost some supporters is in going against Modi. Modi has this image of being a quiet, patriotic, nice person, which is very highly regarded by most people. I also hope he will accomplish something for the betterment of this country. 

Unfortunately, someone like Kejriwal who is very outspoken, is usually looked down upon  in this country.

But in my opinion, though both Modi and Kejriwal have the best interests of this country at heart, the people they have surrounded themselves are quite different. Yes, the BJP guys are better than the one in UPA-2, but I was hoping for something better.

&gt; Nepal’s total installed power generation capacity is now just 750 MW—less than 2% of its potential. That is insufficient even to meet Nepal’s own energy needs, forcing the country to endure power cuts of up to 12 hours a day and purchase fuel from India, itself an importer of petroleum products.

They're planning to do away with the duty eventually, taxes on cigarettes are even higher in the West; they're under-taxed here.

&gt;BJP increased import duty on sugar.

Because right-wing economies don't have import and anti-dumping duties?

Nope. It's a combination of selective facts and delusions. Most of the above is stuff practiced by right-wing economies worldwide. The BJP remains a centre-right government.

What next - are they planning to offer a voluntary opt-out scheme for MNREGA? Will they also plan to offer a choice for private cars to pay more for diesel at the pump? Will they offer a chance for farmers who get free/cheap electricity to opt out of it? Are they planning to offer Tata a chance to opt-out of the near zero interest loan of 8000 crores? Pray, tell me?

297,"I live in the US so I can't really echo the sentiments of my compatriots. While watching Nepali news earlier in the evening, we saw the clip of Modi taking this ballsy move to halt his ride and greet the crowd and my dad and a fellow Nepali were quite thrilled. 

From what I hear (and have seen/read on social media), including a few keen followers of politics, Modi is extremely well liked and highly respected. 

Nepal's always been crippled with self-inflicted issues pertaining to Nepal-India relationship. If a leader of leading political party makes a move to strengthen the tie, some new conspiracy theory arises and that's been quite detrimental. In reality, seeing India and China take gigantic strides of development, we should've made progress at similar rate. What's more, our population is so freaking tiny compared to India and if the politicians got into the act together, we could definitely made great progress, too. 

All in all, Modi's reception has been quite surprising. Not that I'd come across anybody unhappy with his visit but his gesture and visit has been exceedingly well received and everyone seems quite excited, and hopeful,too. 

But then again, every single Nepali soul felt the same when a humongous number of people turned up for recent election that saw Maoists getting bitch-slapped and humiliated.

The reason I butt in to spoil your party is to illustrate that nobody is perfect. Everybody makes errors. We're all only human. Not even an error but so what if Modi alluded to a Hindu epic, even Kejriwal did it because we're all borne of the same land and share cultural traits. Public figures are *required* by the compulsions of their unique position to reassure the public by sending subtle signals that they're one of them. Even an atheist Siddaramaiah is known to have visited temples. This is not about some fallacy you keep flinging at whoever dares lead you into a discussion more profound than you'd imagined it to be.

Isn't ""not making any sense"" enough proof? 

A monkey man cannot fly because it is against the laws of gravity.. he cannot lift a mountain, because mountains cannot be lifted.. he cannot go to Nepal and come back with the booty to Rama.. because Nepal is pretty far away from where Lakshmana was (somewhere close to Lanka, if the you believe the story).. by the time he had figured out the booty and come back, it would have taken years if not decades..

An avowed Hindu nationalist, Mr. Modi is scheduled to visit the Pashupatinath temple, one of Hinduism’s holiest places, on Monday, an arrangement made in part to coincide with a religiously auspicious day.

&gt; “To avoid any misperception, Modi must clearly support the current draft Constitution’s identification of Nepal as a ‘federal, secular democratic republic,’ ” C. Raja Mohan, an Indian foreign affairs analyst, wrote in an opinion piece on Sunday.

... and then
&gt; In his speech, Mr. Modi described Nepal as a “federal democratic republic,” dropping the “secular,” long a fraught word in Indian politics as well. But he did not call for explicit Hindu identification and said Nepal was “the birthplace of Lord Buddha.”

The seculars keep following him.

317,"All your Hindu organizations did in Saharanpur was sensationalize the issue to make Muslims look evil and to make Sikhs look like the brothers of Hindus being oppressed in India. The Saharanpur riots had violence on both sides, just like the Hyderabad ones (which were similarly sensationalized). When there was a news story of Muslims giving out water to Sikhs in Amritsar during 1984 memorial, people like you claimed it was photoshopped. When there were Hinsu-Sikh riots in Gurdaspur a year ago, the Sikhs were blamed as ""Khalistanis."" Yet when Muslim-Sikh riots happen, it's Sikhs being oppressed. When 1984 comes up, people say ""why bring up old wounds, lets forget the bad that happened."" When Partition comes up, everyone makes movies showing the Sikhs as heroes killing and defending themselves from the evil Muslims when it was nowhere near like that.

When we do things that fit what Hindu nationalists seem appropriate for us, ""Sikhs are an integral part of India, Hindu-Sikh Bhai-Bhai."" When we are seen as ""stepping out of line,"" we are seen as Khalistanis who must be eliminated.

&gt;The RSS protected Sikhs in 84

No actual source on this but people keep talking. Yes, Congress incited most of the violence, but many eye witnesses to the violence witnessed RSS as well. This is in line with the RSS chief recently praising Indira Gandhi ""for her stance against terror."" The reason you don't hear it is because hardly anyone cares about the victims; it's come to light recently to be used as political ammo against Congress when they talk about Modi. If the RSS and BJP really did care, perhaps they could've helped the victims when Vajpayee was in office. ",2014-08-04 19:22:34

These firms will have to compulsorily provide details of the purpose and the details of the visits by these foreign nationals to the Intelligence Bureau, it said. The Defence Ministry has also made it mandatory for the private defence firms to deploy a security guard with the foreign nationals while they are visiting their facilities, it said. 

Defence Ministry officials said foreigners would not be allowed to visit the areas in the facility where work on Ministry of Defence projects is going on. The Ministry of Defence has also put these companies under the purview of the Official Secrets Act and any violation or non-compliance of the directions would be strictly penalised by the authorities concerned, the circular said. 

Steps such as delicensing a large number of defence-related equipment and increase in the FDI limit by the NDA government are expected to draw a large number of firms in the military manufacturing sector in the near future.",2014-08-05 15:13:34

* Nepal planned to blast away the debris to free the river which would mean that all the accumulated water would be release immediately

* This would have meant that we would have had to evacuate 1.5 lakh people in 8 districts in Bihar. Despite best efforts, there would have been a lot of loss of life and property, not to mention the amount of resources that government would have to spend in rescue and restoration efforts

* Due to discussions and negotiations with our government, Nepal agreed to release the water slowly in a regulated way through 2-3 holes created in the artificial lake. This would mean that the flow of water in India would be manageable. There would still be evacuation of three districts -  Supual, Saharsa and Madhepura.

393,"Full article because the damned site asks you to register.

&gt;MUSTAQ and his younger brother Syed recall this year’s Eid as a “sugar-free” one. “It wasn’t sweet enough to be greeted. It was an Eid where we offered namaz with distasteful memories. No one left their homes. And no one demanded their eidi [gifts from elders],” said 21-year-old Mustaq, an engineer, as his brother nodded in gloomy agreement.

&gt;Many people in Saharanpur, a city in western Uttar Pradesh known for its exquisite furniture designs and a cloth market, had an Eid without sugar or milk in their homes as the city remained under a curfew following riots between two minority groups, Sikhs and Muslims, on July 26. The riots claimed three lives and left at least 50 people injured, and fear loomed over the city when the government relaxed the curfew for namaz. Since then prices of essential commodities and other household items have skyrocketed as supplies have stopped.

&gt;In the early hours of July 26, some Muslims who had woken up for the regular Ramzan ritual of sahri (pre-dawn meal) were informed in the mosques that the main gurdwara had started constructing a plinth on a piece of land claimed by both Muslims and Sikhs. By around 5 a.m., some political workers among the Muslims mobilised a group of 200 to protest against the gurdwara’s action, at the disputed site in the Qutubsher area of the town. According to many witnesses Frontline spoke to, the group turned into a mob of almost 5,000 within a couple of hours. The mob, which initially pelted the gurdwara’s kirtan mandali—a group of religious workers that sings devotional songs—with stones, gradually turned more aggressive and looted and burned down shops owned by Sikhs and Hindus. Some members of the Sikh community retaliated by resorting to similar action in the Muslim-dominated areas of the city.

&gt;The violence continued unabated for five hours as the police and district administrative officials looked on helplessly. It was finally halted after the police clamped a curfew. Although the situation has been brought under control, the fault line that has developed between the Muslims and the Sikhs is, perhaps, here to stay.

&gt;Sikhs have aligned themselves with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the aftermath of the riots. The BJP always had the support of Punjabi Hindu communities and this incident has further strengthened the party’s hold on them.

&gt;A five-member team, which included Suresh Rana, a BJP legislator from the Thana Bhawan constituency in Shamli district of western Uttar Pradesh and one of the main accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots last year, visited the gurdwara and pledged its support for the Sikhs. “The Samajwadi Party encouraged the riots and has refused to arrest the perpetrators. The violence in Saharanpur shows careful planning as the mob used chemicals to burn the shops of our brethren. The riots saw targeted killings and the administration has refused to take any action. The situation is under control only because of the honourable Union Home Minister, Rajnath Singh,” Rana told Frontline.

&gt;Leaders of the BJP are moving around the city to consolidate the support of non-Muslims and, similarly, the Muslim leadership has been trying to consolidate its own base. Saharanpur is geared to hold an Assembly byelection. Its legislator, Raghav Lakhanpal of the BJP, became a Member of Parliament by winning the Saharanpur seat in the 2014 general election. While the BJP won with handsome margins in all the other constituencies in western Uttar Pradesh, it could wrest the Saharanpur seat only by a margin of 65,000 votes. Lakhanpal defeated the Congress’ Imran Masood, a Muslim leader known for his inflammatory speeches (in his election campaign, he allegedly threatened to “chop” Narendra Modi “into pieces”).

&gt;Although many election analysts attribute the BJP’s sweep in the last parliamentary election in western Uttar Pradesh to the strong polarisation between Muslims and Hindus in the aftermath of the Muzaffarnagar riots, the hard-fought election in Saharanpur, however, indicated that the religious polarisation was incomplete.

&gt;**The disputed land**

&gt;The trigger for the riots was a long-simmering dispute over a piece of land which the Muslims claim housed a masjid that was subsequently demolished while the Guru Singh Sabha, the administrative body of the gurdwara, says that there was no masjid when it bought the land in 2001 and that the gurdwara is the land’s rightful owner. Anwar Ali, a senior advocate in the city and an Urdu columnist, told Frontline that the dispute was unjustified because the matter had been resolved by the Allahabad High Court in 1964. “The Muslims were led to believe that there existed a public mosque in the land adjoining the gurdwara. However, the mosque that existed in that land can at best be called a private mosque. All communities in India have a tradition to build places of worship in their homes,” said Ali.

&gt;The case, Sheikh Mohammad Askari vs Khalil Ahmad, is recorded in the Reference no: 1964/Allahabad Law Journal, Page 1122. One Sheikh Mohammad Askari’s house stood at the disputed site. The house on Gurdwara Road, which was then called Malgodam Road, was called Peeli Kothi. In 1936, Askari requested the Collector to liquidate his assets in order to pay off his large debt. The Collector referred the case to a special judge under the then Encumbered Estates Act. On January 8, 1936, the U.P. official gazette notified the district administration to auction his property. As his property included Peeli Kothi, it also had to be auctioned.

&gt;However, a Muslim leader, Khalil Ahmad, objected to the auction of Peeli Kothi, claiming that it housed a public masjid. The case continued until November 26, 1948, when the court permitted Askari to auction the property.

&gt;As a result of the judgment, he sold Peeli Kothi to Srimati Mansa Devi and Rajvanti Devi, two women from an influential business family. Khalil Ahmad, however, moved the court again against the sale. His argument was based on two points: firstly, the portion of the Kothi comprising the masjid was not liable to be sold, and, secondly, common people have the right to offer prayers there.

&gt;The purchasers of the Kothi and two other creditors objected to the case, following which Khalil Ahmad’s case was dismissed on December 3, 1951. Ahmad appealed in the Allahabad High Court in 1952. The High Court, however, dismissed his plea with a judgment on September 1, 1964. Justice Gyanendra Kumar concluded that the masjid was indeed a private mosque as it was not proved that the public had any access at any time to the masjid. He said that the masjid was located in the north-west part of the premises and there was only one access to Peeli Kothi. Therefore, the sale deed was valid. In this way, he made an important distinction between a public mosque and a private one. This land was bought by the Guru Singh Sabha in 2001.

&gt;In 2009, some Muslim political workers formed a “masjid committee” under the leadership of one Abdul Wahab to seek public access to the masjid. However, it did not take off well as Wahab died. Moharram Ali Pappu, a former councillor in the Saharanpur Municipal Corporation, and the main accused in the Saharanpur riots, raised the matter again by filing a similar case in the Additional District Court in 2011. Political observers say that by raising the sentimental issue just ahead of the 2012 Assembly elections, he was looking to consolidate the Muslim vote. Again, the matter remained a non-issue among Muslims and Pappu struck a compromise with the gurdwara committee, after which the case was closed by the Additional District Judge in May 2013 in the gurdwara’s favour. Six months later, in an attempt to revive the issue, a close associate of Pappu filed another case in the District Court. This case is still on.

395,"&gt; First, the mood of the Congress hardened during the course of this session of Parliament. In the early days following the Budget, senior Congress politicians had informally indicated they would back the Insurance Bill. In the weeks that followed, Sonia Gandhi changed her mind and calculated a determined attack was the better option. This was probably linked to her personal implication in the National Herald case.

&gt; Second, the intellectual content to the Opposition's firepower came from the Trinamool and the Left Front. The Congress contributed nothing; it raised no robust objections to the Insurance Bill and suggested no concrete changes. In fact, it did not propose a single amendment. This would indicate its decision to not allow a vote was an afterthought.

&gt; Third, the Opposition wants to deny Narendra Modi a new insurance law that he can showcase as a symbol of opening up the economy when he travels to the US in September, and particularly for his meetings with American CEOs. In this it would appear to have succeeded. Unless there is a dramatic turnaround, the Insurance Bill will go to a Select Committee, be voted on in - and perhaps even be rejected by - the Rajya Sabha in the Winter Session in November, and then be passed by a Joint Session.

Think of it like subsidized train tickets. While pricing of private sector insurance includes a large profit margin over the actuarial calculations, govt health insurance can be subsidized. Read 

&gt;“The aim is to provide a basic minimum health insurance cover to all. The rate of the premium for the middle class could be dependent on one’s income. But for the poor it would be very nominal,” a government official said.  [OP]

As to the competition, the idea is that:

&gt;The proposed amendment will pave the way for infusion of the much-needed additional equity to the tune of Rs.25,000 crore into the insurance sector.

&gt;While up to 26 per cent foreign investment will be allowed automatically, any FDI beyond that will require approval through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/insurance-bill-pm-narendra-modi-meets-ministers-defers-all-party-meet/1/375757.html

The idea isn't to simply stimulate the insurance sector, but to encourage more health technology infrastructure development. So while the drug industry is doing well, things like last mile reach of clinics and hospitals, MBBS colleges, specialization and super-specialization education, anti-epidemic services and infra, etc. are still very weak.

Not for any person's personal gain. As long as the gift furthers the national relationship, it's all good. When personal gifts are exchanged between heads of nations, 

Modi is neither simplistic nor a blind religious zealot. He doesn't need to give religious gifts to another country for his own religious satisfaction. Plus, I don't think Modi thought of the sandalwood and ghee as appropriate gifts (among the countless other equally religious gifts) all by himself. There must have been some evaluation done for the most appropriate gift, and Nepal or the temple must have communicated these items as a definite need they have. Which is why, those particular gifts were chosen after careful thought and consideration. By giving this gift, he sought to place an emphasis on the deep cultural and spiritual heritage the two nations share, and going by public reactions in Nepal, it seems to have helped.

Plus other subsidies like cheap electricity, cheap land etc. Net cost to Gujarat citizens is 30000 crores. Net jobs (direct and indirect) expected to be generated 10000. So cost per job - 3 crore. Plus after this loan, Tata has cut down their manufacturing in Gujarat - so may be not even the 10000 jobs generated.

&gt;Immediately after the Nano deal was sealed, Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation had taken six villages under acquisition in Sanand. Farmers were under the impression that the authorities will take away their land for free. In protest, about 3,000 of them took out a procession last year and threatened to end their lives if forced to give up their land. Pointing out the gaucheness in their modus operandi, Vaghela advised the government to first tell the farmers the price on offer for their land and then try to convince them to sell. Paying heed to this advice, the government declared the price of the land at Rs 1,200 per square meter at Bol (a village inside the Sanand Taluka), four-times better than the market price.

&gt;The opposition crumbled — the government smiled and Bol got richer by Rs 900 crore in a matter of days.

&gt;It is now reported by Business Standard that the production has commenced once again. And this time, the car maker is not manufacturing the same old Nano variant, but the facelift variant. Currently pre-production trials are being carrying out. Full fledged production is expected to start later this month or early next month. Vendors from the vendor park inside the premises of the plant, have confirmed increased orders for the new variant.


Come on, look beyond unfounded accusations. There is enough stuff there for people to criticize Modi. But use of half-truths and lies are only going to make your case weaker.",2014-08-07 14:01:42

480,"Intent?

Intent was always there, and I saw it as I watched idea after idea shot down, and compromise after compromise take hold and stifle any growth. 

Also I really don;t like this idea that they ""rode the ABV wave"". By that logic, ABV rode the 1991 wave which was still going on. It opens the field to a discussion of effects beyond just party structure and politics.

Heck, in that case Modi MUST do well because he is inheriting a post recession world. And any government between 2008-2013 was bound to fail because of the crash. 

So, I avoid that ""ABV wave"" and other comments, you really just open the field up, and get stuck in nitty gritty which is germane to the point.

UPA 1 was decent - given their handicaps. But given the promise. They failed. Coalition politics is the number 1 issue with it, any good idea was lost to compromise and politicing. 


And yes those bills were major bills,  I add the service tax update as well, since I know of it, and a few other law changes they made. The nuclear bill alone was MMS' baby and in the face of opposition internationally, domestically, within coalition and within party. Its frankly bizzarre that it survived.

485,"Tke a look at the nitty gritty of the service tax bill. I'm half horrified by the complexity and half impressed with the deviousness by which the grey market and unorganized sector is being tamed. I fought against NREGA initially (who wouldn't? Digging holes to fill holes?) but over time I accepted that it's acting like a minimum wage. 

There's a lot of things that the UPA did that they should have communicated.

I can say they weren't as bad as they are made out to be. But they aren't as good as they were supposed to be. 

Heck, economic growth was strong in UPA 1, take a look at the macro numbers. The economy was and is stronger since the abv days.

UPA 2 managed to straddle a huge recession unlike any we have seen in nearly a decade. I doubt anyone could have done anything at that stage, for the economy. What could they do?

The jobless growth is something that needs to be fixed today for sure. 

And so far modi has done nearly everything I bet he would, except a Big Bang budget and minister choosing. He's improving the armed forces, strengthening spy agencies, loosening environmental norms, stopping with the non essential communication - in general being focused on the job and prepping to improve state center responsiveness. 

Look I don't have chapter and verse to point to. I'm not saying UPA was great, they failed the expectations of a mms lead govt. but they aren't as bad as the running circle jerk on the forum and elsewhere.

As for executive paralysis - it's squarely on congress HO and coalition brinkmanship. They played it too safe and catered too much to outside help.
I think in retrospect they realize it may have been better to fall as a govt than be so ineffective.

486,"Yeah, and btw this is what Congress in Gujarat was up to in 2002.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cong-silent-on-cadres-linked-to-Guj-riots/articleshow/122796.cms

&gt;The Congress has been going to town over Best Bakery and other instances of the Narendra Modi government's complicity in the anti-Muslim violence which shook Gujarat last year. 

&gt;But when it comes to the involvement of its own party cadre in the killings, 10 Janpath maintains a deafening silence. Even when confronted by a long-standing ally from the freedom movement days, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. 

&gt;According to the JUH, ""most Congress corporators"" and some Congress leaders of Gujarat had actively participated in last year's riots. 

&gt;Mahmood As'ad Madani, JUH general secretary told The Times of India: ""We wrote letters to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, gave a list of Congress leaders involved in the riots, asked her to take action against them but to no avail."" 

&gt;On April 29, 2002, for example, the JUH received a list of 25 Congress leaders from its Gujarat chapter, which was promptly forwarded to her. This included a former Congress minister, a sitting MLA and a former MP. 

BTW Gujarat Congress is headed by former RSS stalwart Shankersingh Vaghela. Have a nice day.",2014-08-07 17:26:27
487,"&gt;PM's silence on this is dangerous and indicative of his implicit consent on what is going on

No, it's indicative of how Modi-baiters love jumping to conclusions to find a way to blame everything on him. 

I remember once reading that infamous poster, u/sanskarimata blaming Modi for the IPL and spot fixing scam by going *'He is the head of Gujarat Cricket Board---&gt;Hasn't done anything about BCCI scams---&gt;He is either personally involved or is abandoning his duties, a crime, jail him!'*",2014-08-07 17:33:55

Agreed that Kodnani and Bajrangi should not have been given bail and also that Modi should weed out people who instigate communal propaganda. But he still is part of that party and can not do it without pissing off a lot of them. Not to mention Sangh.

Calling Emergency for such matters is not wise in my opinion.",2014-08-07 20:07:07
