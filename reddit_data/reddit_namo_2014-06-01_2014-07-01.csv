&gt; Criticising the diesel price hike, Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said it would affect farmers the most.
“There have been deficient rains in some states...by increasing diesel prices by Rs 5 per litre, the government has created more pain for those who are already suffering,” Modi said, addressing a poll rally at Valsad in south Gujarat.
“The diesel hike will have a cascading effect and prices of all essential things will go up. This price hike will prove to be very bad for the farmers of the state where there is drought-like situation,” Modi said.
Targeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the price hike, he said, “The prime minister is sinking the ship of this country.”

I can understand Al Beruni's view, what I can not understand is the text books uncritical endorsement of the same without presenting any contrary narrative. Further, this view is presented at an age when children believe anything in the books they read as THE truth. 

I would have understood if Beruni's view point and that of someone else had been presented in a text box and students had been encouraged to debate about which view had more validity, or what was the basis on which such questions could be answered, but the completely uncritical way in which Beruni's view is endorsed is beyond ridiculous.

It is even more ridiculous, that in the course of one reddit comment, you say that Beruni's views were basically what is called xenophobia today, and in the very next paragraph, you say that opinion should be taught! Because, really, what else do we have to teach? Then you go on to illustrate this with how the Brits have a different viewpoint of our independence struggle. Why not teach that too? After all, Kipling was a renowned ""Indologist"" (or what passed for that in those days) of his time!

Why does this notion of critical dualistic endorsement suggested only when there is a critical narrative regarding India or its history? Does Bhagat Singh's narrative have an alternative, or is Gandhi's position in Indian history textbooks ever challenged?  

&gt; Simply put, this is the UPA govt. hired hands brain washing Indian kids to believe in a particular version of history and to make them feel culturally inferior.

Can you suggest that the RSS and states are setting up syllabi to show a particular version of history which shows India in exceedingly flattering light?

---

Again, I am suggesting that kids should be made aware of the historical method. I don't think students of 5th standard and above are incapable of understanding concepts such as those. That is when the neocortex really develops. That way kids can critically examine anything that is thrown at them. 

**Edit**: And finally you are calling for a very dangerous precedent: *Ms Irani and NaMo have their work cut out for them*
