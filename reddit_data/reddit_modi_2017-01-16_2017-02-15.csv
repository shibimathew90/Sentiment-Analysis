If you build a 50 ft wall, you will get a 51 feet ladder. Just as lefties in US argue its impossible to stop immigration, its impossible to build a hack-proof system. 

RSS is a boogeyman lefties use. They will never takeover India. I am not living there now but have lived there till recently so I am quite well aware, have family there. 

Yes Modi the Fascist is a trope I always hear, I am dismissing people because paranoia is not a healthy thing neither is it truthful. Modi can never be fascist because India is too diverse to follow one leader. Most of south, NE is out of BJP's bound. 

Also people are more intelligent than given credit for. Indira Gandhi was thrown out too when she tried her fascism move. It's just that the people who replaced her was so incompetent that people elected her back because atleast she was capable. 
Right now we have BJP, before that Congress got 2 terms. It's not that people have become RSS-Hindutvavadi, it's just that people are voting for those they think will improve their lives.

2009 re-election was solely because of MMS, because he was seen as competent and the factors were in his favour. If he was not so submissive to Gandhis and rather than cowtowing to Madam Gandhi, had he shown some spine and purged the sycophants and corrupt ministers and had Congress been politically better rather than just propping up a incompetent person like Rahul Gandhi, they would have been re-elected.

People voted for Modi because they found him capable of bringing change. If he doesn't he will be voted out too. 

Also doesn't help Modi's opposition are so transparently incompetent. They are still playing to old secular-minority card game and they will loose too. 
India is changing, its more aspirational. They will vote for those who help them achieve those aspirations. I see the same thing happening in India as it is happening in US. The so called lefties or ""liberals"" have no grassroot understanding of things. Everyone who does not agree with them is branded racist, fascist, bhakt etc. They don't possess neither understand nuance. As much as I support most of liberal causes, I wish they face humiliating political losses in US and India to knock some sense into them. Pragmatism is what is required which many lack unfortunately.

My friend did this once. 

Me: ""Kya yaar, Modi launched a Swacchh Bharat campaign and you are littering on the road like this. Take it and throw it when you reach home.""

He always praises the government, so I thought saying something like that will be enough to motivate him. However...

Him: ""Okay, if you support Swacchh Bharat so much then why don't you pick it up and keep it?""

I didn't know what to say.",2017-01-16 00:43:50
2,"&gt;  your biggest fear is poor laborers and their uneducated families migrating from Bangladesh? 




Very legitimate issue in Assam and Bangladesh. This is one of the reasons for a BJP sweep in Assam.




Besides, Modi's main pitch was development, not fear. The boogeyman was a factor brought about in some areas, but that's politics. Every single political party across the world uses fear to some extent. As you keep referring to US examples, the Democrats entire campaign was based on the premise that Trump is a racist, sexist, xenophobic, -ic, -ist, etc, who will completely ruin the country and lead to nuclear war. Is this not eliciting fear? When Trump won, there were riots, as people feared his future dictatorship, because that's what the MSM has been repeatedly saying. Similarly, in India, INC, AAP, JDU, BSP, AIMIM, and a few more parties, pretty much only campaigned on the premise that Modi is dangerous and will organise genocides and massacres. Is this not eliciting fear?",2017-01-16 00:49:15

From using it against Sonia Gandhi to sending his BJP online goons after Aamir Khan for being a muslim speaking about tolerance, how is he different? 

Unlike Trump, he looked the other way during a pogrom. He is a total narcissist who refers to himself in 3rd person. He changes Gandhi for a picture of himself.

The similarities are striking but some people's ego are bruised by the comparison, because it doesn't speak well about the Indian electorate, even worse, it doesn't speak well about *them* because they support him. It becomes personal.",2017-01-16 00:54:00

I blame it on the education system for not teaching anything about critical thinking, most Indians don't even know what it means. (For other victims of our broken education system, ""critical thinking"" means having the ability to criticize everything fairly, i.e. being skeptical and having the ability to evaluate claims and presented evidence). 

I'm pursuing an undergrad science degree in Canada and there is so much emphasis on critical thinking that it's incredible. One of the courses that I've had was basically taking recently-published papers in very prominent journals by researchers from prominent universities, spending two weeks reading and analyzing the paper and figuring out why their claims were bullshit. 

We in Canada are taught not to believe in research coming out of schools like Harvard published in journals like Nature and Science without evaluating it, Indians fall for a claim made by a 14 year old boy. It's endemic.",2017-01-16 03:58:41

That's just not true. The UG education in developed countries vs in India is worlds apart, especially in research-driven subjects like biology, which is one of my majors. Every thing that we learn from the start is in the context of producing good research papers. From what I know about Indian education, biology education is basically: ""here's a textbook with a bunch of content, memorize everything and be prepared for the exam, ok?"". Also suddenly you're showing so much skepticism, I didn't know that my comment would have immediate effect. I can assure you that what I've said is true.

&gt;so much for your critical thinking! but I did bring modi in here because this is related to vibrant gujarat, a pet of modi's.

Not everything in Gujarat is related to Vibrant Gujarat, which refers to a very specific campaign and summit. Not everything in Gujarat is directly linked to Modi. India is still India. Gujarat and its government are not necessarily direct brainchilds of Modi. Even someone with 2 terms as CM cannot change so much that you can attribute all successes and failures of Gujarat to Modi.

&gt;some 450 teachers were trained for one week and dressed in suits to pose as CEOs at vibrant gujarat,

That is literally fake news. These teachers were trained to be *ushers* for real CEOs. Literally. Fake. News. This is what I mean by lack of critical thinking. Of course, you don't want to show skepticism here, because it aligns with your agenda.",2017-01-16 04:35:03

You see, this is why Hillary lost in America. 

The poor laborers and uneducated families from Bangladesh are after the same limited number of jobs as the poor laborers and uneducated families in India. In Assam, for example, BJP/Modi recognize this *legitimate* concern of a large portion of the population while the Congress and the Delhi Media does not from their Ivory tower.

Trump was elected by the working-class blue-collar worker because of a similar *real* loss of employment opportunities for them. That you dismiss these genuine issues as irrelevant is what causes people to vote for the Right, which does at least give an indication that something is wrong.

Now, we know that jobs are lost not necessarily because of cheaper labor, but also increasing automation in this era. However, it is not yet recognized by the working class who have seen a personal decline in their own employment status. ",2017-01-16 04:37:03
10,"this is exactly what i am talking about. fekugiri is not always outright lies, it is twisting of facts.

just some components are being manufactured in india. cryostats are apparently vacuum tight containers, not much to do with fusion as such. it is still a good thing, but blown way out of proportion. I am guessing Institute for Plasma Research is overseeing their production. IPR is a central institute set up long ago. nothing to do with modi.

it is a reliance factory, set up much before modi's tenure as CM. besides, refineries are set up on coastal areas. given that oil imports come from the western side of india, it makes sense to have most of the refineries on the west coast. given ambanis are from gujarat, it was an easy choice for them. it has nothing to do with govt policy.

&gt; Alang Ship-breaking yard

again nothing to do with modi or his govt policy.

I'm curious: how do you think that Gujarat has remained as ""top 2-3 most industrialized states"" if *NOT* for government policy, at least partially? Does ease of doing business and cutting down red tape have nothing to do with it?

yes, i didn't know. there are thousands of contracts across india that i don't know of.

&gt; how do you think that Gujarat has remained as ""top 2-3 most industrialized states"" if NOT for government policy

gujaratis are generally an entrepreneurial people. gujarat was a commercial center for centuries if not decades. there were several prominent gujarati businessmen like ambani who aided in its industrial development. promixity to mumbai is very helpful. long coast line helps.

i visited gujarat several times in early 2000s. it was already a pretty industrialized state. one thing that amazed me back then was the level of decentralization in the spread of industries. if there is one thing that must be replicated form gujarat across india, it is that decentralization. but it has nothing to do with modi.

post liberalization, all southern states, maharashtra and gujarat did well even in times of political instability. that is because first of all economic policies are determined largely by the central govt and second because these states already had a good base to start with for newer industries. all these states already had better administration than BIMARU states. all that the govts had to do was not to screw that up. modi or CBN or jayalalitha or SM Krishna infused some discipline in their state administrations and thats it for the most part there was no visionary policy making as such. If anything, the southern states were the visionaries in terms of policy in attracting IT and allied industries and even pharma and biotech industries. in gujarat, the industries still largely provide only blue collar jobs.",2017-01-16 05:31:40

thats because you are UG and I am much higher up the academic ladder that I get a bird's eye view of the bullshit that you mistake for academic rigor and critical thinking.

&gt;  especially in research-driven subjects like biology, which is one of my majors. Every thing that we learn from the start is in the context of producing good research papers

I don't know what to say to this. research in areas like biology is very weird. quite often even phds don't do much research in the sense that no new idea is produced by them. also, papers in biology often have a ton of authors, most of whose role is nothing more than that of a lab assistant. stick around for a few more years in your area and you'll learn many ugly truths.

&gt; CM cannot change so much that you can attribute all successes and failures of Gujarat to Modi

I am not. but it is also a fact that modi and amit shah have a huge influence in gujarat. in any case, the situation does relate to vibrant gujarat. so i don't know why you are saying 

&gt; Not everything in Gujarat is related to Vibrant Gujarat

&gt; These teachers were trained to be ushers for real CEOs

why would an event management company hand pick teachers to be ushers. there is no shortage of people in india who would want to work as ushers for cheap wages. in any case, what I read was that apart from serving as ushers, they were also used to inflate the number of attendees, presumably in photos. such tricks are not at all uncommon. to be fair, they are not even restricted to BJP or even India. such PR tricks happen even in countries like US.

&gt; Of course, you don't want to show skepticism here, because it aligns with your agenda.

I think I saw a clip from a gujarati newspaper. i can't read gujarati myself. but the newspaper in question, gujarat samachar seems to be a well established newspaper. second, it is totally common for crowds to be paid to attend political rallies. and vibrant gujarat is part political rally. modi and his supporters have been caught in the past faking things, including posting photo-shopped pictures for PR purposes. so it is not unbelievable that there were fake CEOs at vibrant gujarat, which is a major PR exercise. finally, neither gujarat govt nor bjp have denied or rebutted the claim. so, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, i will believe the news article at least to the extent anything in the political world can be believed.",2017-01-16 05:47:30

  NEW DELHI: France has appreciated demonetisation in India, terming it as a ""bold"" decision which ""shows how determined"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to combat tax evasion, corruption and black money.
  





  French Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Jean-Marc Ayrault also hailed the ""significant reforms"" undertaken by Modi to attract foreign investments, saying ""they are in the right direction"".
  





  Appreciating the 'Make in India' initiative, he told PTI in an interview that France ""wishes to be a major partner, thanks to its experience, expertise and recognised technologies"".
  





  At the same time, he said ""joint efforts"" should be made between the European Union and India to reduce trade barriers and pitched for reforms in India with regard to easing the import-export regime and improving the predictability and stability of regulations.
  





  ""I am impressed by the boldness of this decision. It shows how determined Prime Minister Modi is to combat tax evasion, corruption and black money. It's also a measure aimed at modernizing the economy by accelerating the transition to a digital economy,"" Ayrault, who was here on a four-day visit, said when his views were sought on demonetisation.
  





  ""We are following these developments with keen interest,"" he added.
  





  He said ""The Indian economy is full of promise for entrepreneurs and we trust the government's resolve to support the country's economic development.""
  





  The French Minister, who was here primarily to attend Vibrant Gujarat, said the bilateral economic ties ""are being ceaselessly strengthened"".
  





  Pointing out that French companies have a very strong presence in India, he said they ""invest, innovate and make in India"".
  





  About 1000 French entities are spread all over the Indian territory, employing almost 3,50,000 skilled workers, and the general feeling is that this is a land ""full of opportunities"", he said.
  





  However, bilateral trade remains at a ""more modest level"", which is also due to French companies fully adopting the 'Make in India' policy.
  





  ""But we must continue our joint efforts, between the European Union and India, to reduce trade barriers,"" he said.
  





  Reminding that the EU, of which France is a member, is India's top exports destination, Ayrault said, ""It will remain so despite Brexit"".
  





  The French Minister said Modi has undertaken ""significant reforms"" to attract foreign investments, and ""they are in the right direction"". These efforts, he said, ""are yielding fruit, with FDIs spiralling over the past few years"".
  





  He said France, which is one of India's main foreign investors, intends to play a major role in these developments.
  





  ""Our companies are fully aware of the prospects open to them in a vast variety of fast-expanding sectors, like renewable energy or sustainable urban development, which Prime Minister Modi has declared to be a priority, and in which our companies have great expertise and can offer innovative technology,"" he said.
  





  He noted that French companies already account for 10 per cent of India's installed solar capacity.
  





  With regard to ease of doing business in India, Ayrault said, ""What's sure is that the Indian market is attractive for our companies, which are gearing up for success. They are in India for the long haul.""
  





  He said the French companies continued their investments regardless of the global economic situation. ""And they innovate in India. They have thus shown that they can prepare for the future and are confident of India's future,"" he said, adding the reforms ""have played and are playing a very positive role in this respect.""
  





  There are ""other areas in which reforms could be pursued, for example, with regard to easing the import-export regime, or improving the predictability and stability of regulations,"" the minister said.
  





  On 'Make in India', he said the French companies have ""fully incorporated"" it in their policy and wish to make the most of the opportunities it presents.
  





  ""There are so many wonderful examples of success,"" he said.
  





  He named Renault, saying it has become the top European manufacturer in the Indian market with the Kwid.
  





  Referring to Decathlon, he said the sports goods manufacturer and distributor has opened 50 outlets all over India.
  





Alstom Transport, he said, will invest in a plant in Bihar for building 800 electric locomotives.
  





  ""In the course of my trip, I have met many of our companies, dynamic and innovative enterprises that have all reiterated the same view - India is full of opportunities, and our companies are ready to seize them,"" he said.

It's not a legitimate concern, but again I said that's ""besides the point"".

The reason it's not a legitimate concern is because, the limited number of jobs is not equal to the number of people who want them, and neither number can be artificially stabilized. You cannot reduce the number of people (short of horrifying eugenics) and you cannot artificially increase the number of jobs (short of banning technological progress).

So there have to be *better* answers to this problem, but deportation and saying ""we will be tough on migrants"" is an easy way to pretend to be strong and to make the fear bigger than it actually is, which was my point all along.

  KVIC is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament and is tasked with promoting the use of khadi in the country. Khadi is handspun and hand-woven cotton cloth, championed by Mahatma Gandhi during India’s Independence movement.  

 

  KVIC’s calendar and diary mostly use the iconic image of Mahatma Gandhi at the spinning wheel (charkha). But KVIC officials, speaking off record, said this is not the first time their annual publications have not used the Mahatma’s image. Five times in the past, they said, images of ordinary citizens have been used in these publications.  

 

  A top KVIC official said the decision to use the PM’s image was based on the judgement that he “was a popular face and has also been a staunch supporter of khadi”. “Last October, Modiji distributed 500 charkhas to women spinners in Ludhiana. It was then decided to print his picture on calendars to commemorate that event,” this official said.  

 

  KVIC chief VK Saxena, who was appointed by the National Democratic Alliance government in 2015, had recently said using the PM’s image was “relevant to the core values” of KVIC and that the decision was based on the fact that Modi as PM has given a boost to khadi. He had said sales in 2015-16 had jumped 34%, a sharp rise from the 2-7% growth seen in the decade before that.

30,"&gt;Yet according to Pew, a research firm, the prime minister’s popularity in mid-2016, at an enviable 81%, had declined only marginally from a stunning 87% the year before. The liking is personal: Mr Modi regularly scores higher in such polls than either his party or his policies.

&gt;Some pundits speak of “Modi magic” to explain his immunity from criticism, but there are more straightforward reasons. One is the prime minister’s talent as a politician. Although often dour in countenance, Mr Modi is a pithy speaker in Hindi, with an unerring nose for the class-driven grudges that often guide voter sentiment. In debates over demonetisation, he successfully projected himself as a champion of the common man against currency hoarders and tax evaders. He is also extremely protective of his own image as a man above the fray. Mr Modi’s dress, gestures and public appearances are theatrically staid and uniform, punctuated by meaningful looks and silences. He does not hold press conferences, preferring to retain control of his narrative via carefully rehearsed interviews and his monthly “From the Heart” radio address.


Are there anyone yet find it hard to believe that Modiji will win 2019. I don't think people even understand how big of a mess this whole demonetization drama was.

&gt;Other institutions that might check Mr Modi’s ambitions, such as the press and the judiciary, are also not as vigilant as in other democracies. Some parts of the media are owned by Mr Modi’s friends and supporters; others by business groups with interests that are vulnerable to retribution. Journalists, whistle-blowers and activists are keenly aware that critics of the government often pay a price, whether in the form of “trolling” on the internet, harassment by officials or spurious lawsuits. India’s courts, meanwhile, do often clash with the government but are cautious in picking fights: on January 11th India’s supreme court airily dismissed a public-interest lawsuit demanding investigation of documents that appear to implicate dozens of officials in bribe-taking.


No one in my anecdotal experience believes that this guy completely shuns off any opposition, criticism or even slight difference of opinions

&gt;Even Mr Modi’s foes believe his administration is less corrupt than previous ones have been. However, as the banknote debacle revealed, it is not necessarily much more competent. The most iron-clad rule of Indian politics is anti-incumbency. Even the investors vying for Mr Modi’s attention may take note that, for all the talk of openness, India still has some of the world’s most tangled rules, highest corporate tax rates and most capricious officials.

Last week, it was brought to our notice that the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) had replaced the image of Mahatma Gandhi using the charkha in its calendar and diary, with that of the leader of the relatively free world, Narendra Modi, doing the same. The KVIC is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament and is tasked with promoting the use of khadi in the country. Mahatma Gandhi, as we all know, not only wore khadi (no monogrammed suits for him, even in cold England), he also wove khadi and promoted its use. The raised eyebrows at Mr Modi, quite the dapper suited and booted Prime Minister, not known for his khadi weaving skills, replacing Mahatma Gandhi in the calendar, is understandable.

But for every naysayer who keeps criticising our government, I would like to point that there is much reason to compliment the government and empathise with Mr Modi. As has been proven over the last couple of days, our government is a government of its word, its worthy men—and the rare woman—always work in tandem, and its responses are always consistent. Win-win-win.

First, it was announced in August 2016 that Modi would be replacing Aamir Khan as the brand ambassador of Incredible India. This, of course, had nothing to do with Khan’s statements about an air of intolerance in India. His contract was simply not extended and it was declared that there could be no better ambassador for India, than Modi. In fact, according to a report in The Indian Express, the ministry claimed that a marketing team study regarding the campaign had found that the number of foreign tourists from the countries which PM Modi had visited had gone up. “Even the number from US, where the Prime Minister has visited three times, has gone up by 8 per cent,” it said. the decision had been taken, based on these scientific findings.

And if Modi can be the face of Incredible India, why shouldn’t he be the face of Jio, Paytm and now Khadi?

Second, on 14 January, Modi addressed the 47th anniversary of Tamil magazine, Thuglaq. While complimenting the magazine’s founder Cho Ramaswamy, Modi said, “I think we need more satire and humour. Humour brings happiness in our lives. Humour is the best healer. The power of a smile or the power of laughter is more than the power of abuse or any other weapon,” he said. “Humour builds bridges instead of breaking them... And this is exactly what we require today. Building bridges, bridges between people, bridges between communities, bridges between societies.”

Sure enough, Haryana health minister Anil Vij took Mr Modi’s words to heart and rose to the occasion.

What else could explain his laughable comments on why Gandhi’s image was not being used in the calendar? Speaking to journalists in Ambala, Vij said, “Jab se khadi ke saath Gandhi ka naam judta raha, khadi uth hi nahi saki. Khadi doob gayi (Ever since Gandhi’s name has been associated with khadi, the industry has not been able to stand up. It has drowned). Mahatma Gandhi ka aisa naam hai, note ke upar chipak gaya jis din se, us din se note ki devaluation ho gayi (Gandhi’s name is such that from the day his image started appearing on currency notes, the currency note got devalued). It is a good move to replace Gandhi’s image with Modi. Modi is a better brand than Gandhi.” Vij added that khadi sales had risen by 14% after its association with Modi. (I assume this study was undertaken by the same people who studied the Incredible India campaign.) Commenting on the use of Gandhi’s image on the new currency notes, he said, “Gradually, he will be removed from the notes.”

Designer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Shaina N.C., not to be left out of the fray, said, “We don’t subscribe to anybody’s personal opinion. But the party is very clear that whether it is Gandhiji, khadi or the charkha, it is not a ‘soul proprietary’of any political party, organisation or ideology”. We must understand that khadi needs to be promoted and that is the intent of KVIC.

And sure enough, as quickly as you can say Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, Haryana chief minister M.L. Khattar stated that Vij had made the comments in his personal capacity. These were not the party’s views. BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma also said, “We condemn his remarks. Anyway he has withdrawn his remarks. Mahatma Gandhi is the father of our nation and our icon… The Congress doesn’t have the moral right to speak on Gandhi because it misused Gandhi’s name and looted the country.”

Vij retracted his comments by evening. “Mahatma Gandhi par diya bayan mera niji bayan hai. Kisi ki bhavna ko aahat na kare isliye main ise waapis leta hoon (My comment on Mahatma Gandhi is my personal opinion. I take it back so that nobody’s feelings are hurt).”

Third, and one which we were all awaiting, is that the government has now claimed that it had absolutely no clue that Narendra Modi’s image was being used by KVIC. The Prime Minister’s Office never sanctioned the use of the image. An “upset” PMO has supposedly sought an explanation from the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and has made its disapproval “clear”. How? That is not clear.

But Modiji ko gussa aya hai.

So, this makes it the third organisation or company to use Narendra Modi’s image on such a large scale for advertising. Only to be faced with an “upset” Modi. For everyone who compares Modi to Hitler, including Rahul Gandhi, shame on you. Because if Hitler’s image had been used without his permission in Nazi Germany, the owners of the company would have been packed off to the Kraków Ghetto and been made into soaps and lampshades.

So stop comparing him to Hitler. He’s a far better man.

Hitler was never shy of brand associations. And everyone from Hugo Boss who designed SS outfits to Volkswagen who was building a “cheap car” for Germans to Coke who created Fanta for the Nazis to Kodak who hired slave labourers from concentration camps and did business with the Nazi government or Siemens who made slave labourers from the holocaust construct the very gas chambers they would be gassed in were all working with Hitler and his government with Hitler’s blessings.

This is far from the case here. Here our own prime minister, a man not to be messed with, is being taken advantage of by various companies, including his own ministries. His image is being used without his consent or awareness. Instead of pillorying him, we should worry for him—and for ourselves. It’s tough enough to run a country without having to worry whether Harpic toilet cleaner or Manforce condoms will suddenly start carrying your face in their full-page ads in national newspapers. Also, if this can happen to Mr Modi, what hope do the rest of us common folk have against someone misusing our image for advertising or other reasons. But this is no time to think of ourselves.

This is the time for all of us to come together in support of Mr Modi and his exploitation by market and government forces. As Tammy Wynette said,

“Stand by your man,

And show the world you love him

Keep giving all the love you can

Stand by your man.”

“Do spin and spin after due deliberation… ‘Due deliberation’ means realization that charkha or act of spinning is the symbol of non-violence. Ponder; it will be self-evident.”

Was Modi giving that pose of spinning of Charkha to promote non-violence? The charkha in Gandhi’s hands stands for a lot more than the act of spinning. Modi acting it out for the cameras is a dangerous misappropriation.

&gt;* The median of 23 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists had predicted a 3.5 percent increase.

  NEW DELHI: In a bid to curb possible harassment of taxpayers during investigations into bank deposits post-demonetisation, the government is looking to lay down norms for tax officers, including a threshold below which scrutiny will not ordinarily be initiated.
  





  Even as estimates of cash deposits made by individuals are still being worked out, the tax department is analysing a mountain of data related to demonetised currency notes that were deposited in bank accounts between November 10 and December 30.
  





  Initially, the government said cash deposits of Rs 2-2.5 lakh made by housewives and small businessmen and traders would not be questioned. But amid largescale deposits by ""money mules"", it began analysing data for deposits of Rs 30,000 and above in case of Jan Dhan and dormant bank accounts that sprang to life November 10 onwards.
  





  As elections to five state assemblies near, with both BJP and the opposition making demonetisation a major issue, the government seems sensitive to the possibility of bad publicity resulting from honest deposits being questioned. It is a narrative that the party is keen to avoid.
  





  Tax authorities suspect that cash deposits amounting to as much as Rs 4 lakh crore may be unaccounted wealth that found its way into the banking system. Though data is being analysed and the focus is on high value, the government is wary of being accused of harassing the common man.
  





  ""Arbitrary action will anger public opinion that has largely supported demonetisation. We don't want an inspector to start proceedings,"" said a source, adding that investigations, particularly those below a specified limit, should be cleared by senior officers.
  





  A section within the government fears that the hunt for black money may result in giving undue discretion to tax officials, which should be avoided as it would expose NDA to the charge of ""tax terrorism"", a term PM Narendra Modi used for the UPA government during his 2014 campaign.
  





  In an interview, Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya had told TOI that there should be clear-cut rules to reduce discretion by tax officers. ""First, we could adopt a rule that barring exceptional circumstances, bank deposits made between November 8 and December 30 below a specified threshold will not be subject to scrutiny,"" he had said.
  





  Panagariya also said the government could adopt a rule that a certain proportion of taxable income during specified number of previous years would be treated as housewife's savings and deposits resulting from them would not be scrutinised. ""In other cases, we should run audits using data analytics instead of letting tax officers take a call. This would eliminate the interface between the taxpayer and tax officer and minimise scope for extracting bribes,"" he had suggested.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File Photo)

India has more ‘pro-poor’ political leaders than any other country. They have been very visible since the cash crisis hit us, competing raucously to prove that they are more ‘pro-poor’ than all the others. The Prime Minister noticed that his own credentials were being questioned and joined the competition instead of dismissing the ‘anti-poor’ charges flung his way as rubbish. In every speech he makes these days, he reminds us in thunderous tones that he did what he did for ‘the poor’.

The question we should all really be asking is why India remains one of the poorest countries in the world with such a profusion of leaders who love poor people. Could it be that the answer to this apparent conundrum is that Indian politicians have a vested interest in ensuring that poverty never disappears? Could it be that this vested interest was created from even before India gained independence from our colonial rulers?

Can we trace this passion for poverty to the Mahatma himself? It is usually unwise to find flaws in a political leader once he has become a Mahatma, but in seeking out the origins of poverty worship in our political class, I found myself dwelling on Gandhiji’s determined efforts to appear to be very poor. In those times it was perhaps a clever way to appeal to the vast majority of Indians who were indeed desperately poor. But, is the glorification of poverty useful any more? In imitation of the Mahatma, today’s political leaders continue to wear khadi, but have they noticed that most voters these days wear jeans? Have they noticed that those Indians who continue to be mired in poverty aspire only to escape it and become middle class?

The Prime Minister appears to have forgotten that the reason why aspirational young Indians gave him the first full majority in 30 years was because he promised prosperity instead of banging on like his opponents did about ‘the poor’. He also seems to have forgotten that he once told a gathering of investors in Washington that he saw no reason for India to continue to be a poor country. As a responsible political commentator, I feel duty bound to remind him why.

If millions of Indians live in horrendous poverty, it is because they have been deprived of the tools that would help them escape it. These tools are proper schools, decent healthcare and sanitary living conditions which thereby would give them an equal chance in the job market. Our ‘pro-poor’ political leaders have denied them these vital tools, choosing instead to throw scraps of charity (like MNREGA) in their direction. These schemes have served mostly to keep them in poverty. If the huge sums spent on this leaky and very expensive rural dole had been spent instead on improving our truly awful government schools and rural health centres, India would perhaps today be in a better position to end her shameful poverty.

Why is it that a Prime Minister who once publicly reviled MNREGA now embraces it with open arms? Has he discovered the benefits of glorifying poverty? Absurd though this may sound, there are huge benefits in keeping poverty alive. Very poor people ask no questions. Not even when they see their poverty-loving leaders strive to become very rich as soon as they enter public life. They see that elected officials who once could barely afford a bicycle start zooming around in convoys of foreign SUVs. They see them migrate from windowless hovels to splendid mansions. They see them mysteriously begin to live like millionaires. They see all these things but they rarely object because poverty deprives them of the energy to do much more than stay alive.

What your humble, poverty-hating columnist would like to remind our ‘pro-poor’ political leaders is that no country that glorified poverty ever grew rich and nor will India. The choice really is between investing in prosperity and investing in poverty. And it is very unfortunate that across India, in state after state, our chief ministers appear to see the benefits only of investment in poverty. It is a good investment and can often win elections because people who live below our pathetic poverty line are easily fooled by ‘pro-poor’ rhetoric. But India will only be rid of her poverty when we start investing in prosperity.

As long as political leaders wear their ‘pro-poor’ credentials as if they were badges of honour instead of badges of shame, we can be sure that India will remain a poor country. Of course, if the Prime Minister’s digital dreams are transformed magically into reality, it might make us the world’s only digitally enabled desperately poor country. The one benefit of digital dreaming is that electricity and the Internet will have to become much more reliable than they currently are in vast swathes of rural India.

Mumbai: India’s richest man isn’t done yet. After ploughing $25 billion into starting a national fourth-generation mobile network, billionaire Mukesh Ambani is spending more to boost coverage amid complaints from its largest rival that his free services are hurting competition.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a closely held unit of Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd, plans to raise Rs30,000 crore from a rights offer and will use the proceeds to enhance its network capacity, it said in an exchange filing Saturday. With freebies, Jio says it’s been luring 600,000 new users a day and had about 72.4 million subscribers four months after starting operations.

The fresh round of funding will help Jio challenge competitors with free-for-life voice calls and free data services through March. After Jio’s entry, Vodafone Group Plc, which runs the second-largest operator in India, said in November it would write down the value of its local unit. A national tribunal is set to hear a case 1 February, after Bharti Airtel Ltd. complained the freebies are killing the industry.

“Reliance clearly doesn’t want to be a small player, but wants to be No. 1, and to be No. 1, you need to invest lots of money,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “For sure, the other operators are struggling, but you need a disruptor to shake things up.”

Slashing tariffs

Ambani investment in Jio is part of Reliance’s plan to diversify from the oil and petrochemicals that comprised about 98% of profit last year. As part of the current fundraising, Jio plans to issue 6 billion, 9%, non-cumulative, optionally convertible preference shares of Rs10 each at a premium of Rs40. Reliance is set to announce last quarter’s earnings on Monday.

In response to Jio’s free services, Airtel, India’s largest carrier, and other operators have slashed tariffs by as much as 66%, and have increased data allowances to retain customers.

Airtel has accused the nation’s telecom regulator of turning a blind eye to Jio’s free service offer. In an affidavit filed at the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, Airtel said Jio’s free services were against the interests of the industry and will wipe out competition.

With Jio, Ambani is also betting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to push digital payments will spur more Indians to use its services in the world’s largest smartphone market after China.

After Modi banned 86% of the nation’s currency in circulation, digital payments have jumped almost 43% to 958 million transactions in December from November, according to the central bank’s latest data. India’s digital economy will grow to $1 trillion over the next 3 to 4 years, information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said last year.

“Having already made most of the investments in building out the network, Jio is probably spending this money on customer acquisition and some last-mile connectivity,” said Deven Choksey, managing director of Mumbai-based brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares &amp; Securities Pvt., said by phone. “They’re still capitalizing the company, as this is probably the first such startup in the world.” Bloomberg

The Narendra Modi government should show decisiveness of the kind that was on display over demonetisation to depoliticise and revamp regulatory bodies in higher education and research like the University Grants Commission (UGC), a noted scientist has said.

P. Balaram, a celebrated biochemist and educator and former Director of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), also dismissed as “meaningless” and “silly” the so-called efforts at the “saffronisation of science”.

“If you can do that (demonetise), I don’t see any difficulty in (taking action) in higher education and research. The most important thing is to immediately do something about the regulatory bodies in higher education, the UGC, AICTE and NAAC,” Balaram said.

A complete revamp and depoliticisation of the three crucial bodies was a must as there “needs to be some level of professionalism in education”, Balaram told IANS in an interview at the IISER-Kolkata campus here on the sidelines of the Advances in Life Sciences conference. The three-day event has been organised by the institute’s Biological Sciences Department.

(AICTE is the All-India Council for Technical Education; NAAC is the National Assessment and Accreditation Council.)

“Education also comes with the problem that it has a very large private component and so you need to look at private and public institutions separately,” suggested the 68-year-old scientist spent 43 years at IISc Bengaluru, including nine years helming the top-ranked institute.

Balaram dismissed claims of “saffronisation of science” under the Modi regime, days after the 104th edition of the Indian Science Congress drew flak for equating science with spirituality.

“I don’t take all that seriously. It’s good for the press. It’s good for the fringe. You can’t saffronise (science). It’s not going to happen,” he maintained.

“It’s meaningless. It is silly. After all, in the US there’s a big lobby for what is called creation science, they are creationists. Let them say whatever they are saying. How does that matter?” Balaram averred.

Observing the process of accreditation of institutions has become corrupt over the years, Balaram, a Distinguished Alumnus of IIT-Kanpur, blamed interference in the academic autonomy of establishments.

“If you want to accredit institutions you can’t have public and private institutions mixed together. The accreditation process over the years also has become very corrupt because of the mushrooming of colleges and this interference in academic autonomy of institutions,” he said.

Known for his incisive talks and writings, Balaram highlighted the differences in autonomy in administration and academics.

“In administrative functioning, you are taking money from the government, so you must follow certain rules for spending it and you must pay your people certain salaries; one doesn’t want autonomy in that at all. But academic autonomy is what courses you start, what courses have to be recognised and that I think the UGC interferes with,” he noted.

Batting for increasing the budget for higher education and research, the veteran scientist recommended the Department of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Human Resource Development work together.

A former member of the now-defunct National Knowledge Commission, Balaram gave high marks to the National Democratic Alliance government of Atal Behari Vajpayee (1998-2004) and the first United Progressive Alliance regime of Manmohan Singh for support to expand research.

“The period during which the maximum expansion took place was NDA1 and UPA1. From about 1998 till about 2008, that decade, I think, government was extremely positive. I would give both high marks for expansion as it is an important way for showing interest and showing it’s an important activity,” he said.

Dubbing as “worrying” the inaction in implementing reforms in the higher education sector, Balaram, known for his penchant for peptides and proteins, said the Modi government appears to be “somewhat disinterested in the area of higher education and research.

“It’s not high on its priority. That’s also understandable because the country has so many problems. But every country must have a certain emphasis on higher education and research and it’s also done by an active interest of ministers,” he emphasised.

Balaram did his Ph.D from Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, and underwent post-doctoral training at the Department of Chemistry in Harvard.

Likening the perception of rankings of institutions to a “beauty contest”, Balaram said figures should be harnessed for introspection and improvement and not for lamenting or chest-thumping.

As for the National Institutional Ranking Framework (launched by MHRD in 2015), he opined: “The national rankings could be used, if you have all your parameters correct, not to grade institutions but to decide the extent and kind of support. By support, I mean all kinds, not just financial but facilitatory and also boosting morale.”

In yet another hard-hitting speech, Congress Vice president Rahul Gandhi took on PM Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on their penchant for quoting the scriptures and invoking patriotism to put themselves on a pedestal. In fact, over the last few weeks, Rahul Gandhi has increasingly started using religious references to try and blast the wider Sangh Parivar over their acts of omission and commission. Apart from Narendra Modi, Rahul targetted the RSS and said, “For 52 years since India’s Independence, there was no ‘Tiranga’ (Indian flag) at the RSS HQ. They saluted the ‘bhagva jhanda’ and not the Tiranga.”

Addressing a rally in Rishikesh today Rahul said, “Jisne seene pe teen goli khai iss Tirange ke liye, unki photo Modi ji ne hata di” (The one who took three bullets on his chest, Modi Ji removed his image). Charkha is the blood and sweat of poor. One on hand Modi Ji takes photo with Charkha, but on the other he works for businessmen, he added further.

Reiterating the Congress symbol statement in during his speech, he said “Hath ka nishaan har dharm mein dikhayi deta hai” (Symbol of hand reflects in every religion). Further taking a dig at PM Modi’s outfit, he also said “I don’t care if my kurta/ pocket is torn, but Modiji’s clothes will never be torn.” He also asked the PM to take on call on the One Rank One Pension scheme. He said, “The way you took the decision of Demonitisation in a minute Modi Ji, you must also do the same for OROP.”

88,"**Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?**

[IMAGE](http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2017/01/16/Photos/Processed/modijaitley-kynB--621x414@LiveMint.jpg)

It is very likely that the Modi-Jaitley combine will accelerate the massive re-plumbing and rebalancing exercise between India and Bharat. Photo: HT

Every Union budget is shaped by the backdrop in which it is conceived; this year more so than others.

On the one hand, you have a fragile global economy with an unreliable US as its nucleus; domestically, India is still measuring the aftershocks of demonetisation even as corporate India continues to struggle with its funk, precluding new investments. On the other hand, this budget, to be presented on 1 February, comes just three days ahead of the latest round of elections, which includes the biggest prize—Uttar Pradesh. Clearly, the stakes are higher than normal.

So what will finance minister Arun Jaitley opt for in what will be his fourth budget? Good economics, good politics or the perfect score—a mix of both?

Whatever the answer, it will shape the remaining tenure of the government (which crossed its midpoint in December) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Any which way we look, this undoubtedly will be a defining budget; and this is the metric with which it will eventually be measured.

The first two budgets of Jaitley were panned by critics, pining for big-ticket reform commitments (like his predecessors were often wont to do, though never delivering on it—an example being the promise of rolling out the goods and services tax). The third budget, however, seemed to have drawn grudging praise; not sure how much of it was because it was well crafted/presented and how much because his critics finally got the message.

For this year’s budget to deliver the perfect score, it will have to address the obvious challenges facing the Indian economy—and this is not just about investment; it is essentially delivering jobs-friendly economic growth. It is very unlikely, as feared by those lobbying for its delay, that the budget will devote itself to addressing the coming elections through a burst of populist initiatives.

For one, it will be too little too late; Goa and Punjab vote three days after the budget is presented and the other three states will be in the throes of hyper campaigning—the noise from which will drown out benefits accruing from any complicated policy manoeuvres. In any case budget euphoria is always short-lived. Second, it will fly in the face of the defining ideology—empowerment over entitlement—of the Modi-led government. Third, Modi has so far demonstrated, as with demonetisation, his willingness to gamble his hard-earned social capital on unpopular decisions.

Instead, it is very likely that the Modi-Jaitley combine will accelerate the massive re-plumbing (demonetisation would be an example) and rebalancing exercise between India and Bharat (which some mistakenly view as robbing Peter to pay Paul and hence a redistribution of income). In that case, one can safely expect a fresh raft of measures to spur financial inclusion, the shift towards a digital economy, strengthening of the social safety net and so on. And if they are to stay true to their commitment to empowerment then expect several measures towards rebuilding Bharat, as defined by Mint’s budget tag line, ‘Rebuilding Bharat’. Bharat is still defined by agriculture (accounting for 48% employed) and the pathetic socio-economic statistics, something which cannot be fixed overnight—but a blueprint to fix the problem will be a welcome first step.

A boost to agriculture (which by the way is no longer just a foodgrain economy) will not only help alleviate the pressures of a prolonged period of rural distress but also be a short-term palliative. But more enduring will be steps ensuring development programmes survive the last mile and reach the intended beneficiary. The buzz is that the budget is likely to see a radical recast of public spending to fix this problem by introducing a social registry. The ecosystem today—largely because the 14th Finance Commission made states equal stakeholders—is far more receptive to this recast.

For the salaried middle class, no doubt bruised by demonetisation even while it was dealing with a post-boom economy, the FM would have something, just like corporate India can look forward to further ease of doing business and some tax relief. But in all likelihood the FM will finely balance these with other development measures to manage the optics to avoid being dubbed a “suit-boot sarkar” (a government for the rich); but then only to be accused by critics of being populist. You can’t win them all.

Clearly, content alone won’t matter; the crafting of the speech will be equally important. The suspense will be over in a little over two weeks from today.

On the topic of littering, I agree that it's the people's fault the country is dirty in the first place, and that it's our own responsibility to clean up. 

But from everything I've seen, the public is not willing to take any initiative, and the government could do a lot more to tackle littering. Here are some ideas of the top of my head.

1) Anti-littering laws and fines
2) Proper waste disposal system with proper maintenance of dustbins.
3) Compulsory (public hygiene?) classes in schools

But there are some things that are solely in the government's hands and the public is helpless in that manner. 

Do you agree that Swacch Bharat includes clean air and forest cover? 

The government has made environmental clearance for infrastructure projects near national parks way easier. The number of projects cleared has also increased. Environmental damage is not a price we should be willing to pay for business-friendliness.

I am not criticising Modi as an individual, but the government as a whole. There are obviously places where they could improve in terms of Swacch Bharat. We all want a cleaner nation, and that isn't going to happen without a 100% effort from the government. ",2017-01-16 20:32:05

This anyway started with the OP comment saying that 
""People like this, and not Modi"" (words to that effect). 

All I'm saying is, he's making an effort, which is already more than what the people before him did, and I do not see any negative in a campaign such as swach Bharat for there to be any criticism.

&gt;* Now that Modis initiative has weathered the social upheaval it created, forcing disgruntled citizens to wait in long lines to exchange their bills, its economic consequences are coming to light.

&gt;* More troubling for the prime minister, Indias most important economic indicator  its gross domestic product growth rate  is projected to fall for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31.

&gt;* By focusing on demonetization in the short term, Modi hopes to position himself as an anti-corruption candidate and boost his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of this years legislative elections.

&gt;* The tactic appears to have paid off: Last week, on Jan. 9, Shah announced that the BJP won 30 of 40 seats in local elections in Faridabad, a large city that borders the Indian capital of New Delhi.

He could decide not to present it to parliament. He could let the ordinance fail. Yet, he could secure the windfall for the RBI, and, ultimately, for his government.

&gt;**Jan. 02, 2017**: a tremor. The constitutional ground shook, then shifted. The supreme court, seven judges, guillotined the lax meanings and their libertine possibilities. Instead, they grafted a new, weaponised law of ordinances into place.

I wonder if the sly fox Jaitley will advice Modi to challenge this as the verdict was passed after the Demonetisation ordinance was already in effect? 

Is the SC verdict retrospective?",2017-01-16 23:00:21

These are important questions but these are also narrow in scope. That's not the whole point of politics. That's not, i believe, even the primary point. If BJP/Modi can deliver all the progress that this country needs then i don't have an issue with that and neither should anyone else have. It's never about a person or a party as long as the country gets what it deserves and needs.

But if we feel that there is something missing from our public life and if we have a message which needs to be heard then begins the political journey in all it's honesty. Indian nationalism barely existed when some people first started preaching it. Even an idea as uncontroversial as Indian independence took so many years to find home among Indian people, so many times it floundered and so many times it needed to be buttressed with other things to make it look more appealing.

This country is not even half built right now. Consider the main business of politics: law, order and justice. Are we even anywhere near where a country such as ours need to be? Are we happy with the progress we have made? Indian progressivism is thus not bereft of issues. It has legitimate and constructive role to play. But we can't expect an easy victory. Much less an electoral victory. That may very well happen as an unintended consequence but it shouldn't be our primary motive at all. The stakes are too high too. At stake is the fate of this country and the image in which it will be cast. The journey despite all it's struggles and perhaps because of it, is imo worth taking.

Source: Prem Nath Pandey

The BJP’s second lot of candidates for the February-March assembly polls prominently features fresh inductees from other parties, mainly in Uttarakhand, and relatives of these turncoats as well as of long-time BJP leaders.

After a CEC meeting attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah Monday, the party released the names of 149 candidates for Uttar Pradesh, seven more for Goa, 64 for Uttarakhand and completed its list for Punjab. “We have given tickets to candidates from all sections of the society and from all walks of life,” said Union minister J P Nadda, who released the list.

Watch What Else Is making News

The nomination of so many turncoats and relatives comes despite several statements against such a trend by top leaders including Modi. It could trigger disappointment among workers, said a party leader.

Uttarakhand

In the Uttarakhand list of 64 candidates — out of 70 —all the Congress rebels who joined the BJP in the last year or two have been rewarded, either with tickets themselves or with the nomination of close relatives. Nadda said all the sitting MLAs of the party, besides those who joined it from the Congress, have been given tickets.

Leader of last year’s Congress rebellion Vijay Bahuguna, a former chief minister, was rewarded with a ticket to his son, Saurabh, from Sitarganj. Ritu Khanduri Bhushan, daughter of former chief minister B C Khanduri, got the Yamkeshwar ticket.

The BJP even accommodated three leaders who had crossed over only Monday morning. Uttarakhand minister Yashpal Arya, who was considered close to CM Harish Rawat, sprang a surprise by quitting the Congress to join the BJP with his son Sanjeev and another Congress leader, Kedar Singh Rawat. All of them were given tickets within hours — in Bajpur, Nainital and Yamunotri respectively.

Yashpal Arya was the Dalit face of the Congress in the state. His son is making his poll debut, as are Ritu Khanduri Bhushan and Saurabh Bahuguna.

Former MP Satpal Maharaj, the first Congress leader to join the BJP in March 2014, has been given the ticket to Chaubattakhal.

The BJP has also moved some of the Congress rebels to other seats. Former Congress minister Harak Singh Rawat was transferred from Rudraprayag to Kotdwar.

Controversial BJP MLA from Mussoorie Ganesh Joshi, who had hit the horse Shaktiman leading to its death, was given the ticket from the same seat. Former state BJP president Teerath Singh Rawat and Vijay Brathwal were denied tickets.

Punjab &amp; Goa

The party dropped two ministers, Madan Mohan Mittal and Chuni Lal Bhagat, in Punjab while naming the last six candidates from that state. The party also denied tickets to two sitting legislators in Goa – Ramesh Tawadkar (Canacona constituency) and Anant Shet (Mayem).

Uttar Pradesh

Prominent in the UP list are BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma, former state unit chief Laxmikant Bajpai, and controversial MLAs Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana. The BJP has fielded the grandson of former CM and governor Kalyan Singh, Sandeep Singh, from Atrauli.

Former Congress leaders Ramesh Tomar, Congress candidate from Gautam Buddh Nagar in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls who moved to the BJP just 10 days before polling, and Dhirender Singh, who quit Congress and joined the BJP this month, have been fielded from Dholana and Jewar respectively.

The fielding of turncoats have upset some leaders. “The leadership should stick to what they have been saying. You cannot ignore those who worked for the party for years. The party is changing. The leaders say something and act differently,” said one woman leader from Uttar Pradesh who did not want to be identified as she is one of the aspirants.

Mukhtiar with the medal he gifts those who overcome addiction. Kamaldeep Singh Brar Mukhtiar with the medal he gifts those who overcome addiction. Kamaldeep Singh Brar

Kaffan vaala banda.

That’s the name people here have given to 46-year-old Mukhtiar Singh, an assistant lineman in the Punjab power department. The name stuck after Mukhtiar’s son Manjit Singh died last March. He marched on Patti’s streets carrying Manjit’s body, and sat on dharna with it outside the SDM’s office, wrote a letter on his son’s kaffan to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“I sought the Prime Minister’s intervention to save Punjab from drugs…I also wrote a complaint against the Punjab government because I hold this government guilty of not doing enough…These Akali leaders know it all, but yet they don’t do anything. I am not a politician. I am a father who has carried his young son’s body to the crematorium. I don’t want other fathers to go through the same pain,” Mukhtiar Singh said.

He doesn’t know if the shroud reached Modi. “I submitted it to the SDM office, who asked me to hand it over to DSP, Patti. Through RTI, I learnt that the shroud had reached the office of DGP (Intelligence) on June 28. I don’t know if they forwarded it to the PM or have dumped it somewhere,” Mukhtiar adds.

Manjit, who was 28 years old when he died, was a heroin addict. He died of an overdose, after two or three years of futile visits to rehab centres. Manjit was a college dropout and could not get any job. Since losing Manjit, Mukhtiar has taken it upon himself to educate the youth of Patti about the dangers of drug addiction. He has found some supporters in Patti. He calls their group Kaffan Bol Peya (Speaking Shroud).

For the February 4 Punjab Assembly election, Mukhtiar has written to the State Election Commission seeking its permission to campaign, not for a candidate or a political party, but against drug addiction. Election time is also when drugs are more freely available, he alleges. Mukhtiar’s wife wife Bhupinder Kaur and son Jagjit Singh, a graduate who is job hunting, are supporting him in his initiative against drugs. His daughter is married. “I took my son’s body around Patti because I wanted to show people what drugs can do to them. I wanted people to change their mindset and come out openly against this menace”, he said.

Mukhtiar’s day begins early. As part of his routine, he steps out of his home, meet people and ask them to join him in his crusade against drugs. “My 9 am to 5 pm job takes me to several villages throughout the day. I keep an eye for such youngsters who are addicts. I talk to people of that village, asking them to help such youngsters”, he said.

Patti, which used to be a tehsil of Lahore before Partition, now falls in Tarn Taran, a border district of Punjab known for its high number of drug addicts and NDPS cases. An Assembly constituency, Patti is represented by SAD candidate Adaish Pratap Singh Kairon, son-in-law of Punjab Chief Minister, Parkash Singh Badal.

Kairon defeated Congress candidate Harminder Singh Gill by a thin margin of 59 votes in 2012 assembly polls. They are locked in a triangular contest with AAP candidate Ranjit Singh Cheema. Both Congress and AAP have promised to end the drug menace in weeks and months.

Harminder Singh Gill, who is contesting on a Congress ticket from Patti, said, “A large number of youngsters have died due to drug overdose in Patti in the last 10 years. The police-politico nexus is facilitating the drug supply even at addicts’ doorsteps. Politicians’ close aides are into business of drug smuggling. There is story of death due to drug addiction in each and every street of Patti. Only opening de-addiction centres cannot cure drug addiction. The supply needs to be snapped. After coming to power, this shall be our top priority”.

Said Ranjit Singh Cheema, AAP candidate from the constituency who is making his debut in politics: “Curbing the drug menace is on our top priority, not only in Patti but across the state. There are many like Mukhtiar Singh who have lost their children to drugs. The supply chain needs to be snapped. Akalis and Congress, both had ruled this state in turns for decades. People have seen them and are now fed up of their false and hollow promises,” he says.

People in Patti say they have never seen sitting MLA Adaish Partap Singh Kairon after the last elections. And though he has been nominated to the same constituency by SAD, he is yet to visit this election. “He is an alien to this constituency who surfaces only during polls. Last time also he barely secured a victory by a thin margin. He won’t make it this time,” says Cheema.

Kairon was not available for comment despite several efforts to reach him. But the Shiromani Akali Dal has maintained that Opposition parties have blown the issue of drugs out of proportion and alleged this was being done with a view to defaming Punjab, and its youth. But this ramshackle rural-urban town close to the Pakistan border, is evidence that there is no wishing away the drug problem in the State.

At the Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) Centre, a Union government initiative on the premises of the Civil Hospital, addicts as young as 13 and 14 years queue up for their daily dose of drug substitute. Around 900 addicts are registered at the OST. Over 200 have been visiting the civil hospital regularly.

Opposite the OST, the Punjab government-run drug de-addiction centre used to have 120 patients in OPD per month. The number has declined over the last few months. One doctor visits the centre once a week, as she has to look after patients at Tarn Taran and Sarhali de-addiction centres on other days.

Dr. Isha Dhawan at drug de-addiction centre in Patti said, “On an average 120 patients come to OPD. Around 25 new patients come every month. We are trying our best to convince, educate and treat as many as we can. There are a few who are off drugs after treatment but yet there is a lot more that needs to be done”.

Aside from these two, there is a new drug rehabilitation centre in Bhagupur, a village in Patti tehsil. The town also has one government-sponsored NGO called Himalayan foundation, working to spread awareness about the dangers of getting HIV /AIDS from used syringes. Tarn Taran itself has the worst drug numbers for Punjab.

Mukhtiar Singh, who uses RTI to collect data relating to drugs, has all the information about the district.

“Tarn Taran district received maximum 83,873 addicts at the de-addiction centres out of a total of 2,91,367 addicts in 17 out of 22 districts of Punjab in 2014. Tarn Taran again topped the list in 2015 with 70,335 addicts enrolling in de-addiction centres among total 2,02,904 in the same 17 districts. The district also has a distinction with maximum of 4213 cases registered under NDPS act in last five years across the state. A total of 4,670 accused were arrested in those cases”, Mukhtiar Singh reels out from the replies he has obtained from the 17 out of 22 district administrations — Amritsar, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh and Faridkot did not reply to his queries.

Mukhtiar, who is also president of Technical Service Union of Bhikhiwind, a body of Punjab State Power Corporation employees, recently met Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal. “I gave him the figures on drug-addiction across Punjab. He quotes the same data in his speeches while addressing the drug issue in Punjab,” he says with pride.

But Mukhtiar adds in the same breath that he is not inclined towards any particular political party. “Some political parties have approached me to join them, but I said no,” he says.

Mukhtiar Singh maintains a file of cuttings on deaths due to drug addiction. “You would never know exact number of deaths due to drug addiction because people are ashamed to admit it,” he says. But he has been able to convince some people in Patti that talking about drug addiction is half the journey to winning the war against it. Tirath Ram, a juice vendor, says he is now facing the fact that both his sons are drug addicts.

“They may not live for long. That’s the reason I am not planning their marriage. I don’t want to spoil the life of any young girl by hiding this truth,” said Tirath Ram, with tears in his eyes. Attending to customers at his roadside vend, Tirath Singh says: “Drugs are easily available in this area. You just need to have money. Drugs will be provided at your doorstep. I attempted to get treatment for my sons. But I failed. No treatment can be successful until the drugs supply is cut.”

Repeating the widely leveled allegation of a nexus at the top levels between drug suppliers, law enforcers and politicians, he says: “Only government can stop supply but they themselves facilitate drug smugglers”.. Like Mukhtiar, Gurcharan Singh, a roadside tea vendor and resident of Bhagupur in Patti also lost his son last year. “Despite best of my efforts, I could not save him. Now, I am raising my grandson”. Mukhtiar, meanwhile, hopes the SEC will give him permission to campaign.

“There are rules barring government employees from canvassing or campaigning. But there can’t be a rule barring a father who lost his son to drugs from preventing other youngsters meeting the same ill fate,” he says.

140,"**Govt to integrate BHIM app with Aadhaar for transactions**

___



___

  NEW DELHI: Your Aadhaar card could soon become a universal payment ID. In a few weeks, the government will unveil a feature for payments through the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.  

 

  Transactions where Aadhaar is listed as a payment ID on the BHIM app will not require any biometric authentication or prior registration with the bank or Unified Payment Interface (UPI). This will make it more mainstream since almost one-third of India already has Aadhaar numbers, which have been linked to their bank accounts. UIDAI is currently working with banks and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and expects to roll out the feature in the “next few weeks.”  

 

  Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), told ETthat almost 38 crore people have already linked their bank accounts with Aadhaar and can receive payment directly from the UPI app without having to register first.  

 

  Though BHIM allows sending money to a mobile number, it requires the receiver to be registered with the UPI in order to accept payment. In turn, the long process of generating a UPI PIN by entering debit card details may discourage the poor and the illiterate.  

 

  “Through Aadhaar, any person — large service providers or independent ones such as plumbers or carpenters, irrespective of whether they are on BHIM or not — can get payments for their services directly into their bank accounts if it is linked to Aadhaar,” said Pandey. He added that almost two crore people are linking with accounts with Aadhaar every month and total figure for such accounts should go up to 50-60 crore — half the country —in the next two to three months.  

 

  Currently, there are five payment options on the BHIM app — namely mobile number, bank account or IFSC code, among others. Aadhaar number will be the sixth such option. “There are some teething troubles but we are working on strengthening security,” said Pandey.  

 

  Making Aadhaar a payment address is only part of the plan. It will also be possible to key in the Aadhaar number at a point-of-sale device and authenticate using biometrics. Pandey said this feature will be more useful for those making payments rather than receiving, such as shoppers. “A pilot is underway at fair price shops in Andhra Pradesh, where shopkeepers are accepting payments from PDS beneficiaries. The results are very encouraging,” Pandey had told ET earlier.  

 

  The process involving biometrics is complicated and could see failure due to weak fingerprints, biometric reader device malfunctions or even internet connectivity issues. On the other hand, integration with BHIM makes it a relatively hassle-free method. BHIM app for UPI, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, works on both feature as well as smartphones.

India features among top six for global executives when it comes to overall growth prospects over the next 12 months, but enthusiasm for investing in the country has dropped from three years ago, finds out a survey. (Reuters image)

India features among top six for global executives when it comes to overall growth prospects over the next 12 months, but enthusiasm for investing in the country has dropped from three years ago, finds out a survey. According to the annual global CEO survey of consultancy giant PwC, released here at the WEF annual meeting, the top two markets from the growth point of view are the US, as voted by 43 per cent of respondents, followed by China (33 per cent). Others in the pecking order are Germany (17 per cent), UK (15 per cent), Japan (8 per cent) and India (7 per cent). Last year, India was among the top five most promising markets globally.

“Over time, CEOs have become less enthusiastic about India perhaps because structural reforms have been slow to come (and there have been recent short-term difficulties with its rupee conversion programme),” the survey noted.

Watch this video

It further said “nevertheless, it still stands out for its robust growth and monetary and fiscal reforms”.

As per the findings, the changeability of markets, exacerbated by currency volatility, has caused CEOs to turn to a greater mix of countries. This year’s study shows that the US, Germany and the UK have become bigger priorities while willingness to invest in Brazil, India, Russia and Argentina has lessened from three years ago.

CEOs around the world feel they have plenty to worry about in the year ahead. Their confidence in companies’ growth prospects and outlook for the global economy are back on the rise.

Watch this video

Globally, 38 per cent of CEOs are very confident about their companies’ growth prospects in the next 12 months while 29 per cent believe that global economic growth will pick up in 2017.

While business leaders are more positive in their outlook, their levels of concern about economic uncertainty, over-regulation and availability of key skills remain very high.

Also, worries about protectionism are growing, with 59 per cent of CEOs concerned about protectionism, whereas the figure stands at 64 per cent in the United States and Mexico.

“Despite a tumultuous 2016, CEO confidence is moving back up – albeit slowly and still a long way from the levels we saw back in 2007. But there are signs of optimism right across the globe, including in the UK and US, where despite predictions of a Trump slump and a Brexit exit, CEOs’ confidence in their company’s growth are up from 2016,” said Bob Moritz, Global Chairman, PwC.

A significant 71 per cent of India’s CEOs are very confident of their companies’ growth in the next 12 months, a 7-point increase over last year’s and 33 points above this year’s global average (38 per cent).

“Confidence in the Indian economy is reflected in the optimism of Indian CEOs in their company’s growth. It re-instates India’s growth story, backed by the government’s reform agenda. Availability of key skills and disruption caused by technology continues to be a concern,” PwC India Chairman Shyamal Mukherjee said.

152,"From the article :

Like America’s president-elect, Donald Trump, who once claimed he could “shoot somebody” and not lose votes, Mr Modi’s support seems oddly unaffected by his flaws. 

Some pundits speak of “Modi magic” to explain his immunity from criticism, but there are more straightforward reasons. One is the prime minister’s talent as a politician. Although often dour in countenance, Mr Modi is a pithy speaker in Hindi, with an unerring nose for the class-driven grudges that often guide voter sentiment. 

Mr Modi is also lucky. His well-funded, highly disciplined and pan-Indian party faces an unusually divided and uninspiring opposition. Congress, a party that ran India for decades and still commands a nationwide base, is burdened by squabbling and corrupt local branches and a lack of clarity over ideology and the role of the Gandhi dynasty.

Other institutions, such as the press and the judiciary, are also not as vigilant as in other democracies. Some parts of the media are owned by Mr Modi’s friends and supporters; others by business groups with interests that are vulnerable to retribution. Journalists, whistle-blowers and activists are keenly aware that critics of the government often pay a price, whether in the form of “trolling” on the internet, harassment by officials or spurious lawsuits. 

Even Mr Modi’s foes believe his administration is less corrupt than previous ones have been. However, as the banknote debacle revealed, it is not necessarily much more competent.",2017-01-17 14:37:31
153,"Who will teach the government humility if not us?

We had a thread here back which said ""If elections were now, would you vote for Modi again"" and most people said ""Yes"" because most people have no idea how to use their vote to get what they want.

If we are all going to complain and then go and vote for them again because ""the competition is dumb"" then this is what we will get. Why should he be humble if all of you will still vote for him?

Politics takes work. If you don't like Modi and want opposition to be better, why don't you work for the opposition? Why don't you pick a party and start working for it? Why don't you start writing political speeches and articles? Why don't you start coming up with legislative ideas?",2017-01-17 15:22:39

&gt; * It also highlights how the Narendra Modi government, which before the 2014 elections promised to modernise Indias defence sector by making it more efficient and transparent, has struggled to formalise a method of probing corruption and convicting wrongdoers within the defence ministry.

&gt; * Senior defence ministry officials, when asked, insist that not all of the corruption complaints  especially those that have been lying dormant for over three years now  are of the large-scale, political-corruption variety that have marked Indias defence sector over the last 30years.

&gt; * The list of twenty pending complaints beforethe defence ministry is divided between complaints that have not been investigated for six months to one year, and above one year.

&gt; * Transparency International, while condemning the high rate of corruption in Indias defence sector in 2015, noted with approval some the new anti-corruption steps taken by Parrikars defence ministry.

You can blame them. Its a whole fucking country you have inherited for governance not some small business. Their policies really have an effect on the current government. They infrastructure spending has been looted throughout their regime. Most large scale projects have been kept delayed but investors need to pay their taxes and interest on the loans they have taken.   The NPAs have been created during UPA government but Modi and Rajan had to take the blame because of writing off their loans. Rajan himself admitted that governments used to interfere while sanctioning large loans. And Modi has least interfered in the loan structuring. There is a difference between willful defaulter and an actual defaulter. But no one considers this. Just blame the government for writing of loans as NPAs. You cant just jump on Vijay Mallya and take all of his property there are certain protocols to be followed. You cant make the list of NPAs public because it would be publicly shaming investors and project them as evil which in turn scares away the investors. So what should the government do without writing them as NPAs. So why should Modi take the blame because of NPAs created by UPA. I cant speak about every policy of UPA but it has been bad.

&gt;Even then, if you were to compare data, their performance was better than this governments. Forget job creation, Modi has practically destroyed hundreds of thousands. 

No. UPA was not the reason for jobs in India. Hell IT industry requires least investment by the government. IT industry was on a boom all over the world. India had the most preferred service based sector with our communication skills, technical skills and we are sadly a cheap labor. Infrastructure was a fucking joke in their regime. They were just on paper which would have taken years to complete. Things may not be visible but infrastructure projects are actually a bit better paced then what was back then. This government actually does not have IT sector boom considerably. They spend heavily on infrastructure. No massive scams have happened in infrastructure.

&gt;I would say, on all accounts, Modi's shortcomings overwhelmingly outnumber his achievements

No GST was a great achievement. You cant pull that off that easily. GST was opposed by Modi because Chidambaram wanted petrol,alcohol and almost everything under central government. Even Congress ruled states opposed it. But Chidambaram denied to revise the GST bill. This government made it possible. Call it being in majority it was easy but still mostly every state accepted it. PMJY is also an achievement. Giving DBT to all the people in the country and financial inclusion of poor even by force is fruitful if they learn the benefits over long term.",2017-01-17 18:52:47

  NEW DELHI: The middle class in both metro and semi-urban areas have big expectations from Budget 2017, especially after it had to bear a lot of difficulties due to demonetisation. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley can benefit the middle class in the Budget in several ways. These will not be mere handouts to please the middle class. Tax incentives to the middle class turn into savings, get invested and fuel growth.  

 

 Here are 10 things Jaitley can do in Budget 2017 for the middle class: 

 

 1. Raise minimum limit for taxable income 

  Currently, income above Rs 2.5 lakh is taxed. If the minimum limit is increased, it will not only benefit taxpayers at the bottom but also middle-class youth who are starting out as employees.  

 

 2. Restructure tax slabs 

  A restructuring of tax slabs will be a big balm for the urban middle class. Currently, 10 per cent tax is charged on annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, 20 per cent on Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and 30 per cent on income above Rs 10 lakh. The first two slabs can be widened or taxed at a lower rate.  

 

 3. Raise exemption limit on allowances 

  Salaried employees enjoy exemption from tax on several allowances/benefits that the employer provides such as children's education, conveyance, medical reimbursement, house rent and leave travel. The allowance limits were fixed a long time ago and need to be revised in view of inflation.  

 

 4. Increase deduction under Section 80C 

  Currently, deduction under Section 80C of the Income-tax Act is allowed from Rs 150,000 to Rs 300,000. If Jaitley increases the limit, he can boost household savings which can ultimately get invested and power growth.  

 

 5. Raise exemption limit for senior citizens 

  The existing exemption limit of Rs 300,000 for senior citizens (60 years to less than 80 years) and Rs 500,000 for super senior citizens (80 years and above) could be enhanced to Rs 400,000 and Rs 650,000 respectively.  

 

 6. Bring back deduction on infrastructure bonds 

  The government may reintroduce deduction of Rs 20,000 or actual amount invested, whichever is lower, for investments made in infrastructure bonds. This will also boost spending, spur growth and create more jobs.  

 

 7. Offer more incentives for NPS investment 

  Jaitley can offer more incentives for taxpayers to invest in the National Pension System (NPS). He can increase the deduction under Section 80CCD (1B) to Rs 100,000 from the existing Rs 50,000. He can also being NPS on par with the Employees Provident Fund or Public Provident Fund with respect to exemption of 100 per cent of the accumulated balance on withdrawal, subject to certain conditions.  

 

 8. Offer interest subvention on home loans 

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already offered interest subvention of 3 per cent and 4 per cent for loans of up to Rs 12 lakh and Rs 9 lakh, respectively, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. However, these subventions are targeted at buyers in Tier 3 cities. Budget 2017 has scope of offering interest subvention on larger amounts of loan which will benefit buyers in big cities and other urban areas.  

 

 9. Allow higher deduction on home loan EMIs 

  Currently, the deduction available on interest on home loan is up to Rs 2,00,000. The deduction can be claimed on the principal repayment for up to Rs 1.50 lakh. There is a large scope in both cases to raise the deduction limits.  

 

 10. Allow early deduction on home loan EMIs 

  Deduction for interest on home loan is currently available only after the buyer gets the possession of the property. This means the benefit begins several years after the buyer gets the home loan and begins paying the EMIs. This deduction can be given right from the payment of the first EMI.

International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook update slashing India’s growth prospects for 2016 by one percentage point has provided the Congress party and other Modi-baiters with another opportunity to attack the NDA government in Centre. In a series of tweets following the release of IMF report on Monday, the Congress claimed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had already warned of a slump in the economy in the beginning of demonetisation exercise announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016.

“Dr. Manmohan Singh warned against the drop in the beginning of demonetization. The ego of an individual has pushed billion ppl into trouble!,” the Indian National Congress tweeted. The party even accused Modi government of pushing India backwards on the line of government in Pakistan.

Overview of World Economic Outlook projections.

However, the party appears to have not read the details of the report in depth. As the party has already used IMF report to attack the government, here’s something that may force Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and other opposition leaders to recalibrate their strategy against Modi.

Dr. Manmohan Singh warned against the drop in the beginning of demonetization. The ego of an individual has pushed billion ppl into trouble! http://t.co/kO6RJaZN2Q — INC India (@INCIndia) January 16, 2017

Owing to “the temporary negative consumption shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions associated with the recent currency note withdrawal and exchange initiative, the IMF has slashed India’s forecast for 2016 from 7.6 to 6.6%. The forecast for 2017 has also been slightly reduced by 0.4%.

However, despite the “negative” IMF forecast for 2016 and 2017, as claimed by the critics of demonetisation, India would continue to grow faster than China in 2017 and 2018 by huge margins. For the year 2016, IMF has estimated growth in China to be at 6.7%, which is just 0.1% higher than India’s 6.6.

You May Also Like To Watch This

If the forecast is to be believed, Indian economy would take a big leap in the next two years. In 2017, India would grow at 7.2% and at 7.7% in 2018. In contrast, China would grow at 6.5% and 6.0% in the respective years.

ALSO READ I Demonetisation dilemma: Should you trust NaMo or MaMo?

The possibility of India growing more than the IMF forecast is also high. The report has mentioned that current trimming of India’s growth forecast is because of the “negative consumption”. However, with so much money available with banks after demonetisation and expected sops to be announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the upcoming Union Budget 2017, consumption pattern may grow faster than what have been estimated by the IMF for the forecast. Earlier, World Bank had also predicted healthy growth of Indian Economy in the years 2017 and 2018.

The next General Elections are scheduled for 2019. In the words of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, PM Modi would be “riding an elephant” if IMF forecast becomes true.

203,"**Yet to enrol for Aadhaar? Hurry, it could soon become a universal payment ID**

___



___

  NEW DELHI: Your Aadhaar card could soon become a universal payment ID. In a few weeks, the government will unveil a feature for payments through the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app by simply entering the 12-digit Aadhaar number.  

 

  Transactions where Aadhaar is listed as a payment ID on the BHIM app will not require any biometric authentication or prior registration with the bank or Unified Payment Interface (UPI). This will make it more mainstream since almost one-third of India already has Aadhaar numbers, which have been linked to their bank accounts. UIDAI is currently working with banks and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and expects to roll out the feature in the “next few weeks.”  

 

  Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), told ETthat almost 38 crore people have already linked their bank accounts with Aadhaar and can receive payment directly from the UPI app without having to register first.  

 

  Though BHIM allows sending money to a mobile number, it requires the receiver to be registered with the UPI in order to accept payment. In turn, the long process of generating a UPI PIN by entering debit card details may discourage the poor and the illiterate.  

 

  “Through Aadhaar, any person — large service providers or independent ones such as plumbers or carpenters, irrespective of whether they are on BHIM or not — can get payments for their services directly into their bank accounts if it is linked to Aadhaar,” said Pandey. He added that almost two crore people are linking with accounts with Aadhaar every month and total figure for such accounts should go up to 50-60 crore — half the country —in the next two to three months.  

 

  Currently, there are five payment options on the BHIM app — namely mobile number, bank account or IFSC code, among others. Aadhaar number will be the sixth such option. “There are some teething troubles but we are working on strengthening security,” said Pandey.  

 

  Making Aadhaar a payment address is only part of the plan. It will also be possible to key in the Aadhaar number at a point-of-sale device and authenticate using biometrics. Pandey said this feature will be more useful for those making payments rather than receiving, such as shoppers. “A pilot is underway at fair price shops in Andhra Pradesh, where shopkeepers are accepting payments from PDS beneficiaries. The results are very encouraging,” Pandey had told ET earlier.  

 

  The process involving biometrics is complicated and could see failure due to weak fingerprints, biometric reader device malfunctions or even internet connectivity issues. On the other hand, integration with BHIM makes it a relatively hassle-free method. BHIM app for UPI, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, works on both feature as well as smartphones.

I never said that UPA is responsible for no jobs under NDA but UPA doesn't deserve credit for IT industry boom which was the major sector where jobs were created.

NDA is very much responsible for unemployment. But consider these facts too..
1.They were able to create low level jobs that too in infrastructure as many projects have began work recently. Civil engineers are getting jobs.But not mechanical engineers thanks to lack of investment.
2.Food parks which were on paper during UPA were sanctioned under NDA which will produce 5lakh jobs in two years.
3. Mudra Yojana gave loans of 1.5 lakh crore according to RBI. Many more small loans to small industries at lower interest rates possible with enough liquidity in banks. These will not go into NPAs as they were enough security checks.These things don't come under employment but they sure must count.
4.But jobs don't come out of thin air. Software sector did not get jobs in Modi regime. So who stole these jobs in the world which are due to us. No one. The software industry had stopped producing jobs at the rate at which it is used to. Even at the end of UPA-II job growth slowed down.
5. Manufacturing industry can boom. But we lack the supply chain logistics which China has which will take years to develop. Solar panels are cheaper in China because of this and paying even lower wages.But IIP is still rising.
6.MNREGA scheme. Its populist scheme. Its bad. But something for employment. Atleast freebies. 
7.Metro rail projects and rail projects will grow in future. Which will create employment. 
8. CAMPA scheme: 40000cr money released under afforestation scheme to create new jobs.
9.Banking and Financing. Financial Inclusion will create more jobs in finance sector just wait and watch next five years.
10.Telecom: BBNL.It connects all gram panchayats to fibre but sadly progress has been very slow. Then private players come into play to provide internet. As India will be connected whole new Industry will kick in.

Its the mere frustration of engineers like me and other youth in India.
Trust me I am a fresher. I am sitting with no job in Hyderabad. I have GATE score of 82. 
I don't love this government. But I was learning about our system as you can see I am unemployed.I keep in touch with all economic activity in India. 
I want to be a programmer.Sadly this industry has slow down and may never recover thanks to automation. It would be even more difficult to retain these jobs again thanks to automation. I am sad at the state of affairs in this country due to overpopulation. This is what India as whole is heading towards.No government can save anyone in the world.

  The value of transactions on USSD -- mobile short code message used mainly for banking services on feature phones -- during the same period grew 4,061 per cent to Rs 46 crore on December 25, from the earlier Rs 1 crore a day.
  





  UPI transaction -- which allows users to transfer funds from one bank account to another using a smartphone -- grew 1,342 per cent to 53,648 a day on December 25. This stood at 3,721 on November 8.
  





  In value terms, it grew 647 per cent to Rs 14 crore a day, from Rs 1.93 crore earlier.
  





  For good measure, on December 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled an indigenous digital payment app BHIM for fast and secure cashless transactions on mobiles.
  





  BHIM is a payment platform designed to make UPI and USSD payment modes simpler and usable across feature phones and smartphones.

&gt; * In the many critiques of Prime Minister Narendra Modis mode of political functioning, one of the knee-jerk characterisations has been to call him a fascist.

&gt; * The latest usurping of history has been in the replacement of Mahatma Gandhi by Modi in the Khadi and Village Industries Commission calendar for this year.

&gt; * Modis monarchical frame of all history  past, present and future  being a record of his life and achievements has three distinct elements to it.

&gt; * Finally, there is the question of what might be termed teleology: that idea that all history was leading towards the coming of Modi.

&gt;* International Monetary Funds latest World Economic Outlook update slashing Indias growth prospects for 2016 by one percentage point has provided the Congress party and other Modi-baiters with another opportunity to attack the NDA government in Centre.

&gt;* As the party has already used IMF report to attack the government, heres something that may force Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and other opposition leaders to recalibrate their strategy against Modi.

&gt;* Owing to the temporary negative consumption shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions associated with the recent currency note withdrawal and exchange initiative, the IMF has slashed Indias forecast for 2016 from 7.6 to 6.6%.

&gt;* However, despite the negative IMF forecast for 2016 and 2017, as claimed by the critics of demonetisation, India would continue to grow faster than China in 2017 and 2018 by huge margins.

&gt;* However, with so much money available with banks after demonetisation and expected sops to be announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the upcoming Union Budget 2017, consumption pattern may grow faster than what have been estimated by the IMF for the forecast.

___

[IMAGE](http://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2017/Jan/fv_1484652448_800x420.jpg)

___

On November 8, 2016, the world came crashing down for many when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his demonetisation move. Over two months later, even as the nation limps towards some semblance of normalcy, there are those who remain relegated to the margins of the digital payment world, for whom e-wallets and ATM cards are an entirely alien concept.

Of these, perhaps the most wretched are commercial sex workers — the stigma of their profession barring them from the education and awareness required to use alternatives to cash.

In a bid to bring these workers into the cashless arena, a group of civil service aspirants from the city decided to take this learning to the sex workers at Budhwar Peth and make them aware of their options.

BCCL

A basic survey was carried out last week, following which a group of 13 civil service aspirants started working with sex workers on Saturday.

Said Swapnil Sanap, who has a BSc in computer science and is preparing for civil services, “I had read about various workshops which organisations, banks and the government had organised on going cashless. It got me thinking about people from red light areas, carrying the apparent taint of their profession and thus forced to remain uninformed. I figured that the only way was to go and meet them ourselves and help them.”

Simple as the solution seemed, Sanap found few takers for his plan. “Some of my close friends and I contacted around 200 civil service aspirants. Most of them were reluctant to work in a red light area. In the end, only 13 of them agreed,” he said ruefully.

Representational Image



Satish Thakare, another civil services aspirant, pointed out, “Preparing for civil services is so much more than just reading books. Working with different sections of society is such an essential part of learning. We surveyed an entire area and found out that most sex workers from Bangladesh and Nepal do not have bank accounts while those from India have accounts, but no ATM or debit cards.”

Sujit Bhasme, an engineer and civil service aspirant, said, “Mingling with the sex workers was not easy. They are wary of accepting any kind of assistance and didn’t really want to talk to us. Finally, we contacted some activists working in the area and with their help, started our work.”

BCCL



The group wanted to focus on government schemes targeted towards creating a cashless economy such as *99\# — the USSD code for mobile banking services and the RuPay card launched by the National Payment Corporation of India, along with ATM and debit cards and e-banking facilities offered by nationalised banks. The group also met bank officials, made notes, prepared PowerPoint presentations and went to different houses in the area with their computers. An NGO, Kayakalpa, working in the area, also made their hall available to the group for presentations.

The sex workers seemed more than happy to receive this education. One of them said, “Last month, my father was admitted to a hospital in Sangli. After the demonetisation move, as banks were hugely crowded, I had to wait for two days before I could deposit money. Had I known all these things, I would have been able to use my options.”

Another sex worker from the area, said, “I have noted down the mobile numbers of these students. My daughter is 16 years old. It is difficult for me to comprehend this information, but I will ask my daughter to call the students and get an ATM card and RuPay Card for us.”

BCCL

The students are aware that their efforts may bear fruit only for a small number of people. But, they say, change has to begin somewhere.

“We will continue to spread awareness, share our mobile numbers and even accompany them to the banks if they want our help there. We’re not claiming that we will be able to make an entire area cashless, but at least awareness will be created. If even 10 commercial sex workers start using the cashless system, it would be worth it,” Sanap concluded.

Last month, my father was in hospital. Had I known all these things, I would have been able to use my options, rather than waiting for two days in crowded banks to deposit cash

From schools to universities, all educational institutions in Madhya Pradesh will have to prominently display pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Swami Vivekananda.

They will face disciplinary action if they defy the latest diktat from the BJP-led government.

Higher education minister Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya ordered institutions and offices to put pictures of five personalities on their premises — Prime Minister Modi, President Pranab Mukherjee, Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda and Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, the architect of India’s Constitution.

The school and higher education departments accordingly sent circulars.

“The minister has made it compulsory to display portraits in all government colleges, universities and offices. There are strict instructions for action against officers disobeying the order,” said Ashish Upadhyaya, the higher education principal secretary.

The Opposition criticised the move, saying it was done under pressure from the RSS, the BJP’s ideological fountain. The RSS has been accused of meddling with government affairs, especially policies on education.

“They are promoting Swami Vivekananda as his ideology suits the RSS,” state Congress spokesperson KK Mishra said.

“In educational institutions, they should display portraits of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Jawaharlal Nehru, who gave new direction to independent India, and great scientist APJ Abdul Kalam.”

Social activists too questioned the logic behind the compulsory display of portraits, especially of Swami Vivekananda, a Hindu monk and religious philosopher.

“If they want to inspire and motivate students, they should include Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Savitribai Phulle who contributed a lot to education. Why Swami Vivekananda?” wondered child rights campaigner Prashant Dubey.

A notice on January 7 stated that the portraits can be obtained from information and broadcasting ministry’s photo department in New Delhi.

The school education department referred to a letter from January 2004, released during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s rule, to make purchases from the ministry mandatory.

This has put principals of upcountry schools in a fix.

“The portraits can be purchased from a nearby market, but the department has unnecessarily increased our burden. The portrait costs Rs 200, excluding delivery charges. We are trying to get them to save our job,” said the principal of a government middle school, who didn’t wish to be named.

This protest has been going on for days but just few hours back, govt agreed to make a discussion. Until then, they were ""treated"" only by police.

So dont fucking talk as if police is for keeping law and order, that too TN police.

  NEW DELHI: The railways has decided to rope in private companies to redevelop and modernise 23 stations, including the iconic Howrah station, Mumbai Central and Chennai Central.  

 

  The first private sector-driven redevelopment plan at Habibganj (near Bhopal) is expected to be flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi shortly, paving the way for seeking participation for the other 22 projects, most of them British-era facilities.  

 

 Bansal Construction will redevelop Habibganj station at Rs 400 crore, spending Rs 100 crore for redeveloping the main station and the rest for creating secondary facilities.  

 

  Apart from the 23, contracts for redevelopment of at least two stations in Delhi, Anand Vihar and Bijwasan, are expected to be finalised by March, sources told TOI. Faridabad in the National Capital Region is also on the modernization list.  

 

  While the government had cleared a plan to redevelop 44 stations last January, not much progress has taken place on the ground with the development of Gandhinagar having been kicked off earlier this month. But the development is not driven by the private sector and is instead through a special purpose vehicle with equity from the railways and the Gujarat government. With the railways moving slowly on getting private players, the state and the central government stepped in.  

 

  But now, officers said, things have been firmed up with the Boston Consulting Group conducting feasibility study for 55 stations and 23 are ready for award. The maximum number of projects are expected to be in Mumbai where apart from Mumbai Central, Bandra, Borivali, Lokmanya Tilak in Kurla and Thane, which was the terminus for the first ever train in the country — are on the list.  

 

  Sources said the cost of redevelopment is expected to be around Rs 4,000 crore and the government will earn at least Rs 4,000 crore as upfront fee from the developers which bag the rights. Apart from modernising the railway station, the developer will also get the rights to develop surplus land near the station, including building of hotels and other facilities. The lease will be for 45 years.  

 

  The overall investment is estimated to be in the region of Rs 25,000 crore, a source said.

New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to significantly increase public investment in infrastructure in Union Budget 2017, offering fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth at a time when private investment shows no signs of a pick-up.

There is near unanimity that the economy needs to be spurred through higher public investment, unlike last year when there was a significant divergence of opinion over the need for fiscal stimulus, said an official with knowledge of the thinking within the government. The official requested anonymity.

Last year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.

“Different schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive consolidation and for boosting growth. I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets,” Jaitley said in his budget speech last year.

ALSO READ | Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

This year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.

Investment demand in the economy is expected to contract in 2016-17 by 0.2% from 3.9% growth in 2015-16, according to data released by the government’s statistics department earlier this month.

The investment scenario further worsened after 8 November when the government invalidated high-value currency notes. Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE) data released earlier this month showed a sharp fall in new investment proposals in the October-December quarter to Rs1.25 trillion, compared with an average of Rs2.36 trillion worth of new investments seen per quarter in the preceding nine quarters that the Narendra Modi government has been in power.

Clearly, investors have been spooked.

D.K. Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India, said the economy needs a “substantial fiscal stimulus” to revive growth, which had started slowing even before demonetization. “Government can revise upward its fiscal deficit target for next fiscal to 3.5% of GDP from 3% of GDP under the existing fiscal consolidation roadmap. Beyond that it can allow states to borrow more for capital investments.”

ALSO READ | Should the budget stray from straight and narrow path of fiscal consolidation?

The government may be helped by the recommendations of a committee set up under former secretary in the finance ministry and Bharatiya Janata Party member N.K. Singh to suggest a new roadmap for fiscal consolidation. The committee, which was appointed in May last year, was asked by the finance ministry to examine the need and feasibility of aligning fiscal expansion or contraction with credit contraction or expansion, respectively, in the economy. It has also been asked to examine the feasibility a “fiscal deficit range” . The committee is expected to submit its report on Thursday.

The government official cited earlier said one of the key reasons behind advancing the budget presentation by a month is to give more time to key infrastructure departments such as railways, highways and urban development to implement larger projects as more funds will be made available to them.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month told economists at the NITI Aayog that advancing the date of presentation of the Union budget will help speed up investment expenditure in the productive pre-monsoon months.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government may be facing the opposition hurdle in Rajya Sabha in enacting certain new laws, but its record of getting obsolete and redundant laws out of the statute book appears to be moving ahead without too much fuss.Successive governments had repealed 1,301 such outdated laws in 64 years.

&gt; * But the present government has managed to weed out as many as 1,159 obsolete laws in less than two years.Obviously, the opposition-dominated Upper House too had played its part when it passed those bills concerning repeal of the 1,159 central laws, including two dozen of them from the British era, that had lost relevance long ago due to enactment of other related laws, incorporating provisions of the earlier Acts, over the years.RS had passed two such bills, repealing 1,053 Acts, during the recently concluded Budget session.

&gt; * While the passing of one  Appropriation Acts (Repeal) Bill 2015  could repeal 758 old appropriation acts, the other one  Repealing and Amending (Third) Bill, 2015  could weed out the other 295 Acts.Laws on licence to kill and capture of wild elephants in certain circumstances, segregation and medical treatment of lepers, regulating the grant of titles to qualified persons in western medical science, prohibition of pledging of labour of children (child slavery), regulating recruitments of foreigners during pre-Independence period, agreement with Pakistan on exchange of prisoners, continuation of use of courts in Bengal, Assam and Punjab for those who migrated to Pakistan and power to regulate prices of newspapers are among others Acts which have been repealed.There had been many more laws in the statute books which had been of no use as provisions of most of the old Acts had already been incorporated in new legislations.

Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani, who is attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) meet at Davos, Switzerland came out strongly in favour of the free market system. (AFP)

Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani, who is attending the World Economic Forum (WEF) meet at Davos, Switzerland today came out strongly in favour of the free market system and highlighted the crucial need to keep it functioning without any extraneous factors to ensure wealth gets distributed equitable across the world and through all the strata of society. Ambani today said, “Creation of wealth shouldn’t be constrained as it is precursor to distribution of wealth.” He added that he favours a mostly ‘free market economy’.

Considering that the note ban drive in India grabbed eye-balls across the world, Ambani pointedly highlighted its success. He said, “Demonetisation proves India is ready for 4th industrial revolution, especially today with a strong leader in Narendra Modi.”

You May Also Like To Watch This:

Ambani went on to indicate the road that India needs to take for the future welfare of its people and underlined the importance of technology in that difficult and mammoth endeavour. He said, “India needs to really transform its education system and technology can be the best facilitator for that.”

Highlighting the importance of strong leadership at the governmental level, Ambani said, “At this time we are blessed with a very strong leadership with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We are a very young country and education needs to transform itself and technology is the best way for that”.

How that would all be brought together was explained by Ambani when he said, “For all of this you need a foundation and you need a country and a society to embrace technology. All the components of technology and in particular fourth industrial revolution technology, they are all inclusive”.

He also indicated that the biggest problem for al is building wealth, but once that is achieved, inclusiveness can be easily achieved.. He said, “Distribution of wealth is a much easier problem once you have created it, so you should not constrain creation of wealth.

Reacting to questions about the year gone by and his prognosis for 2017, Ambani said last year was all about “understanding technology of fourth industrial revolution and this year it would be about implementing that. The challenge would be to understand the basic needs of the people and implementing the new technologies rightly.”

He added, “In last 90 days, we have had a major movement of digital cash and less cash and people have supported it because they feel it is good for their future. All of us live in a society and a company must do something for the society’s good. This was something which we decided to do after interactions here at Davos and within our own company. We must learn to build inclusive technology for everyone and create access in the future”.

Mukesh Ambani is leading this technology charge with his new telecom venture Reliance Jio, which he kickstarted with a sector-disruptive free data internet plan for the masses that has forced other companies in the segment to scramble to cut rates to retain their customers. Reliance Jio customer base has reached 72.4 million by 31 December, 2016. It has recently extended its free offer to March. According to the company it is adding lakhs of new customers daily, but it is not committing to achieve the 100 mn target by March, which was set by Ambani himself when he launched the company in September 2016.

  India’s richest man isn’t done yet. After plowing $25 billion into starting a national fourth-generation mobile network, billionaire Mukesh Ambani is spending more to boost coverage amid complaints from its largest rival that his free services are hurting competition.  

 

 Reliance Jio Infocomm, a closely held unit of Ambani’s Reliance Industries, plans to raise $4.4 billion from a rights offer and will use the proceeds to enhance its network capacity, it said in an exchange filing Saturday. With freebies, Jio says it’s been luring 600,000 new users a day and had about 72.4 million subscribers four months after starting operations.  

 

  The fresh round of funding will help Jio challenge competitors with free-for-life voice calls and free data services through March.  

 

  After Jio’s entry, Vodafone Group, which runs the second-largest operator in India, said in November it would write down the value of its local unit. A national tribunal is set to hear a case February 1, after Bharti Airtel complained the freebies are killing the industry.  

 

  “Reliance clearly doesn’t want to be a small player, but wants to be No. 1, and to be No. 1, you need to invest lots of money,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.  

 

  “For sure, the other operators are struggling, but you need a disruptor to shake things up.”  

 

 Slashing tariffs 

  Ambani investment in Jio is part of Reliance’s plan to diversify from the oil and petrochemicals that comprised about 98 percent of profit last year. As part of the current fundraising, Jio plans to issue 6 billion, 9 percent, non-cumulative, optionally convertible preference shares of 10 rupees each at a premium of 40 rupees. Reliance is set to announce last quarter’s earnings on Monday.  

 

  In response to Jio’s free services, Airtel, India’s largest carrier, and other operators have slashed tariffs by as much as 66 percent, and have increased data allowances to retain customers.  

 

  Airtel has accused the nation’s telecom regulator of turning a blind eye to Jio’s free service offer. In an affidavit filed at the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, Airtel said Jio’s free services were against the interests of the industry and will wipe out competition.  

 

  With Jio, Ambani is also betting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to push digital payments will spur more Indians to use its services in the world’s largest smartphone market after China.  

 

  After Modi banned 86 percent of the nation’s currency in circulation, digital payments have jumped almost 43 percent to 958 million transactions in December from November, according to the central bank’s latest data. India’s digital economy will grow to $1 trillion over the next 3 to 4 years, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said last year.  

 

  “Having already made most of the investments in building out the network, Jio is probably spending this money on customer acquisition and some last-mile connectivity,” said Deven Choksey, managing director of Mumbai-based brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares &amp; Securities Pvt., said by phone. “They’re still capitalizing the company, as this is probably the first such startup in the world.”

270,"**In intermediate to longer term, India represents extraordinarily good opportunity: Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs**

  In an exclusive interview with Tanvir Gill of ET Now , Abby Joseph Cohen , PresidentGMI ( Global Markets Institute)  , Goldman Sachs , says in 2017-2018 what will emerge will be an India that seems to have a greater transparency in terms of what is happening in the economy.

 

 Edited excerpts 

 

 

 We have to talk about emerging markets and India in specific. We have a budget coming up in early February at a time when governments across the world are stepping up on spending to push investment. What are the three factors that will draw more interest from global investors to India within emerging markets through 2017? Goldman Sachs believes India holds promise from a policy making perspective, explain that. 

 

  That is a very interesting point that you raised. Clearly, my colleagues who focus on the emerging markets believe that on an intermediate to longer term basis. India represents extraordinarily good opportunity.  

 

  Some of this has to do with things that are not looking so good now getting much better. So for example, in forthcoming years, we do expect that there will be within the what is called the legal sphere, a less bureaucratic entanglement the court reforms are helpful, accounting reforms are helpful and so on.  

 

  Secondly, in a world in which labour force growth has slowed dramatically and in some countries including emerging economies such as China -- it is funny to refer to it, world’s second largest economy is an emerging economy -- there is no labour force growth or population is actually shrinking as it is in Japan and in some places in Europe.  

 

  India does really standout in that regard. Now long term economic growth is related to a host of factors but very importantly growth in the labour force is critical. We also think there will be an improvement in the literacy rate in India. So my colleagues remain quite optimistic about India. We see an equilibrium growth rate, let us call it in a range of 7-8% contrast that to 1% for Europe, 2-2.5% for the United states. That represents attractive opportunity.  

 

  In the short term, many non-Indian investors are looking at the demonetisation effort with great interest. It is something that most of us are not familiar with because it has not happened all that frequently in world economic history but the data thus far suggests that things are going about as planned and we think in 2017-2018 what will emerge will be an India that seems to have a greater transparency in terms of what is happening in the economy and this is just one of the several reforms that have been discussed by Mr Modi.  

 

 How do you look at the monetary policy action in emerging markets responding to the monetary policy stance taken by some of the developed world economies starting off with the United States as they move towards policy normalisation? Can EMs continue to be accommodative if the Fed turns hawkish and that is followed by the ECB using the exit towards accommodative monetary policy and the Bank of Japan following suit? 

 

  Let us keep in mind that what happens in the United States may be unsynchronised with what happens elsewhere. The United States economy has grown faster and for longer than others. Capacity utilisation rates in factories and in our labour markets are far different than they are in Europe. For example, our unemployment rate is closer to 4.5% as opposed to the 9.5% that we see throughout much of Europe.  

 

  So the rise in interest rates that we expect in the United States is something that I would not describe as a contractionary but rather less stimulative than it was previously because we are coming from interest rates that the vice chair of our Federal Reserve has referred to as very, very low and with the rise in rates we have seen they are still very low. We do not think they will impede economic activity and we do not think that it will afflict the United States in its role as a very significant importer of goods from other nations.  

 

 As a broad theme 2017 is seen more advantage United States, disadvantage emerging markets, is that your view as well? 

 

  I think it is so important to recognise that while it is easy to say emerging markets and assume that the average EMs tells you something, it really does not. There are such extraordinary differences between the various economies, you know, we spoke a little bit about India and what we see in India is dramatically different from what we see in East Asia and what we see in Latin America and so on.  

 

  And so number one, we need to look at each economy and each market separately. Number two, even if I break my first rule I do think that emerging markets can have a reasonably good year if the United States has a reasonable good year. If the world’s largest importer continues to grow, if Europe enjoys a somewhat average 2017, this is good news for many of the emerging markets but we have to be careful to separate them in terms of those that grow because they are commodity producers, those that grow because they have significant cost advantages in manufacturing and others that benefit because of where they are located geographically.  

 

  There are so many disparities between emerging markets that I hesitate to discuss them all as one large group other than to say that if investors are not risk averse, if investors globally are willing to take on risk by looking at areas of economic growth, then emerging economies and emerging markets should do well.

271,What would demonetisation failure look like? People taking up arms in the streets? Demonetisation was brutally forced upon the citizens and they had no choice but to accept it. And that is the reason why it is improper for Modi to thank the citizens for supporting demonisation. What else could they have done? It's like thanking somebody for making love to you after you finish raping them. It's disgusting to pretend that people took this on willingly.

The world needs India's sustained rise as much as needs the world, Prime Minister Modi said on Tuesday but warned ""parochial and protectionist attitudes"" are threatening globalisation goals and ""non-state actors"" are stoking instability, violence and extremism.

He also pitched for a new ""open and inclusive"" security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region and asked to abandon terrorism if it wanted dialogue with India.

Modi also said that the relations between and are witnessing expansion across the spectrum.

""India's transformation is not separated from its external context. Our economic growth, employment opportunities for our youth, our access to capital, technology, markets and resources and security of our nation are all deeply impacted by developments in the world. But, the reverse is also true. The world needs India's sustained rise as much as needs the world,"" Modi said while inaugurating the Second Raisina Dialogue, India's flagship geo-political conference.

Noting that self interest alone is ""neither in our culture nor in our behaviour"", he said that India's economic and political rise represents a ""regional and global opportunity of great significance"".

""Our actions and aspirations, capacities and human capital, democracy and demography, and strength and success will continue to be an anchor for all round regional and global progress,"" Modi said.

Attacking over its support to extremism, Modi said that alone cannot walk the path of peace and that must reciprocate the sentiment in letter and spirit.

""A thriving well-connected and integrated neighbourhood is my dream... My vision for our neighbourhood puts premium on peaceful and harmonious ties with entire South Asia. That vision had led me to invite leaders of all SAARC nations, including Pakistan, for my swearing in. For this vision, I had also travelled to Lahore.

""But, alone cannot walk the path of peace. It also has to be Pakistan's journey to make. must walk away from terror if it wants to walk towards dialogue with India,"" he added.

The Prime Minister pointed out that has redefined, despite uncertainty and conflict, partnerships with Gulf and West Asia, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Iran.

Vis-a-vis China, MOdi said it was ""not unnatural"" for two large neighbouring powers to have ""some differences"".

""In our engagement with China, as President Xi and I agreed, we have sought to tap the vast area of commercial and business opportunities in the relationship. I see the development of and as an unprecedented opportunity, for our two countries and for the whole world,"" Modi said.

The Prime Minister said that over the past two and a half years, his government has given a strong momentum to India's engagement with the US, Russia, Japan and other major global powers.

""These partnerships are a good fit with India's economic priorities of capital and capacities, commerce and technology, industry and infrastructure, skills and development, and defence and security,"" he said.

On the US, he said he and President-elect Donald Trump have ""agreed to keep building on these gains in our strategic partnership"".

Modi noted that the world's multi-polarity, and an increasingly multi-polar Asia, is ""a dominant fact today"", and welcomes it but with ""vibrant pools of progress"", rising ambition and festering rivalries are generating ""visible stress points"" and sought a ""transparent, balanced and inclusive"" security architecture.

""The steady increase in military power, resources and wealth in the Asia-Pacific has raised the stakes for its security. Therefore, the security architecture in the region must be open, transparent, balanced and inclusive. And, promote dialogue and predictable behaviour rooted in international norms and respect for sovereignty,"" he said.

He said that in its march of progress, the world will find ""a beacon of peace and progress, stability and success, and access and accommodation"".

Organised by think-tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in collaboration with India's External Affairs Ministry, the Raisina Dialogue seeks to examine ""the prospects and opportunities for Asian integration as well as Asia's integration with the larger world"".

Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper were also present among the audience.

287,"India recently announced that it will welcome the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since 1959, at an international conference on Buddhism in the state of Bihar in March. Ignoring protests from the Chinese government, India will also allow the Dalai Lama to visit the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as part of its own territory and calls South Tibet. This represents a gradual but significant change in India’s Tibet policy, and it flows directly from China’s refusal to acknowledge India’s security concerns.

When Narendra Modi took office in 2014, his government hesitated to openly acknowledge official interactions with the Dalai Lama, ceding some ground to Chinese sensitivities. But by last month, President Pranab Mukherjee was hosting the Dalai Lama at a summit held in his official residence, the first meeting in decades between a serving Indian president and the Tibetan leader.

China reacted strongly to this meeting, saying New Delhi was disrespecting one of Beijing’s core interests. New Delhi retorted that the Dalai Lama was a revered spiritual leader and it was a nonpolitical event. China has also objected to the planned visit by the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh, saying it would damage bilateral ties.

Behind all this are broader strategic disagreements, including the “technical hold” placed by China on India’s attempt at the United Nations to designate Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a terrorist. Beijing has blocked India’s move for nearly a year despite support from all other members of the 15-nation Security Council.

After India recently tested long-range ballistic missiles, China indicated it would be willing to help Pakistan increase the range of its nuclear missiles. When the Obama administration asserted that Beijing was an “outlier” in refusing to back India’s membership in the multinational Nuclear Suppliers Group, China replied that “membership shall not be some kind of farewell gift for countries to give to each other.” Meanwhile China is pursuing its $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that traverses the disputed territory of Kashmir, implicitly acknowledging Pakistan’s claims there.

Still, India remains wary of upping the ante on the Tibet issue, which dates to the British Raj. The origins of the Sino-Indian war of 1962, in which India was defeated, can be traced to the asylum provided to the Dalai Lama after China’s annexation of Tibet. China’s repressive policies in the Tibet Autonomous Region have kept the Tibet question unresolved all these years. China portrays the Dalai Lama as a separatist “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and fumes at India for keeping him as an honored guest.

China has been relentless in seeking the Dalai Lama’s global isolation. After he visited predominantly Buddhist Mongolia in November, China closed a key border crossing with Mongolia and imposed new tariffs on commodity shipments. Mongolia, desperate to enhance economic ties in critical areas such as mining and infrastructure, apologized to Beijing and promised that the Dalai Lama would no longer be allowed to visit.

New Delhi seems to recognize that sacrificing the interests of the Tibetan people hasn’t yielded India any benefits, nor has there been tranquillity in the Himalayas for the past several decades. As early as 2010, New Delhi stopped referring to Tibet as part of China in joint statements with Beijing. As China’s aggressiveness grows, Indian leaders find themselves with fewer levers to affect Chinese behavior, so further supporting the legitimate rights of the Tibetan people could be an attempt to set new terms of engagement with Beijing.

This dovetails with the Modi government’s broader interest in promoting Buddhism as a means to cultivate ties with neighbors and express India’s ancient heritage. The prime minister himself has visited the Indian city of Bodh Gaya, the birthplace of Buddhism.

It remains to be seen how far the Modi government will go in challenging China on one of its core interests. But the recent evolution in India’s Tibet policy underscores that as China becomes stronger and more aggressive in pursuit of its interests, it should be ready for pushback from regional states that view its growing might with dread. Chinese hegemony will not come easy.",2017-01-18 13:57:25

RBI governor Urjit Patel should release all the data about how many old bills have been returned, and explain why it took so long for him to do so. Photo: Reuters

The Indian government’s abrupt decision to withdraw high-value notes from circulation has hurt a great many people and sectors of the economy. But the institution that’s been injured the most is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Since demonetisation was announced on 8 November, India’s austere and technocratic central bank has become the butt of online jokes. Soft-spoken governor Urjit Patel has endured intrusive protests. The central bank employees’ union wrote him a letter saying staff were “humiliated” by the RBI’s “operational mismanagement” and warning that the bank’s “autonomy and image have been dented beyond repair.” One former RBI governor said that in Patel’s position, he would resign.

Patel is clearly feeling the heat: Last week, he “literally started running” out the back door of an auditorium in order to avoid a phalanx of reporters. But he should have one and only one concern now: to rebuild trust in the central bank’s competence and independence as quickly as possible.

As the union’s letter noted, the RBI’s implementation of the demonetisation policy has gravely damaged such faith. Even the program’s strongest supporters generally agree that its rollout has been bungled. For many Indians, this incompetence has been captured most visibly by the RBI’s endless and sometimes contradictory orders to banks, which have kept both banks and ordinary citizens in a state of perpetual confusion. At some point, most people stopped counting the number of new RBI decrees (the opposition Congress party claims to have recorded at least 126 changes in just a few weeks).

Other wounds have been equally self-inflicted. The bank, for instance, suddenly stopped issuing weekly data on how much money was being returned when opponents of demonetisation pointed out that the proportion was much larger than expected. Even previously-released data mysteriously vanished from the RBI website. Various officials leaked different estimates of the returns, all of which sounded awfully high. So the RBI was forced into an official denial, saying it was “still counting” the number of notes returned.

Patel has yet to answer far too many questions about the conception and planning of demonetisation. When was the idea broached? How long was it planned? Was the RBI’s board given enough time to consider it? (It looks like it was given just a few hours.) What were the RBI’s assumptions about money supply and velocity when it took the decision, and why have these gone wrong? Was the decision unanimous?

A well-functioning central bank would have released much of this information by now. But not only has the RBI not done so, the bank is stonewalling freedom of information requests, citing national security. Little wonder that it’s being seen in some quarters as a rubber stamp for the central government.

It’s important to remember that the law that governs India’s central bank doesn’t actually allow for true independence; its Raj-era authors wanted to ensure that the then-colony’s monetary policy would continue to be drafted in Whitehall. Independent India adopted that logic in toto, as it did with other colonial legal codes. The section on monetary management in the RBI’s governing statute still begins by granting blanket powers to the government: “The Central Government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest.”

Building up, extending and preserving the RBI’s autonomy has been a difficult and sometimes delicate task, pursued over decades by successive governors. Most had to stand up to government bullying at some point. Thanks to their work, India’s bank now has a reputation as an inflation-fighter and as a competent regulator. This keeps inflation low, and lends interest rates a stability that helps attract investment.

However difficult the task, repairing this reputation is critical—particularly at a time when Indian private sector investment is slumping. Patel must swiftly demonstrate that he is his own man. One good place to start: The RBI governor should release all the data about how many old bills have been returned, and explain why it took so long for him to do so. Next, he should lay out a timetable for when replacement currency notes will reach the market, as well as a description of the level at which the RBI expects money supply will eventually stabilize.

Sure, transparent and credible data will likely reveal that demonetisation has been a foolhardy exercise in pointlessness. But Patel’s job is to protect the RBI’s reputation, not the government’s. He’d be wise to start acting like it. Bloomberg

NEW DELHI: The government won't offer any special concessions to Apple but is reviewing its entire policy on mobile phone manufacturing as part of an effort to promote the 'Make in India' initiative, officials said. This could meet some of the demands that Apple has made apart from benefitting other phone makers as well.Apple had sought the concessions to set up plants in the country. The issue will be examined in depth at a high-level meeting with Apple executives next week. On Apple's wish list is said to be a 15-year customs duty holiday on the import of iPhone kits, new and used capital equipment, and consumables. Apple's requests are being considered by three government departments — revenue, industry and information technology.India needs to support an iconic brand like Apple for the success of the Make in India campaign, officials said. ""Our import duty is high,"" one of them said. ""As long as they are getting into exports, our objective should be to give them lowest duty so as to ensure that their product is competitive. Hence we may even relook at the policy as a whole."" Another official said no decision had been taken but that concessions cannot be given to just one company. ""Normally, similar dispensation has to be given to others similarly placed,"" he said.The Make in India programme is aimed at encouraging investment in manufacturing to drive job creation in the country and thereby boost growth and raise incomes to lift people out of poverty.Apple had earlier sought permission to set up fully owned retail outlets by forgoing the compulsory 30% local sourcing rule on the ground that it was bringing cutting-edge technology to India. The finance ministry didn't allow the exemption.Explaining the rationale behind a fresh look at the trade policy, the first official said India cannot be isolated from the rest of the world. ""India has to follow same set of principles prevalent elsewhere which has helped players to become global manufacturers,"" the official said.In its application submitted to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion under the commerce ministry, Apple has sought full duty exemption on manufacturing and repair inputs (raw materials), yield loss on inputs, components, capital equipment (including parts), and consumables for smartphone manufacturing and services/repair for a period of 15 years for both domestic and export markets. Currently, 12% duty is levied on fully imported phones while 12.5% countervailing duty is charged on the import of mobile phone equipment, discouraging global manufacturers from setting up production bases in India.Apple is betting big on the India market where it currently holds a market share of just 2% as growth slows in developed markets like the US and China.Apple's products are manufactured in six countries — mostly in China but also in South Korea, Japan and the US.As many as 42 companies make mobile phones in India, including Chinese firms Huawei and Xiaomi . No other company has approached the government for any incentives, people with knowledge of the matter said.During his visit to the country last year, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook had said India was the next big market for the company. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged Cook to set up factories in India when they met during that trip.

On top of that, he added: ""Mera pocket/kurta phata ho toh mujhe farak nahi padta, lekin Modi Ji ka kapda kabhi nahi phata hoga aur vo gareeb ki rajneeti karte hain.""

""My kurta pocket is torn, and that doesn't matter to me. But you will never see Modiji wearing torn clothes, despite the fact that he claims to represent the poor and plays politics with the poor,"" is what Rahul said.





No one needed reminding thatRahul recently returned from vacation+- a short one, albeit one he took abroad. As well, he's the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family, which goes back a long way in history, and is unlikely to be found wanting for a new kurta. Rahul's'suit boot ki sarkar' jibe+did him good and it appears he needs to keep his clothing-poverty analogies to a minimum for them to really have an effect.



Or the Twitterati will lay into him like it did with his torn-kurta comment.

  NEW DELHI: Amid the row over her educational qualification, Union Minister Smriti Irani had asked the Delhi University not to disclose it to an RTI applicant, the School of Open Learning has told the Central Information Commission.
  





  The Commission has now directed the School of Open Learning (SoL) to produce before it all the records related to educational details of Irani, Union Textile Minister.
  





  A fresh show cause notice has been issued to the Central Public Information Officer of DU for having failed to produce the records before the Commission as directed.
  





  Irani's degrees have been caught in a row after a petitioner alleged she had given contradictory information in her affidavits filed before contesting elections in 2004, 2011 and 2014.
  





  In her affidavit for April, 2004 Lok Sabha polls, Irani had said she completed her BA in 1996 from DU (School of Correspondence as SoL was then called), whereas in another affidavit of July 11, 2011 to contest Rajya Sabha election from Gujarat, she said her highest educational qualification was B.Com Part I, a petitioner had alleged in a city court.
  





  The matter was dismissed by the court on the ground that considerable time had lapsed in filing the complaint.
  





  The issue is, however, still alive before the Central Information Commission where an applicant had filed an appeal, saying he was not given information about Irani's educational qualification by the SoL.
  





  During a hearing, SoL's Central Public Information Officer O P Tanwar said considering that it was a third party information he had consulted Irani about the disclosure.
  





  ""In her response (she) raised objection against (sic) disclosure and requested the public authority not to reveal her educational qualification. The CPIO pleaded that information sought was given by the former HRD Minister in fiduciary capacity and hence could not be divulged as per Section 8(1)(e),"" Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said in his order.
  





  Although Chief Information Commissioner R K Mathur has divested Acharyulu of the Human Resource Development Ministry portfolio, two days after he ordered disclosure of records of the degree course of BA, 1978, the year in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is said to have passed from Delhi University, he will continue to adjudicate matters in which he has already issued notices and is finalising orders.

___

New Delhi: While RBI Governor Urjit Patel testified for a parliamentary committee today on how the sudden notes ban was planned and implemented, former Prime Minister Dr Mamnohan Singh quickly intervened to help him on a tricky matter.



 
Dr Singh, who served as the top boss of the central bank before his terms as Finance and Prime Minister, advised Mr Patel not to reply to questions which could create problems for the central bank, whose autonomy, according to critics, has been depleted by its role in the demonetization drive.  
  
  



Show Full Article

 
Sources on the Standing Committee of Finance, which had summoned Mr Patel today, said that in particular, Dr Singh jettisoned a question raised by Digvijaya Singh, an MP from his party, the Congress, about whether ""chaos"" would break out if the existing restrictions on cash withdrawals are removed. ""You should not reply to that query,"" Dr Singh counselled.



Yesterday, the RBI announced that the daily limit for pulling out cash from ATMs has been raised from Rs 4,500 per day to Rs 10,000. However, no more than Rs 24,000 per week can be withdrawn per savings account.



 
On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would be illegal within a few hours, a move aimed at unearthing black money and fighting tax evasion and corruption. The sudden announcement created a huge cash shortage with 86% of the notes in circulation suddenly declared abolished. Mr Patel today refused to provide any figure for how many of the banned notes had been deposited into the banking system and he did not provide clarity on when the cash situation would become normal.



 
In November, Dr Singh tore into PM Modi in a speech in parliament, calling his move an ""organized loot and legalized plunder"" of the country. He also said demonetization will cost the GDP two percentage points, describing that as ""an underestimate and not an overestimate.""Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelated$135 Billion Of New Notes Injected, RBI Governor Urjit Patel Tells MPsMore StoriesSeething Over Jallikattu Ban, Thousands Refuse To Leave Chennai's Marina BeachThousands Protest Across Tamil Nadu In Support Of Jallikattu$135 Billion Of New Notes Injected, RBI Governor Urjit Patel Tells MPs

&gt; * BENGALURU: India's economy lost momentum in the final three months of 2016 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's ban on high-value notes hurt consumption and businesses but it is set to pick up this quarter, a Reuters poll found.Having posted growth of above 7 per cent for six consecutive quarters, India's gross domestic product is expected to have expanded just 6.5 per cent in the October-December quarter - the weakest in nearly three years.The poll also suggested growth would remain below 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2017, at 6.9 per cent.India's GDP for the fiscal year to March 2017 is expected to grow 6.9 per cent, according to the poll of over 20 economists.

&gt; * That is higher than the International Monetary Fund's estimate of 6.6 per cent.

&gt; * ""If the demonetisation exercise has led to some permanent supply-side disruptions, growth could be weaker for longer,"" wrote Pranjul Bhandari , chief economist for India at HSBC, in a note.The November 8 announcement of the ban on high-value notes, which coincided with Donald Trump's US Presidential election victory, has caused major disruptions in the cash-reliant economy.Industrial and services output have been hobbled, with a survey earlier this month showing private sector activity contracted in December.

&gt; * ""Lower growth for at least two quarters means that the output gap will take longer to close, suggesting that the revival of the investment cycle, which is already very weak, could be pushed out even further,"" added Bhandari.Still, a majority of economists answering a separate question said they were confident or somewhat confident the government's demonetisation drive would boost consumption and investment in the longer-term.A slight majority, nine of 15 economists, said the initial aim of removing unaccounted money from the system will not be achieved.

In a vitriolic attack, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday compared the fallout of demonetisation on the Indian economy with the disaster wreaked by the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.



""By dropping the 'atom bomb of demonetisation', Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reduced the Indian economy to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 'All are dead',"" the Sena said in an edit in party mouthpieces Saamana and Dopahar Ka Saamana.



Accusing Modi of ""not heeding anybody"", the Sena said the Prime Minister did not listen to the advice of even the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) before spiking Rs 500 and 1,000 notes on November 8 last year.



""Just like the deaf-and-dumb parrots sitting in his Cabinet, (Urjit Patel) was appointed the RBI Governor and the country's economy has been reduced to shambles,"" the Sena noted.



The party led by Uddhav Thackeray is an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the Centre and Maharashtra.



Recalling Modi's recent statement in Baramati (Pune) that he seeks advice from the elder statesman, Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar, the Sena countered saying even he (Pawar) is now strongly critical of the move.



Initially, Pawar backed demonetisation but gradually he has become very critical of the move as it has struck the country's masses, poor farmers and the economy.



""Pawar is saying that 'initially it appeared that demonetisation was good, but it failed to bring out the black money'. This is because the 'black money' is stashed abroad and hence could not be brought out,"" the edit reasoned.



However, it was the Indian economy and the rural cooperative economy which bore the brunt of the notes spike, including state and district cooperative banks and financial institutions or even the sugar cooperatives.



""The farmers depended on district and rural cooperative banking sector for carrying out their daily trade in agriculture produce and depositing their incomes. But demonetisation has declared it (their incomes) as 'black money' as the state and district banks were barred from exchanging old Rs 500 and 1,000 notes,"" the edit pointed out.



It rued that the government spread canards terming these cooperative banks as the ""hotbed of corruption"", which is an insult to the entire cooperative sector.



""The fact is that people like Vijay Mallya committed scams in the nationalised banks, not in the cooperatives. How many times we must scream this at the government?"" the Sena asked.



""If Modi is truly taking Pawar's advice, then Pawar must have definitely advised him not to perform the funeral of the farmers by labelling cooperative banks as corrupt, since the cooperative sector is the soul of the Maharashtra economy,"" said the edit.



Even Pawar has acknowledged that over two months post-demonetisation, the Indian economy continues to be in tatters, the edit said.



""At least 50 per cent industries have been hit hard, 35 per cent employment has been affected, unemployment has shot up especially in rural areas and nobody is bothered about the common masses whose backbone has been crushed,"" it added.



The edit cited a recent Assocham study saying over four million people have lost their jobs so far and the situation will worsen in the coming days.



""The people are completely demoralised by the move and we are very concerned about the country's future. So we are expressing our deepest anguish,"" the edit concluded.

UBI is the only way out or there will be mass conflict. We've already seen the early stirrings of this in the Jat agitations and other castes who have traditionally not been seen as worse off(Marathis are another group). They all want reservations. Problem is that public jobs are *declining*, and have been for some time. 

Now add the drug abuse in Punjab spreading to other states, together with mass joblessness even as the top 10% in the country is fine and doing better than ever. Now tell me: what kind of parties and/or leaders do you think will be voted in? Modi is a politician. If he senses that the vote is in bashing the top 10%, he will go there. 

If he doesn't, someone else will. But this is probably going to occur in the post-2020 period. ",2017-01-18 22:36:27

NEW DELHI: Cracking hard on bureaucracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi government sacked a senior IAS officer on grounds of non-performance. In a similar action, union home ministry on Tuesday sacked two senior IPS officers for alleged non-performance.

Mayank Sheel Chohan, a 1998 batch AGMUT cadre officer, and Raj Kumar Dewangan, a 1992 batch Chhattisgarh cadre IPS officer, have also been given premature retirement under the same service rules.

Modi government is conducting a performance review of IAS officers working with central government departments in order to check dead wood. It has also asked state governments to carry out the similar exercise.

K Narasimha, a 1991 batch IAS officer of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union Territories (AGMUT) cadre, was served with a 'premature retirement' order without any notice.

The Appointments Committee of Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the decision under Rule 16 (3) of All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules-1958 and allowed him to get three months pay and allowances in lieu of notice.

Official sources claimed that Narsimha has been sacked for alleged non-performance and also due to corruption charges against him following a departmental review of the officer's service allegedly found him unfit for the job.

The CBI has filed a case against Narasimha for allegedly possessing assets more than his known sources of income. The allegations against the officer included misuse of official position while working as Secretary, Sports Authority of India, earlier.

Earlier in 2014, graft-tainted IAS couple in Madhya Pradesh, Arvind and Tinoo Joshi, were dismissed from service, four years after an income-tax search on their house led to the detection of disproportionate assets worth Rs 350 crore and recovery of Rs three crore cash.

NEW DELHI: The Centre appears to be sympathetic to the demand ofTamil NaduonJallikattu, but it will wait for theSupreme Court's final order on the bull-taming sport before taking its next call on the controversial issue.



Since the matter is still pending as the apex court had last week reserved its verdict on petitions challenging Centre's 2016 notification allowing the sport, the environment minister Anil Madhav Dave did not want to comment on the issue at this juncture on Wednesday.



Sources in his ministry, however, said that the Centre would have, in any case, an option to take Parliament route if the apex court insists on banning Jallikattu in its final verdict.



Dave had last week blamed the previous UPA government for the current mess. He had on January 11 tweeted, ""The mother of problem is the Congress-led UPA government which included bulls in performing list in 2011"".



He had also tweeted that the matter was pending in the Supreme Court and the government was waiting for the decision.



Meanwhile, officials in his ministry are waiting for the outcome of the Tamil Nadu chief ministerO Panneerselvam's meeting with Prime Minister+Narendra Modi. The state chief minister will meet Modi on Thursday, seeking an ordinance allowing Jallikattu.



The apext court had on last Thursday rejected a plea seeking to allow the controversial sport played during Pongal festival in Tamil Nadu and reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging Centre's notification allowing the sport.



The Centre had in January last year issued a notification lifting ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu with certain restrictions. It was, however, challenged in the Supreme Court by Animal Welfare Board of India, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals+(PETA) India, a Bangalore-based NGO and others.



The court had in 2014 banned Jallikattu on grounds of animal cruelty. It had on January 21 last year refused to re-examine its 2014 judgement. Later on July 26 last year, it had said that just because the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu was a centuries-old tradition, it could not be justified.

The expert committee led by Lieutenant General (retd.) D.B. Shekatkar has recently submitted its report to the Defence Minister. The committee, composed mostly of retired senior military officers, was appointed in May 2016 and was tasked with looking at “Enhancing Combat Capability and Rebalancing Defence Expenditure”. Among its many recommendations is the appointment of a single-point military adviser to the Defence Minister. Since Manohar Parrikar has already spoken of his desire to move in this direction, the recommendations of the Shekatkar committee assume greater importance.

The committee has reportedly recommended the new post should be a four-star appointment – equivalent to those of the service chiefs. This top four-star officer is envisaged as a coordinator, who will not impinge on the operation or administrative functions of the military chiefs. The creation of such a post should be accompanied by the integration of the service headquarters with the Ministry of Defence. However, the committee has apparently recommended against integrating the three services into joint commands. This is seen as an American model tailored for expeditionary role rather than homeland defence and hence unsuitable for the Indian context.

Read: PM Modi, Parrikar to decide on chief of defence staff role next month

While the committee’s recommendations are well-intentioned and such reforms long overdue, the proposed institutional design is deeply problematic.

The idea itself is hardly new. The Group of Ministers (GoM) following the Kargil Review Committee called for the appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) as a single-point military adviser to the Defence Minister. This stemmed from the lack of integrated planning and operations between the services during the Kargil War. In fact, this is a problem that has plagued the armed forces in every conflict since 1947. The appointment of a CDS was expected to usher in top-down integration among the services and better coordination between the services and the government.

The Vajpayee government created a new joint headquarters of the Integrated Defence Staff (HQ IDS). But it baulked at appointing a CDS and instead appointed a Chief of Integrated Defence Staff who would run the HQ IDS until the CDS was appointed. This half-baked solution persists to date. In fairness, HQ IDS has managed to bring a degree of coherence to issues like procurement and joint doctrine. But this is hardly adequate. More importantly, it has allowed the political leadership to perpetuate an illusion of reforms while continuing to resist the appointment of the CDS.

Then again, in the early years after the GoM report, the services themselves were a divided house on this question. In particular, the air force resisted the creation of a CDS – apparently on the grounds that it would pave the way for institutional domination by the army. This came handy to political leaders and bureaucrats in deflecting questions about their own unwillingness to institutionalise the system. Towards the end of the UPA-II government, the three service chiefs jointly wrote to the prime minister expressing support for the creation of a CDS.

Read: Army responded appropriately to acts of aggression: Defence minister Parrikar

Meanwhile, the government had appointed another committee led by Naresh Chandra to examine why the GoM’s recommendations of were not fully implemented and to suggest a new road map for national security reforms. This committee suggested that instead of a full-fledged CDS, the government appoint a permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee with a fixed tenure. By giving the chairman a fixed term of, say, two-years, it was hoped that he would have enough time to work on key issues of integration between the services. Now the Shekatkar committee has come up with another halfway house.

Any institutional solution along these lines is unlikely to deliver the necessary levels of integration. If the CDS does not outrank the service chiefs, then his ability to function as the single-point military adviser to the government will be undoubtedly circumscribed. At best, it will amount to an incremental improvement on the existing HQ IDS. Worse still, it will yet again create the illusion of progress and delay real reforms for years at end. The idea that such reforms should be imposed gradually or piecemeal is seriously mistaken. In most countries that have achieved institutional integration, the process has been driven politically from on high.

The CDS must be empowered fully. There should be no doubt about his being superior in the chain of command to the service chiefs. The appointment should be followed by the setting up of integrated theatre commands. For starters, the supply and logistics commands could be integrated. The claim that such theatre commands is only required for expeditionary forces is specious. It is an indispensable prerequisite for ensuring “jointness” in war fighting. Simultaneously, the service chiefs should prepare to relinquish operational control over the services and become what their titles suggest: chiefs of staff, primarily responsible for raising, equipping and training of the forces. The chain of operational command should run from the Defence Minister through the CDS to the integrated theatre commanders.

Read: Suspense builds over chief of defence staff post after Bipin Rawat’s elevation

The advocates of compromise solutions miss the point that something is not always better than nothing. As the case of HQ IDS shows the half-life of such institutional short-cuts tends to be very long. More worryingly, it helps anaesthetise the system and masks need for real reform. Enhancing the combat capability and effectiveness requires full-blooded measures. It would be sad if the government perpetuates or aggravates the problem by using palliatives. It would sadder still, if the government were forced to consider real reform by another external crisis.

Outgoing US President Barack Obama telephoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to thank him for his partnership that enhanced the relations between India and America, the White House has said. Obama spoke on the phone with Modi yesterday to thank him for “his partnership” and to review joint efforts of cooperation including defence, civil-nuclear energy, and enhanced people-to-people ties, a readout of the telephonic conversation between the two leaders said.

“Recalling his visit as the chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations in 2015, President Obama wished the Prime Minister warm congratulations ahead of India’s upcoming 68th Republic Day anniversary,” the White House said.

“Both leaders discussed the progress they have made on shared economic and security priorities, including recognition of India as a major defense partner of the United States and addressing the global challenge of climate change,” it said.

Obama was one of the first leaders to congratulate Modi after his electoral victory in May 2014 and immediately invited him to visit the White House.

You May Also Want To Watch:

The two leaders met at the White House in September 2014. Since then they have met each other for eight times. This is a record for leaders between India and America.

According to Assistant Secretary of State for South and central Asia Nisha Desai Biswal, the two leaders share a very warm relationship.

“They have a great deal of personal camaraderie. But they also have a great deal of respect for each other for the leadership and the values and the integrity of each other’s approach,” Biswal told PTI in a recentl interview.

“You have seen from President Obama that appreciation of Prime Minister Modi in words that he has used to describe him including in that Time magazine profile of the Prime Minister. You have seen that Prime Minister Modi’s appreciation of President Obama, of his values, his leadership style which the Prime Minister has used to describe the President,” she said.

She said that it is not a relationship that just came about that day when President called Prime Minister-elect Modi to congratulate him.

“The seeds of this relationship were actually sown many many decades earlier,” Biswal had said.

344,"Just so we know, CBI at peak strength has capacity of investigating 1000 cases per year. At present they are understaffed by 16%. That brings the capacity down to 840 cases per year.

I imagine the number of cases against AAP alone is probably in the range of around 50. Thats 6% of total CBI capacity. So every meaningless case against AAP has a cost associated with it.

Following is an instance where CBI told the court it couldnt investigate Vyapam cases due to shortage of staff.

There is a huge mess coming, around the world. And comments by guys like this guy are what you need to get aware of.

2) any comment which purports to simplify a complex problem is suspect

For example, in his comment there are several errors which have been intentionally distributed to push agendas


&gt;And also remember that congress is doing exactly that in parliament since past two years.

Right here.

During the UPA rule, the congress did not have a majority. For both those periods the opposition made it a point to stymie the main alliance in favor of creating drama -&gt; news -&gt; voter attention -&gt; votes.

And it worked. It directly helped improve brand Modi and Modi helped brand BJP.

The BJP under Modi won an amazing victory and have a single party Majority.

Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Expect it to get much much worse after Modi's second term as the opposition learns how to do follow that example.

2) first claim on resources -
Expect a lot of assassination and drama by headline. I remember the discussions on Reddit back when this wasn't ancient history. And when someone provided context, the statements become more specific.

It's not ok when it happens to Modi or MMS. But the real victim is you.

You are being targeted for your emotions and to make you more impulsive.

Tomorrow the kind of exchange shown here will disappear. Because extremism and emotion beget more extremism and emotion.

Being non-partisan will become a sign of weakness and you will never be able to remember a time when people helped each other.

At that time, someone will say to you ""it's always been like this.""

If you remember this event, you'll be able to slow the flow and say ""no it has not.""

LUCKNOW: In a major tragedy, at least 24 school children feared dead while over 30 seriously injured when a school bus carrying over 50 children collided with a truck in police post area of Aliganj in

Etah district, around 290 km from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh on Thursday morning.

According to initial reports, the children bus of JS Vidya Public School had a head-on collision with a truck while carrying over 50 school children on way to school. The students of Class KG to 7th

standard were in bus at the time of accident.

The cause of the accident is believed to be thick fog in the morning. According to the police sources, the district administration had ordered the closure of all the schools owing to intense cold and fog but JS Vidya Public School management had kept the school opened in gross violation of the DM’s standing orders.

""More than two dozen children have died. School was open against the order of district administration to close schools due to cold,” said UP DGP Javeed Ahmad adding that priority was to rescue trapped

children. Rescue operation was underway. “Strict action would be taken against the school authorities,” he stated.

Meanwhile, the District Magistrate , Etah, has directed the police authorities to lodge an FIR against the school management for flouting the District Administration’s orders and initiated the action to get the recognition of the school cancelled.

“At least 10 school children, who are grievously injured, have been referred to Sefai super speciality hospital while others have been sent to different hospitals in adjoining Aligarh and Agra districts,” said the DM while talking to media persons.

Taking cognizance of the tragic incident, CM Akhilesh Yadav had directed the senior officials to visit the spot and ensure free treatment to the injured children.

Meanwhile, PM Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh have tweeted to express grief and pain over the tragedy wishing early recovery to the injured children.

""Anguished by tragic accident in UP’s Etah. I share the pain of the bereaved families and condole passing away of young children. I pray that those injured in the accident in Etah recover at the earliest,"" PM Modi was quoted as saying.

New Delhi: The income tax (I-T) department has written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) informing it about alleged illegal malpractices being deployed by a number of cooperative banks after its probe found “serious” difference in accounts, to the tune of multi-crore rupees, in the aftermath of the notes ban.

In an analysis report prepared by the department, also accessed by PTI, two specific instances in Mumbai and Pune have been reported where it was found that over Rs113 crore “excess amount” of old demonetised notes was reported by two banks to the banking regulator in order to generate black funds. “In the Pune bank case, the reported amount (to the RBI) was Rs242 crore while physical stock was of Rs141 crore, showing clearly that the cooperative bank had reported to the RBI excess Specified Bank Notes (old currency) as on 23 December 2016 to the tune of Rs101.07 crore. In the case of a similar bank in Mumbai, the excess amount of such notes was Rs11.89 crore,” it said.

The department had conducted surveys on these two banks last year, post the notes ban, and it “detected serious unexplained difference between the old notes reported to the RBI and the physical stock” available in the bank during the said operation. Officials said it had informed the RBI about these alleged malpractices earlier and is regularly updating it about such modus operandi being deployed by a number of such banks as it apprehends that the “excess reporting of old notes had serious potential for large scale conversion of old notes for new notes even after 30 December 2016 (the last date for the validity of the old notes)”. In this backdrop, RBI had issued a circular on 30 December last year requiring all banks to deposit all old notes received till 30 December 2016 with RBI chests by the next day, ie, 31 December 2016 and also stating that old notes cannot form part of the closing cash balance of banks as on 31 December 2016.

“A big possible window that would have allowed conversion of black money into white, post demonetisation, by the cooperative bank system was plugged to a larger extent after the I-T department detected these instances. In cases where such an activity has already taken place, the investigation is ongoing and notices have been issued,” officials said.

The I-T department has earlier raised serious concerns over the working of a number of cooperative banks across the country in a earlier report where it had claimed that they used the “opportunity” of demonetisation to make a quick buck and indulge in money laundering worth several crores. An analysis report prepared by the department had said tax sleuths found these banks have been involved in generating and routing of black money at an “unprecedented” scale post 8 November when the currency scrap was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

I-T probe had found that in the case of such a bank based in the small town of Alwar in Rajasthan, the directors of the bank cheated it of Rs8 crore “by fraudulently obtaining loans in the names of 90 persons of doubtful identities” even as it was used to launder personal “unaccounted cash” of Rs2 crore by the management. Several such instances were chronicled by the department in its report submitted to the finance ministry and shared with the RBI for action.

Mumbai, Hong Kong: Analysts scratching their heads over the impact on India’s banks of the country’s move to ban high-value notes have every right to be puzzled, as estimates offered by the chairman of State Bank of India (SBI) indicate.

The bank could retain anything from 15% to 40% of the deposit boost it received after the government withdrew about four-fifths of the banknotes in circulation in November, Arundhati Bhattacharya said in an interview on Wednesday with Bloomberg Television’s Erik Schatzker. She was unable to give a precise estimate amid uncertainty about how much of that money came from Indian businesses as opposed to individuals.

If much of the money that came was being used in business, “then much of it will get taken out because people will want to use it in their business again,” Bhattacharya, 60, said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

“But if much of this money is from savings of people, which was sitting in their cupboards or wherever, then obviously it won’t go out,” she said. “Once it’s in the bank, it’ll stay in the bank and therefore that’s why we have a very wide kind of range.”

For weeks, investors have speculated over whether the surging bank deposits caused by the 8 November ban on high-value notes will ultimately benefit lenders. The S&amp;P Bankex Index, which tracks 10 lenders, rose almost 4% following the move, before slumping 13% and has since clawed back much of that slump.

“Retaining more deposits means low cost funds that can be lend out to improve bottom line at banks,” Payal Pandya, a Mumbai-based analyst at Centrum Wealth Management Ltd, said by phone. “Lenders focus should shift to deploying the money as loans as soon as they can.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the nation by banning old Rs500 and RS1,000 notes, a move that dragged cash-intensive businesses to a standstill and had millions of Indians lining up at banks to deposit their now invalidated currencies or exchange them for new notes. The resulting liquidity surge brought funding costs down for lenders including State Bank of India, giving them scope to cut interest rates.

SBI’s low-cost deposits had surged by Rs1.4 trillion after the cash ban and the lender is seeing “unprecedented liquidity,” Bhattacharya told reporters on 2 January after unveiling a rate cut. While the company’s loan book had contracted after the ban, advances in the year to 31 March are expected to expand as much as 9%, compared with about 6.7% as of 31 December, she said the same day.

While the currency ban has raised concerns over growth in Asia’s second-largest economy, it has boosted digital payment services including the government-backed Unified Payments Interface, providing an opportunity for Modi to further his initiatives to offer banking services to more of the country’s 1.3 billion people.

“What needs to be done is that the digital initiatives that we had started, that those get the same kind of focus, and that we now disincentivize the use of cash,” Bhattacharya said at Davos. “If you’re going to slide back into the ways that we had before this demonetization impact, then you really won’t get the benefits.” Bloomberg

In this regard, the Congress is joined by the opposition DMK. The latter believes the saffron BJP is trying to 'brahminise' Tamil Nadu by not allowing jallikattu, even though the decision to ban it was taken by the Supreme Court in May 2014.



In fact, last year on January 7, the BJP-led Centre revoked the ban on Jallikattu via a notification.



""The mother of problem is the Congress-led UPA government which included bulls in performing list in 2011"", said Union environment minister Anil Madhav Dave.

Will cricket will also be banned now, he asks. (ANI)

Jumping in support of support of Jallikattu protest today, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev asked whether the government will also ban cricket, which is almost like a religion in the country. He added that the cricket ball is also quite dangerous and had been fatal for so many cricketers.

Earlier in the day ex-Test cricketer K Srikanth asked whether the authorities will also ban boxing as ot is also fatal for pugilists at times. Since Tuesday, thousands of people have gathered in Marina beach in Chennai and rest of the country protesting against the ban on the age old sport. In 2014, the Supreme Court had banned the sport after some activists voiced concerned over it citing cruelty towards the animal.

With pressure mounting on him, state Chief Minister O Pannerselvam met Prime Minister Narendra Modi today over the issue, who assured him all support to save the culture of the state. Both leaders also spoke on the drought situation in the state. The day also say PMK MP and former Union minister Ambumani Ramdoss sitting in front of the prime minister’s residence demanding ordinance by the Centre.

Several filmstars have also come in support of the agitators. Last Saturday, actor Rajnikanth also voiced in support of lifting of the ban stressing that the sport should be allowed in the state as it is part of the culture in tamil Nadu. Actors Suriya Sivakumar and Vijay also came in support of agitators on Tuesday. Surya said that the protests of thousands of agitators show the mood of the people of the state.

I-T dept writes to RBI; says co-op banks' cash records tampered with

Its probe found ""serious"" difference in accounts, to the tune of multi-crore rupees

The Income Tax Department has written to the RBI informing it about alleged illegal malpractices being deployed by a number of cooperative banks after its probe found ""serious"" difference in accounts, to the tune of multi-crore rupees, in the aftermath of the notes ban. In an analysis report prepared by the department, also accessed by PTI, two specific instances in Mumbai and Pune have been reported where it was found that over Rs 113 crore ""excess amount"" of old demonetised notes was reported by two banks to the banking regulator in order to generate black funds. ""In the Pune bank case, the reported amount (to the RBI) was Rs 242 crore while physical stock was of Rs 141 crore, showing clearly that the cooperative bank had reported to the RBI excess Specified Bank Notes (old currency) as on December 23, 2016 to the tune of Rs 101.07 crore. In the case of a similar bank in Mumbai, the excess amount of such notes was Rs 11.89 crore,"" it said. The department had conducted surveys on .

The Department has written to the informing it about alleged illegal malpractices being deployed by a number of after its probe found ""serious"" difference in accounts, to the tune of multi-crore rupees, in the aftermath of the notes ban.



In an analysis report prepared by the department, also accessed by PTI, two specific instances in and have been reported where it was found that over Rs 113 crore ""excess amount"" of old demonetised notes was reported by two banks to the regulator in order to generate black funds.



""In the bank case, the reported amount (to the RBI) was Rs 242 crore while physical stock was of Rs 141 crore, showing clearly that the cooperative bank had reported to the excess Specified Bank Notes (old currency) as on December 23, 2016 to the tune of Rs 101.07 crore.

In cases where such an activity has already taken place, the investigation is ongoing and notices have been issued,"" officials said.



The department has earlier raised serious concerns over the working of a number of across the country in a earlier report where it had claimed that they used the ""opportunity"" of to make a quick buck and indulge in money laundering worth several crores.



An analysis report prepared by the department had said sleuths found these banks have been involved in generating and routing of at an ""unprecedented"" scale post November 8 when the currency scrap was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

As a wave of protest sweep through Tamil Nadu over a ban on the bull-taming sport Jallikattu, an HT explainer on the sport and the controversy

What is Jallikattu

An ancient blood sport said to date back to 400 BC, Jallikattu is organised during the mid-January harvest festival, Pongal. It involves releasing a bull into a crowd of people when participants attempt to grab its hump and ride it as long as possible. Sometimes, participants must also try and remove red flags attached to the bull’s horns.

The SC ban

The Supreme Court banned the sport in 2014, upholding concerns raised by activists who said the Jallikattu amounted to cruelty to animal besides posing a threat to humans. Between 2010 and 2014, an estimated 17 people were killed and 1000-odd were injured during Jallikatu events. The Supreme Court said, “use of bulls in such events severely harmed the animals and constituted an offence under the Prevention of Cruelty to the Animals Act.”

Government’s reaction

Though the ban was more or less effective in 2015, the Centre took note of requests from pro-Jallikattu groups and the Tamil Nadu government to pass and order in January, 2016, exempting the sport from performances where bulls cannot be used, reversing the ban. Just a few days later, the Supreme Court struck down the government order to uphold its ban.

Present crisis

On January 12, 2017, the Supreme Court rejected a plea by a group of lawyers seeking an urgent ruling on a clutch of petitions on Jallikattu so that the sport can be organised during this year’s Pongal celebrations. This infuriated large sections of Tamil Nadu’s population who perceive the ban as an affront to the state’s tradition and culture.

The protests

Defying the apex court ruling, people started organising the sport at many places as the ruling AIADMK and opposition parties backed the pro-Jallikattu groups. The protest which began in the rural areas, soon found support from the urban elite – students, IT professionals, the salaried and even sports persons and actors in capital Chennai. The iconic Marina Beach in Chennai has turned into a hub of pro-Jallikattu demonstrations since Tuesday with thousands of people camping at the seafront demanding lifting of the ban.

Political context

Political analysts say the growing anger was reminiscent of the anti-Centre sentiments in the late 1960s after Hindi was made the official language of the country. With the Dravidian parties supporting pro-Jallikattu groups, the protests have intensified over the past few days, posing a big challenge for the BJP-led government at the Centre. Chief Minister O Panneerselvam is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue.

NEW DELHI: Thousands of people are protesting at Marina Beach in Chennai, demanding revocation of ban on Jallikattu imposed by the Supreme Court in 2014. The peaceful protest has reached every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu. So much so, newly appointed Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu O. Paneerselvam has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi today to discuss the removal of ban on the sport.So far, you know that Jallikattu is a bull-taming sport and an integral part of Tamil culture Here's a lowdown on all you should know about the sport and the controversy:In ancient times, the sport was described as Yeru thazhuvuthal, which means embracing the bull. Jallikattu comes from salli or jalli (coins) and kattu (bag). It refers to a bag of coins which was tied to the bull's horns and the winner had to retrieve. Another popular name Manju Virattu means chasing the bull.The sport, which is organised all across the state, has several other names such as Yeruthazhuvuthal, Madu Pidithal and Pollerudhu Pidithal. Jallikattu, which is celebrated at Alanganallur near Madurai, is the most popular.Jallikattu is a traditional bull-chasing sport of Tamil Nadu which is organised during the harvest festival Pongal. The sport is more than two millennia old. A 2,500-year-old cave painting discovered near Madurai, shows a man trying to control a bull. There are references to Jallikattu in Sangam literature too. But the Jallikattu as we know it may have emerged only in recent times.It is believed the sport was not cruel earlier. It became more competitive when people started betting on bulls in modern times. Its link to caste pride also made it more cruel. In Tamil novel Kamalambal Charithiram written by B.R. Rajam Iyer in 1893, the landlord skins alive his bull that has lost in Jallikattu.The participants try to hold on to the hump of the bull for a particular time or distance. To control the bull, they try to grab it by the horns or the tail. In another variant, the bull is tied to a long rope and a team of players has to subdue the bull within a specific time to win. In all variants, the aim is to subdue or embrace the bull.Earlier, a small bag of coins which is known as 'jalli' or 'salli' used to be tied to the horns of the bull. The participants tried to retrieve the bag. Now it's not just a bag of coins. These days many people bet big money on the bulls.The game separates the men from the boys. It is considered a test of masculinity. In Tamil ethos, the act of taming the bull has stood for virility and male power since ancient times.There are instances in the Dravidian literature where the winner of Jallikattu gets to marry the daughter of the village head. In Kalithogai, a later Sangam work, the poems mention young women falling in love with those who could tame the bulls.Jallikattu bulls are exceptional. They descend from the Kangayam breed which is fierce and belligerent. They are stronger than usual and have sturdier build. These bulls are prone to attack at slightest provocation. Another breed popular in Jallikattu is Bangur bulls which are known for their speed. Apart from their genetic edge, Jallikattu bulls are fed very well by their owners, which makes them even stronger.According to an estimate, there were one million Kangayam bulls in 1990 and now they have been reduced to 15,000. Jallikattu supporters say the sport is an incentive for people to rear these native breeds which are going extinct.Jallikattu was first challenged by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) in 2004. The Supreme Court banned Jallikattu acknowledging that it is inherently cruel “as bulls are not anatomically suited to such activities, and that forcing them to participate subjects them to unnecessary pain and suffering"".A review petition was filed by the Tamil Nadu government to lift the ban but the court dismissed it in November 2016. A fresh appeal was made to allow Jallikattu during Pongal by O. Paneerselvam after he took charge as the chief minster in January but the bench declined to issue any interim order. On Wednesday, The Madras High Court said it would not interfere on the issue of protests happening across the state.PETA and other many animal rights activists say the sport is cruel not only because the bulls are violently tamed but also because sometimes they are made to consume alcohol and chillies are rubbed into their eyes to provoke them. The bulls are not just subdued; their tails are twisted and even bitten in most painful manner. Many other acts of cruelty are done to provoke them to enter the arena.The Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Federation is against a blanket ban on the sport but it agrees that people should be prevented from harming the bulls during the sport. Many other Jallikattu supporters also argue against the blanket ban but for regulating the sport to prevent cruelty to bulls.

SANGAM (ALLAHABAD): TheVishwa Hindu Parishad(VHP) will give theNarendra Modigovernment three months' time after the assembly elections to construct the Ram temple atAyodhya. The decision was taken in a 'Chintan Shivir' organised during theMagh melaon Wednesday. The VHP will postpone the campaigning for construction of the Ram temple till the polls are over in the five states.



The VHP also warned the central government that it would organise a march to the Parliament with about 80 lakh members if the latter failed to speed up the process for building the Ram temple. VHP's international general secretary, Champat Rai presided over the meeting.



""We have suspended all the agitation for building the Ram temple with immediate effect as theBharatiya Janata Partyis engaged in assembly polls. The campaigning will intensify after the polls,"" Rai said in the meet, which was attended by VHP leaders from Awadh, Kashi, Kanpur and Gorakhpur prants (regions).



He added, ""VHP will be giving only 90 days' time after the elections. We want the government to expedite the process for creating a special bench for day-to-day hearing of the temple case or pass a bill in the Lok Sabha for building the temple. If either of the two demands are not met, then Modi government should be ready to face the VHP.""



He said the central government is dilly dallying over the Ram temple issue due to which resentment is brewing among the saint community.



""Saints are not ready to hear any excuse whatsoever from the Modi government. I urged VHP office bearers and saints to prepare themselves for an agitation if the government again fails to fulfil our demands,"" he added. VHP claimed that people have given a mandate to Narendra Modi led government to build the temple.

Individual personalities do end up accelerating/decelerating the general trend, but it seldom has a lasting effect on the course of diplomatic relations. I tend to agree. 

Luckily, our last three Prime Ministers -- Vajpayee, MMS, and Modi -- have all pushed for stronger ties rather than pandering to the side that reflexively views the US as an adversary. MMS gets extra credit for battering through communist opposition to move ahead with the nuclear deal. In my mind, that boldness and resolve was one of the reasons the UPA swept the 2009 elections.

They are understandably nervous about fucking up - they know they aren't qualified - so they take the path of least resistance. That's how you end up with endless delays and endless imports. Nobody wants to take a stand because everybody knows they can't defend it once questioned.

They really need to direct sustained attention from the state and create IAS officers *for life* dealing with these issues. You need very long lead times to get this process right, especially if you want indigenous production. India already has a capital-intensive manufacturing base. That's basically ideal for a strong domestic defence industry. You add a rapidly growing economy on top of that and you're set.

: The Narendra Modi government ""owed"" demonetisation to the nation and it had to do it to eradicate black money menace and to bring hoarded cash back into the banking system, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday.Speaking at a panel decision, on 'India's Time to Transform', at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, she said it may sound 'propagandist' but one needs a strong and courageous leadership to take such a bold step.On why government felt it was necessary to do the demonetisation, Ms Sitharaman said it was part of the ""electoral promise we made to check the black money menace"".

""Right after coming to power, we started with setting up the special investigation team, came out with scheme for declaration of undisclosed money, tightened tax treaties with different countries to check round tripping of money. We took all these steps.""""This step of demonetisation was absolutely necessary... 87 per cent of our economy was informal and only in cash-driven segments where money would not go to banks... only about 50 lakh people pay tax and all others who file the returns do not file any tax,"" she said.""Can we survive if this kind of tax to GDP ratio continues... we had to do it, we owed it to the country and we do not regret it,"" Ms Sitharaman said.""Even if it sounds propagandist... you need a strong and courageous leadership to take such a bold step,"" she said.The panel discussion, on theme of India's turn to transform, also discussed the fight against corruption and black money including through the recent demonetisation move.In the same panel, Kenneth Rogoff, professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University, said the same step could have been done in a more systematic manner.On why it could not have been done with more public planning, Ms Sitharaman said it could have been done but Indians are ""smart"" and they would have ""sensed"" it and people could have stashed the money somewhere.State Bank of India chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya said what was amazing that there were huge crowds outside banks but still there was no riot or any loss of life and the fact is nobody took law and order into his hands is amazing.""I receive complaints of misbehaviour otherwise everyday but this was one period when there was no single complaint. This was a different feeling and I don't know how it came around,"" Ms Bhattacharya said.She agreed that psychologically people agreed with the move.Ms Bhattacharya said queues are a thing of past in urban areas though a few are still there in some rural areas.""What the problem really is, there were many small and medium businesses that were earning profit but were not paying tax. They feel their margins would not give them ability to carry out business post this and they are worried.""""This is one India where we will need to convince them that they come into the tax net if they are earning enough for paying taxes,"" she said.From 2006 and 2016, the portion of high value notes went up considerably to 86 per cent, she added.Ms Sitharaman said no part of the country faced any problem because the ministers and officials were moving around the country to take stock of situation and to take necessary measures throughout this 50-day period.""I am absolutely shocked and I pay my respect to my fellow citizens for going through the hardship and be part of this exercise,"" she added.Argentina's central bank governor Federico Sturzenegger said they have been thinking about such a step for quite some time, that is to phase out high value notes, and he admires India for taking this bold step.Regarding Argentina, he said there was also a problem of security and robbery, because of which they have been thinking about it. Besides, they were also concerned about the high costs attached to printing of currency notes and the current system was subsidising cash.""About three years ago, we took a quick decision regarding payment of bus systems when we phased out coins and asked people to use cards and the exercise was very successful leaving us with huge amount of coins that people were not willing to take.""""We also asked the banks to digitise money following which networks came into operation across various banks and it worked pretty well because of high penetration of smart phones,"" Mr Sturzenegger said.Now the next step is to push the people to use digital accounts, he said, adding that Argentina is taking ideas from Sweden in this regard.Argentina's central banker, however, said they were not very ""keen on surprising people"" and their focus was more to move the economy to ""more formal economy"".On the surprise element, Ms Sitharaman said it was a ""one-time attack on the stock"" and it worked as the stock came back to the banks.""The moment the money has come into banks, it is no more anonymous and it has to be identified with somebody. In India, unaccounted cash or black money is a major issue... You have to think that the cash to GDP ratio was very high, unlike Argentina where this ratio was very low,"" she said.She said India has a great mobile penetration, though not only of smart phones. Even for those not having smart phones, the mobile app we have come out with is very popular and the USSD function doesn't depend on internet connectivity and can be used by just SMS.She said some people in Delhi and metros are still skeptical but vegetable sellers and others in villages are very comfortable with the mobile and app based payments.Carmen M Reinhart, Professor at Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said she concurred with the view that it was ""short run pain and long run gain"".She said she tried to look for comparable experiments when the move was announced in November, she found there were small cases of some countries phasing out high value notes.Ms Reinhart, however, said she still has a ""pet peeve"" at the way it was handled - that is India is also undertaking another extremely bold step of GST and I would have preferred it to be done after GST was done deal.She agreed with the fears that the GST rollout could be impacted by the demonetisation move.Ms Bhattacharya said some implementation issues were there and to study all the accounts that could have been used (to launder money) is a humongous task.""To say how much successful it has been, it needs to be seen how things pan out. We are already seeing a huge surge in the quantum of card transactions. But the day the ATM limits were raised to Rs 10,000, the card transactions began to fall,"" she said.Mr Rogoff said one also needs to follow it up to realise the long term benefits.On whether GST could have been done earlier, Ms Sitharaman said the GST is going through a process and the government is confident it will get through from July 1.She said there was a view that the GST was going though a process and it depended on so many other things including about states agreeing to it, while on the other hand the black money problem was a electoral promise.""There was no choosing between the two,"" she said.About steps being taken to improve the ease of doing business, Ms Sitharaman said the government is ""at it"" and is an ongoing work.She also emphasised that the major enabler is the ""digitised approach"".According to her, it is not possible today that the country would go back to the time when tax inspectors could harass people.There are some automated process with minimum human interface, that throws out names and only those entities need to explain to the tax department. Such cases could be inspected further, she added.""In no way we will be going back to the inspector raj,"" she asserted.NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said India is on the cusp of a major revolution as one would need just his thumb to transact and this has not happened anywhere in the world and would leave cards and POS machines etc totally redundant.Every single mobile will have a thumb and iris impressions that will make each one of us a walking ATM, he added.Ms Bhattacharya said it is very much possible but added that banking system will still grow as the proposed measures would only take care of payment transactions and the banks are much more beyond that.

&gt;* Speaking at the inaugural session of the Raisina Dialogue on Tuesday, Narendra Modi had said: Respect for sovereignty is important for regional connectivity to improve.

&gt;* In the management of our relationship, and for peace and progress in the region, both our countries need to show sensitivity and respect for each others core concerns and interests, he added.

&gt;* When asked to respond to Mr Modis remarks at a media briefing, Hua Chunying, the spokesperson for Chinas foreign ministry, said: Regarding CPEC, this is a project that is devised for long-term development and cooperation in various fields...

&gt;* Chinas territorial assertion over Asia received a jolt in July 2016 when the Permanent Court of Arbitration gave an adverse verdict on the South China Sea issue.

KOLKATA: At a time when the Centre has taken a tough stance towards China, at least 25Chinese giantsare headed towards Bengal, eyeing a slice of its business pie.



By inviting the Chinese delegations, chief ministerMamata Banejeehas taken up yet another point to differ with prime minister Narendra Modi. The delegation, covering a wide range of industries, will be a major show-off point for Mamata, as many are likely to announce investment proposals.



The delegation comprises two provinces of China — Jiangsu and Shaanxi — that are known for being industry intensive.



In case of Shaanxi, a large representation comes from the department of commerce and the foreign affairs office of the provincial government. They will also be coming for the summit, which has boosted the hope of investment.



The Shaanxi province showed its interest in Bengal during a recent visit of the executive vice governor of the province, Yao Yinliang, on November 30. Chief secretary Basudeb Banerjee and Yao had a long discussion about the areas of co-operation and possible investment.



The state government has already received confirmations from big Shaanxi enterprises in the field of coal, chemicals, textiles and fruit and food processing like, Shaanxi Coal and Chemical Industry Group Co. Ltd, China Shaanxi Haihui Import and Export Co. Ltd, Baoji Changxin Cloth Co. Ltd, Shaanxi Haisheng Fresh Fruit Juice Co. Ltd and easy Click Worldwide Network Technology.



The biggest names from Jiangsu in the field of manufacturing, construction, software, IT solutions and printing, also feature on the list of confirmations. The delegation from Jiangsu is also backed by the department of commerce of its provincial government. Names like Sinocalci Corporation, AsiaInfo Technologies (Nanjing), Jiangsu HopeRun Software Co. Ltd, Archermind Technology (Nanjing), Nanjing Fujitsu Nanda Software technology Co. Ltd will be present at the Summit.



""While some delegates are arriving on Wednesday, the rest will be here by Thursday. The entire delegation will be present at the inauguration of the summit on January 20. Before that a large number of business to business meets have been lined up, the results of which they might announce at the summit,"" said, Ma Zhanwu, consul general of China in Kolkata.



He added, this is just the beginning of co-operation that China had been looking for with Bengal. ""The scope for development in Bengal is huge as the pace has been slower here. This has a lot of advantage, the biggest being, low cost of labour and government support,"" Zhanwu added.

Ever locked eyes with the Kangayam bull? Nudging the bustling commercial and export districts of Tirupur and Erode is Kangayam, whose eponymous bulls are prized champions among other sporting breeds, and are the talking point across India over Jallikattu.

The Kangayam bull, immortalised in popular iconography by Rajinikanth in the movie Murattu Kalai (The Rogue Bull), is a handsome fellow. His eyes maintain a proud look, his hump and hind curve like the ripple of a ribbon and he makes an arresting picture when he stands in the midst of a ploughed field, clearly lord of what he surveys. Unlike the Haryanvi bull which carries menace in its gait, the Kangayam bull is a sport, ready for game, and a beast that is not quite a brute. He’s doughty and strong, capable of withstanding drought and hard labour. Trussed up and garlanded he is the star of all Pongal celebrations.

It is not surprising that these bovines are an inspiration for the paintings of Tamil artist AV Ilango, who hails from the neighbouring district near Kangayam and his work is an ode to his rural roots.

With time farming practices have adopted mechanisation and transportation, even in drought marked regions in Tamil Nadu. Yet the bulls have their place in agrarian order, in little traditions and village customs and in rural sports like jallikattu. The rules of this all-male sport once asked for the participant to hang on to the hump of a running bull for a minute to be rewarded with sporting glory. It brought with it gladiatorial aspects of betting and buffing the participant’s masculine profile as a qualifier in the marriage market. It also kept rural entertainment and cultural traditions alive, away from the national and international spotlight like other sports like equestrianism that enjoy royal sanction and elite participants. Like the Brahman bulls that hoofed their way from India to America in the early 20th century and are now held up for their superior breeding and meat, the bulls of Tamil Nadu are healthy breeders too.

The current row over Jallikattu, which began over the Supreme Court ordering a ban on the games over animal cruelty, has sharply divided opinions. Times have changed, rules have slackened and inhumanity crept in. Feminists attack the outdated masculinity that comes with the sport; animal rights activists want to end the cruelty to the bulls by some participants who want to up the excitement with rural sponsorships demanding higher championships stakes; Dalit activists have called out the sport, played out in Madurai and its neighbouring regions, as it showcases the Thevar caste muscle; political watchers have pointed out that the current Thevar political stronghold of Tamil Nadu’s leadership is showcasing its strength with versus Prime Minister Modi whose posters has been defaced by protestors in Madurai and on the Marina.

The spontaneous student mass protests at the Marina, the voices from other Tamil sporting champions, AR Rahman, and the Tamil movie stars is an assertion of the cultural pride of a people often accused of regional chauvinism. On ground and across social media is the same irritation amongst the protestors from the provinces and Tamil techies across the seas that the Jallikattu row is seen as a regional sport with ethnic quirks by the rest of India, the same way they find the state’s politics and movies as Tamil cultural oddities.

What seems more sensible is to bring strict regulatory practices into the sport that will disqualify participants when checked for substances or cruel behavior. Like the other contact sport of Tamil Nadu, kabbadi that got fancy with the backing of Bollywood stars, the Tamil movie stars who went on protest on 20 January, can come forward to buy teams. Rural sports will benefit from patrons from business houses of the state who can sponsor the games and ensure strict rules for keeping beast and man on a sporting keel.

For a state recently beleaguered over the loss of its leader and a shake-up in the political leadership, a state that came together with humanism over natural calamity, Jallikattu has turned into a symbol of self-assertion and people power.

Jallikattu is unacceptable: Argument that it’s Tamil culture doesn’t hold up

The repeated neglect of Tamil identity is the rallying point for Jallikattu protests

The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) is learnt to have moved a cabinet note earlier this week for this purpose. (Reuters)

The government is planning to tweak certain provisions of the “fund of funds” — the R10,000-crore corpus announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help fund start-ups — to expedite the release of such assistance, as the Start-up India programme completed a year this week, sources said.

The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) is learnt to have moved a cabinet note earlier this week for this purpose. The move seems prompted by the fact that although the creation of the fund of funds was announced a year ago and formally approved by the Cabinet in June last year, no start-up has been able to benefit from such an idea.

“There could be some change in the percentage of funding support to be committed by SIDBI (Small Industries Development Bank of India). It could be to the tune of 35%,” said a source.

The fund of funds, being managed by SIDBI, is supposed to invest in Sebi-registered alternative investment funds which, in turn, will invest in start-ups. Thus, this fund is to act as an enabler in attracting private investment in the form of equity and quasi-equity for start-ups.

You may also like to watch this

Chander Sawhney, partner and head (valuation and deals) at Corporate Professionals, said currently SIDBI commits only 15% from the money allocated to it by the government, while venture capitalists are supposed to generate or collect the balance 85% to set up this fund of funds, which will invest in start-ups. “Since the market conditions are unfavourable, VCs are unable to generate this 85%. So the fund to invest in these start-ups hasn’t yet been formed despite the commitments of funds by SIDBI. So naturally, no start-up has benefited so far. If SIDBI raises the support to, say, 30-35%, it would be a good move,” he said.

According to the Cabinet decision, the committed corpus (of R10,000 crore) would be built up over the 14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles. But this is subject to the progress of the scheme and the availability of funds. The government has already released Rs 500 crore to SIDBI for 2015-16 and Rs 600 crore was earmarked for 2016-17.

The fund is expected to generate 1.8 million jobs. Not many start-ups have also benefited from the government’s decision to allow income tax exemption for three years to eligible start-ups. According to the latest data, only eight out of 111 start-ups that could be considered for tax exemption have got such relief. However, this has more to do with the lack of adequate innovative nature of start-ups or worthwhile contribution to society at large than lack of the DIPP initiative.For its part, DIPP has recommended a seven-year tax holiday on profits made by the start-ups.

According to the Finance Act, 2016, start-ups are eligible to get income tax exemption for three years in a block of five years if they are incorporated between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2019. To get these benefits, a start-up needs to obtain a certificate of eligibility from the inter-ministerial board of the DIPP.

Given the fact that start-ups hardly make any profits in initial years and most of them even fail, commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been pitching for greater tax support to start-ups. In their meetings with Sitharaman earlier this year, various start-ups had urged her to persuade the finance ministry to raise the period of the tax holiday.

You said the following: ""I've seen some actually cruel ceremonies that were certainly illegal, and the cops weren't showing up.""

Tell me a single ceremony on a scale of Jallikattu and that was/is politically and emotionally charged as this one.

&gt; A lot of shit can be manipulated, laziness is a sorry excuse to outright ban something.

But this is precisely what happens on the ground. Do you really think everything is magically perfect when enforcing the rules? 

&gt; Most people protesting aren't exactly rich people with a ton of money to spare. If you could actually front the money to provide a sanctuary for even say 60-70% of bulls with the ability to provide for their upkeep, I might switch sides.

But the protests are for jallikattu, the sport, not for safe guarding the continuation of the species directly. If The scale of the protests is anything to go by, I don't see why the government can do something. While a few people can't do it on their own the numbers are large enough to get a viable alternative in a few years. I will be the first person to donate.

&gt; You just brought up a new hypothetical and I'm saying it's better than being slaughtered early on. Idk what's confusing about 
that.

But those were the only two options you argued for the sport. It is not a hypothetical. There are always options. I'm simply pointing them out.

&gt; Again provide a realistic option for that, and then we can talk. That's a lot of upkeep that most people who truly care, can't afford that.

I want the indigenous species to thrive. I think you and protestors do as well. The CM's letter to Modi said the same thing. 

So the protests must change its tone from getting jallikattu back to saving the species through humane ways.

&gt; Idk, I also laid out a condition. If the fact that I didn't think about every potential way to abuse an animal for an argument on Reddit is the reason someone is fucking/not fucking an animal, I wouldn't be too high on the chances of convincing them of anything

The inability to convince people to make them walk a tight-rope of regulations is precisely what happens on the ground at Jallikattu. There can always be different interpretations because of the dynamics of the people involved.

I'll tell why I'm so sure about this because I know who or what type of people participate in the sport. In 2014, I visited ground zero with a friend who volunteered his bull. Here's the background:

Rich farmers/zamindars who have the luxury to raise and train the prize bull make up 90% of the participants. They enter for their honor, pride of having their bull be the temple bull. If they win, by the bull's proxy they gain control of inter-village authority on cow reproduction of many many thaluks. They can simply deny their bull to mate with anyone who they don't like or any caste they don't like. The farmers who lose out have no option to breed their cows and eventually the cause so many are fighting against. If a lesser-status farmer even tries to enter in the competition, the status/power dynamic comes into effect and he will be at the risk of being ostracised from the community. Casteism is huge problem in rural TN. That's why the dalit community is against jallikattu.

While my friend's bull lost, the only reason he was able to do it in the first place because he had the resources to do it and no one from his village was interested in.  ",2017-01-20 13:15:25

The Hyderabad MP then said, “I have been consistently saying that uniform civil code is not good for the diversity and pluralism of this great nation of ours and diversity and pluralism are the ethos of this country. It is not going to help our country by having uniform civil code. “For example, can an agreement be arrived on what should be the inheritance according to the Mitakshara and Dayabhaga schools?

Paytm chief Vijay Shekhar Sharma is thrilled about 2017. A video from Paytm’s annual office party (Revolution 2017) uploaded by OfficeChai.com shows him giving a speech on Paytm’s success, claiming ‘the company has done in one year what others couldn’t even in 10 years’.

On November 8, 2016, 86% of India’s currency was nullified in a shocking move made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to curb endemic corruption. All 500 and 1,000 rupee notes were demonetised, triggering India’s biggest ever cash crunch.

But the nation of jugaad found an alternative way. “Paytm Karo” became the new buzz as the country’s largest mobile wallet became an alternative for cash for many.

Petrol pumps, shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, restaurants - everyone lapped it up. From television commercials in major cities to full-page ads in newspapers, Paytm has made its presence felt everywhere. The app has been translated into several Indian languages and the company has even set up how-to-use-the-app boot camps. It now has the license to be a payments bank.

In the video, Sharma is motivating the crowd, shouting (and occassionally cussing), “Humne kuch socha, humne kuch socha, humne kuch socha, aur saala doosron ki pant geeli nahin hui to kya socha?”

The performance reminded many of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who was known for his charged on-stage appearances at Microsoft developer conferences.

To all those poking fun at PayTM CEO's antics at an office party - He is not the first. There was a Steve Ballmer. — Shyam (@shyamk) January 18, 2017

While Sharma boasted about how Paytm has grown by leaps and bounds, “Ab koi India mein hamari taraf nahi dekh raha, kyon? Hamare ko saara desh nahi, saari duniya dekh rahi hai!” (Now no one in India is watching us because the entire world is), Twitterati was largely in support of the startup chief’s words.

But Sharma is unperturbed. “Jo humare saath nahin wo royenge,” he shouts out. Those who aren’t with us will be left crying!

The BJP despite all the hullahup about Apple asking for concessions, hasn't provided any, atleast not yet.

The power sector has surplus power for the first time. Infact many power plants are running at 50 percent capacity.

The NOIDA electronics assembly hub is something, atleast better than importing finished products from China. Now atleast the last stage profits are taxed in India. Without proper skill, every nation must start with the grunt work.

Electrification despite being skewed, is magnitudes faster than the time of  Congress, and even if the work is being exaggerated by 5 times, it's still better than UPA 2.

Perhaps it's because of there being no coalition. But it's basically due to the power vacuum in Congress. Anyway India will grow at the rate it is supposed to depending mainly on how hard the common man works. The government is there to NOT fuckup and maintain a good image for the country, which Modi being widely criticized during his election for the Riots, he has managed to secure better footing. This too maybe because of China slowing down and becoming more of a problem for the US. But he did not fuckup, that's more than can be said of upa

On Friday, US President Barack Obama formally ends his term, and will no longer be the President of the United States of America. Funnily enough, once that change takes place, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will become the most followed leader of a country on Twitter. Obama holds this spot right now, with almost 81 million followers on the social network, well ahead of any global leader.

The next political figure on the list is PM Modi, with 26.5 million followers, ahead of the next American president, Donald Trump, who has 20.5 million followers. After them the PMO India account comes in with 15.5 million followers, and the POTUS account, with 13.6 million followers. The White House also has 13.4 million followers, but the next leader in the list are the Dalai Lama, with 13.1 million followers, and the Pope, with 12.5 million followers.

PM Modi has even more followers on Facebook, at 39.2 million, while his Instagram and YouTube followings have crossed 5.8 million and 5.9 million respectively.

Like both Obama and Trump, PM Modi is also known for the use of social media to campaign, and directly reach out to voters. Social networking platforms have also been used by various leaders in India, particularly from the ruling party, to reach out to the public for day to day activities.

It is worth pointing out though that the most followed people on social media are not world leaders but entertainers - Katy Perry has the top spot, with 95.3 million followers, and Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift come in second and third, at 91.2 million and 83.1 million respectively. The most followed organisation is YouTube, which has 66.1 million followers on Twitter, while Twitter itself has 58.6 million.

Another interesting note is the number of accounts these leaders follow - Donald Trump has the most curated list, following just 42 accounts. PM Modi follows 1,641 accounts, but Obama's Twitter handle follows a whopping 631,987 accounts.

&gt;* The need for secrecy meant that minutes of the meeting were not recorded.Mr Patel has told parliamentary panels that the RBI agreed with the government's assessment of the notes ban serving as a deterrent for black money and counterfeiting.

&gt;* Blueprints that had been compiled at the Friday sessions were shared as soon as the move was announced with enforcement agencies like the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate, which handles financial crimes.Sources say that Dr Raghuram Rajan, who was RBI Governor, was part of the discussions between May and August, when his term ended and Mr Patel replaced him.Sources claim that there was a minor delay in the printing of the new 2,000-rupee notes because of the change in leadership.

New Delhi:  
  Three hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi used a television speech to announce that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would be abolished at midnight, the board of the Reserve Bank of India had cleared the ban.



RBI Governor Urjit Patel is meeting today with a second parliamentary committee to explain the sequence of events that resulted in November 8's shock demonetisation drive. 



Mr Patel told the Public Accounts Committee that the central bank's board, which is headed by him, met at 5.30 pm that evening and cleared the government's advisory note, sent a day earlier, on outlawing high-denomination bills.



On Wednesday, he testified for parliament's Finance Committee. The accounts he presented today and then show that though the government and the RBI began discussing demonetisation in May last year, it was on November 7 that plans kicked into action at breakneck speed for 24 hours.



While the RBI board was looking at the plan to make 500- and 1,000-rupee notes illegal, the PM had his cabinet waiting in his office from 7 pm onwards. The ministers were not allowed cellphones -a decision first introduced in July for cabinet meetings. Sources said that the Prime Minister's Office staff as well as the Finance Ministry team that knew what was coming were on edge as they waited for news from the RBI's board, which was meeting in Delhi.



Then arrived the message that the government's proposal had been unanimously cleared by eight of the RBI'S board which has 10 members. Right after that, PM Modi drove from his home to his office and disclosed his huge reform to the cabinet, which formally reviewed the notes ban as its agenda, and okayed it. At 8.00 pm, the Prime Minister was on air addressing the country.



That is when India was told that 86 per cent of the money in circulation, adding up to 15.44 lakh crores, was no longer valid for transactions.



The RBI says it was ready. Eight of its 10 board members had cleared the proposal in Delhi. A ninth was abroad. A tenth was in the central bank's Mumbai headquarters, assigned to coordinate the immediate implementation of one of India's biggest-ever economic decisions.



Top sources say that while the final push was a sprint, the planning for the notes ban was not casual or rushed. They since that starting in May, the RBI chief and a Deputy Governor would fly down to Delhi regularly to meet with an as-yet-undisclosed team compiled  by PM Modi from the Finance Ministry and his own office.



The meetings, held nearly every Friday after 6 pm, were detailed planning sessions that also tried to gauge and prepare for the consequences of the notes ban. The need for secrecy meant that minutes of the meeting were not recorded.



Mr Patel has told parliamentary panels that the RBI agreed with the government's assessment of the notes ban serving as a deterrent for black money and counterfeiting. Blueprints that had been compiled at the Friday sessions were shared as soon as the move was announced with  enforcement agencies like the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate, which handles financial crimes.



Sources say that Dr Raghuram Rajan, who was RBI Governor, was part of the discussions between May and August, when his term ended and Mr Patel replaced him.  



Sources claim that there was a minor delay in the printing of the new 2,000-rupee notes because of the change in leadership. The decision to introduce the new high-denomination note had reportedly been taken in June to ensure that once the old notes were banned, replacements were ready. The Prime Minister and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had allegedly cleared the new design and security features. The new bills needed the RBI Governor's signature, so the printing of notes was held up till Mr Patel took office. All other requirements were in place - as soon as he took charge, his signature was cleared and the printing of notes began.



The RBI has been faulted by critics who say it failed to take charge of a move that allowed the country to hurtle into a major cash shortage with little clarity on guidelines for banks and people.  But the RBI Governor has offered the details here to prove that the central bank was not just in the know, but performed its role through several months of preparation.

According to him, Jallikattu is not a sport, it is a ""brutal and wanton"" torture of an animal and that since holding Jallikattu is not permissible under law after the Supreme Court order, even supporting or encouraging it is defiance of the Supreme Court order.

 By Saritha Rai 

 

 Apple Inc. is willing to start making iPhones in India, but it wants a big helping hand from Narendra Modi’s government first.  

 

  The Cupertino, California-based company is scheduled to meet with officials in New Delhi next week to discuss the prospects for setting up manufacturing facilities in the country this year. Apple, the most valuable company on Earth, is asking for a long list of financial concessions from India, one of the poorest countries. Among the requests, the company is seeking a 15-year tax holiday on imports of components and equipment, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  

 

  ""We would like Apple to set up base in India,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for information technology said on Wednesday, without disclosing the company’s negotiating stance.  

 

  Apple wants to boost business in India as the country of 1.3 billion becomes the fastest-growing smartphone market and sales flatten in the U.S. and China. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited the country for the first time in May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores. India has insisted that Apple, like any single-brand retailer, source 30 percent of its components locally, though the country is relaxing those rules so technology companies can operate stores for three years before meeting that requirement.  

 

  Still, Apple wants more. The company has sent a list of requests ahead of its Jan. 25 meeting with officials from several government departments, including Electronics and Commerce, the person said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Apple is also asking for a waiver on customs duties for new and used equipment brought into India. The Indian Express newspaper reported Apple wants full exemption from duties on raw materials, components and capital equipment. Apple won’t insist on getting everything on its wish list, the person said. Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment.  

 

  The company doesn’t manufacture devices itself, but rather partners with contract manufacturers to handle the capital intensive demands of building factories and hiring staff. One surprise in India is that Apple plans to partner with Taiwan’s Wistron Corp. rather than Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., its usual manufacturing source, according to the person. Assembly of iPhones could start at Wistron’s existing facility in the suburbs of Bangalore, the person said. The work may be expanded to other suppliers including Hon Hai later, depending on demand, the person said.  

 

  Apple and India’s officials have met several times amid a prolific exchange of correspondence, but next week’s meeting will be crucial. If the government gives in to Apple’s demands, it may have to offer similar incentives to other global brands, such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp.  

 

  “Historically, the government has given no such concessions to any other company and there is no room in the policy to do so,” said Anshul Gupta, the Mumbai-based research director at Gartner Inc. “What Apple is asking for is outside the trend so it will be interesting to see how the government looks at it.”  

 

  India isn’t the only country pressing Apple for local manufacturing. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to see iPhones made in Apple’s home market, part of a broader push to get companies to keep or create manufacturing jobs. Hon Hai has said that it is in preliminary discussions to broaden its investment in the U.S.  

 

  Prime Minister Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his “Make in India” policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. His administration doesn’t want technology companies to sell products and take advantage of its vast consumer base without making their own capital investments.  

 

  Despite its global success, Apple is a minor player in India, largely because its phones are too expensive for local consumers. Apple holds about 2 percent of the market in a country where about 500 million smartphones are expected to be sold in the next few years. Samsung Electronics Co. and local player Micromax Informatics Ltd. are the leaders, thanks largely to their low-cost devices. For Apple, setting up manufacturing and retailing facilities could make the devices cheaper and help fuel growth. Cook has said Apple is just “scratching the surface” in India.

NEW DELHI: India ""has a lot more than cricket"", which is why other sports need to be encouraged and talent needs to be spotted right down at the district level, said Prime MinisterNarendra Moditoday.



""Only providing infrastructure is not enough, a conducive environment is very important for sports, something that cricket has in India. But India has a lot more than just cricket. We need to map sports persons at District level to identify talent,"" Modi said in a video address to a conference of ministers and secretaries of tourism, culture, youth affairs and sports.



The PM also talked about the country's demographic dividend and the need to harness this creatively to make a better India.



""Cutting across lines we need to realise how the power of youth can be materialised to make a better India as our majority population is below 35 (years of age),"" he said.



The young in India have already done a lot to improve the country and their efforts are evident in theSwachh Bharat Mission.



""A digital movement in the nation is going on and the youth are at the core of this. Our youth gave strength to Swachh Bharat Mission too,"" Modi said.



The PM talked about how having ""a sense of pride in the country"" can go a long way in advancing not just sports, but also every other sphere of development.



""We can have great impact on the world with our vast cultural heritage, if we have a sense of pride for it. As far as tourism is concerned, India is blessed with so much potential and this can draw the world to India."" Modi said.



The best way to harness this potential is to ""maximise output while minimising costs"" when promoting tourism, he said.



""Everything ranging from the varieties of music and food is a part of our cultural heritage which have to be put across to the world...if we work towards targeted development we can maximise output while minimising costs. Each state should pick a few destinations and create world class tourism infrastructure and draw the world there,"" the PM said.



In addition to attracting tourists from abroad, inter-state tourism should also be encouraged, Modi said.



""We have started with 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' event to promote inter-state tourism in country,"" Modi said.

461,"What Went Down In The Hours Before PM Narendra Modi's Notes Ban Speech

---

&gt;* Right after that, PM Modi drove from his home to his office and disclosed his huge reform to the cabinet, which formally reviewed the notes ban as its agenda, and okayed it.

&gt;* At 8.00 pm, the Prime Minister was on air addressing the country.That is when India was told that 86 per cent of the money in circulation, adding up to 15.44 lakh crores, was no longer valid for transactions.The RBI says it was ready.

&gt;* A tenth was in the central bank's Mumbai headquarters, assigned to coordinate the immediate implementation of one of India's biggest-ever economic decisions.Top sources say that while the final push was a sprint, the planning for the notes ban was not casual or rushed.

&gt;* The need for secrecy meant that minutes of the meeting were not recorded.Mr Patel has told parliamentary panels that the RBI agreed with the government's assessment of the notes ban serving as a deterrent for black money and counterfeiting.

&gt;* Blueprints that had been compiled at the Friday sessions were shared as soon as the move was announced with enforcement agencies like the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate, which handles financial crimes.Sources say that Dr Raghuram Rajan, who was RBI Governor, was part of the discussions between May and August, when his term ended and Mr Patel replaced him.Sources claim that there was a minor delay in the printing of the new 2,000-rupee notes because of the change in leadership.

&gt; Are you serious?
&gt; 
&gt; DO you actually believe that an average Indian farmer is as rich and has the same access to resources and raw material as a Western one?

Okay, I was talking about equality in rights not in outcomes. Like how Dhoni and a random kid get the same field but they have a very different skill level.

And by the way, the reason why India is a major food producer is in part because Indian labour is cheaper and since in India the cost of living is lower so the farmer can sell his produce for less.

&gt; Reasonable tariffs also prevent monopolies and deflation. Even the most libertarian free trade apologists think that that is a bad idea.

This is making little sense as tarrifs as tarrifs help to cause monopolies by stopping me from buying products from foreign competitors. Tarrifs cause inflation by decreasing the purchasing power of money (I can buy less foreign products or I have to switch to more expensive indigenous products). Excess inflation is not good, nor is deflation.

Since tarrifs contract the economy overall (that's why it causes inflation), it is more optimal to simply print money to avoid deflation.

&gt; Good grief. The term 'rich farmer' is a bit of an oxymoron in India.

Fine, if all farmers are poor why do farmers especially deserve help at the cost of other poor people? Food tarrifs are regressive as poor people spend a larger portion of their income on food.

Why not just redistribute money directly from the rich to the poor? Free trade is Kaldor-Hicks efficient so it's more optimal to have free trade (better overall) and redistribute the gains.",2017-01-20 21:47:44

Jaipur:  Opportunities, not reservation, is what's needed, said a top leader of the BJP's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS today, which is likely to cause the party some burn, given that key states including Uttar Pradesh vote in the next few weeks. Manmohan Vaidya, a top ideologue of the RSS, said at the Jaipur Literature Festival today that reservation protects those who were ""given a raw deal socially"" but in time, ""everyone should get equal opportunity"" and till that happens, ""a feeling of disparity or alienation"" is a risk.



His comments were followed by that of the organisation's Dattatreya Hosabale, who stressed that ""caste-based reservation is a necessity for some more time and reservation shall continue.""



In 2015, comments by the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, calling for a review of existing reservation policies, were estimated to have hurt the BJP ahead of the election in Bihar, which it lost. Like then, it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is the face of his party's campaign in Uttar Pradesh.



The BJP is up against the incumbent Samajwadi Party of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, Dalit icon who heads the Bahujan Samaj Party or BSP and has served as Chief Minister four times. In the general election, the BJP swept the state, winning 72 of a possible 80 seats.



Mayawati said the statement re-examining reservation ""is highly condemnable."" Lalu Yadav, among the coalition leaders who defeated the BJP in Bihar, said the new remarks on reservation would deliver another drubbing in Uttar Pradesh.



Later, both RSS leaders in Jaipur clarified, ""As long as there is discrimination, reservation as provided by the constitution should continue and the RSS supports it.""



The Jats of Western Uttar Pradesh, who form 17 per cent of the population in the region, have said that they will withdraw the support they extended to the BJP in the general election because the party has not added them to the caste-based groups eligible for reserved government jobs and seats in educational institutions.



In Gujarat, which has been governed by the BJP for over a decade, the powerful Patels say they must also be guaranteed a share of caste-based quotas for jobs and colleges. The Patels, originally a wealthy land-owning community that expanded into diamond trading and textiles, say that reservation policies, meant to benefit lower castes and tribal communities, have deprived them of the opportunities allowed by affirmative action to lower castes.

The RBI’s endorsement of the government action has drawn strong criticism from several former policymakers, including former PM Manmohan Singh, the architect of the 1991 financial reforms and a former central bank governor. (Reuters)

The government pushed ahead with its decision to scrap banknotes even as the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) own board expressed concern whether the cash could be replaced quickly enough, the central bank has said in written testimony to Parliament.

The revelation comes amid growing criticism about whether the central bank and the government had sufficiently assessed the potential fallout from the November 8 ban of about 86% of the cash then in circulation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock move caused a severe cash shortage that brought large parts of the economy to a virtual standstill, as the central bank struggled to print new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes to replace the old currency.

A copy of the private testimony to a panel, seen by Reuters, showed the central bank had also warned the government of “possible inconvenience to the public for some time”, among the potential consequences of the massive exercise.

Despite its own doubts, the testimony showed, the RBI board approved the plan to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, as it believed the move would rein in counterfeiting and reliance on cash, and pull unaccounted cash into the financial system.

“It might not immediately be possible to replace these notes fully in terms of both value and volume,” the board felt at a meeting ahead of Modi’s November 8 announcement, according to the central bank submission.

But the RBI’s board ultimately believed that “corrective” action could be taken and decided to recommend the move, the document showed. The RBI also believed the impact of such an exercise would be “transitory”, given its efforts to quickly replace the old notes, it said in the testimony.

The RBI’s endorsement of the government action has drawn strong criticism from several former policymakers, including former PM Manmohan Singh, the architect of the 1991 financial reforms and a former central bank governor.

The document also notes the proposal to ban the cash had come from the government, in a letter a day before the announcement that advised the RBI to “immediately” put the plan before its board for approval.Under India’s RBI Act, such a move was necessary.

The central bank did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments on its submission to parliament.

Since Modi declared the ban, the central bank has been forced to announce a barrage of measures to soften the impact, including several high-profile reversals, undermining confidence in it.

In a letter to RBI governor Urjit Patel, unions of central bank employees called such criticism “painful”, and accused the government of steering decisions behind the replacement of the banned notes, saying that “blatantly encroaches” on the central bank’s jurisdiction.

The government, however, has denied it was taking the decisions during the implementation, saying that it was merely cooperating with the RBI and reiterating that it fully respected the autonomy of the central bank.

Power and coal minister Piyush Goyal said such cooperation was necessary, since it involved an unprecedented “exercise” and that the flurry of action showed India’s flexibility in taking the necessary measures.

“They never had got an experience of this kind of a war-type situation,” Goyal said, referring to the RBI. “So, every organisation which is doing this is doing it for the first time. You will learn as you go along.”

Previous banknote bans have not had such a dramatic impact as they removed only a small fraction of cash from circulation.

Where was the discussion then? In Modi's house? 

&gt;I don't think you understand what the verb ""may"" means.

Yeah, anyone who thinks what you aren't thinking is wrong. You have a hard time accepting that there is a chance that the RBI central board was not involved in the discussions and only was brought in at the last moment and then Modi strong armed Urjit and they then strong armed the board. It is very convenient to say that don't even have any minutes of any of the meeting. Don't act blind. 

&gt;I didn't say that there were other people who were conducting the meetings.

You did say that there could have been 'other' meetings. You don't even know about central board meetings, what do you even know about these 'other' meetings. Accept when things aren't clear.

Of course it is hard to believe. But given the way the exercise has been conducted, the way the information is being withheld, there is something definitely fishy. The government doesn't really have a great track record with telling the truth. 

I don't know man. Today's news seem more credible. 

From http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rbi-says-it-recommended-demonetisation-of-rs-500-rs-1000-notes-on-governments-advice/articleshow/56443213.cms:

&gt;n a 7-page note to Parliament's Department-Related Committee of Finance headed by Congress leader M Veerappa Moily, the RBI stated that the government had on November 7, 2016 ""advised the Reserve Bank that to mitigate the triple problems of counterfeiting, terrorist financing and black money, the Central Board of the Reserve Bank may consider withdrawal of the legal tender status of the notes in high denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.""

&gt;The RBI's Central Board met the very next day to ""consider the government's advice"" and after ""deliberations"" decided to ""recommend to Central Government that the legal tender status of the banknotes in the high denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 be withdrawn.""

Multiple sources are saying the same thing. 

Also, this

http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/cleared-rs-2000-note-in-may-no-talk-then-on-500-1000-rbi-demonetisation-rti-reply-4467228/

&gt;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that its Central Board approved the proposal to issue new notes of the denomination of Rs 2,000 as early as May 2016, a fact it mentions in its note to the Standing Committee on Finance, **but adds that there was no discussion on a possible withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes at its board meetings in May or July or August.**
In its Right to Information (RTI) reply to an application filed by The Indian Express, the RBI said the Central Board discussed and approved the proposal to introduce Rs 2,000 notes on May 19 last year.

Hence the claim of Modi that the preparations were being done for 10 months is thrown out of the planet. 

This is the whole issue I have apart from the bad implementation. However good the intentions are, things need to be done by the procedure. If the government actually strong armed RBI to do this, they very well overstepped their powers as stated in the constitution and it needs to be investigated and people need to be made accountable and punished.

484,"&gt; Why would the introduction of higher-denominated notes be a bad thing?

Rajan's RBI perhaps wanted these more for the purposes of countering inflation. Higher denominations are a very clear indicator of inflation, and too much inflation is an indicator of a weaker purchasing power and an uncertain future, impacting investments and savings, and leading to massive bubbles. A ""healthy"" amount of inflation is typically desired by economists, around 4-5%. There was clearly a big conflict between Modi and Rajan on adjusting the inflation rate and the interest rate, because doing so would mean acknowledgement of a weaker rupee and weaker global economic footprint for the govt, which would be a political loss. 

It's no coincidence that Rajan was ousted and replaced with a mute lapdog, and soon after under the guise of black money/fake money/digital/cashless/add-your-buzzword-here, the govt introduce 2000 rupees as a replacement for 1000. This insidious move of basically pushing a higher denomination to account for the weaker rupee went largely unnoticed, as the PR machinery was in full swing and people were in full queues.
