1,"&gt; Too many to even count

You just gave two.

And lets see whose behind the riots shall we ? 

Vadodara riots :

&gt;**The riots reportedly flared up after an image, perceived as being offensive to Islam, was shared on Facebook**, Reuters reported, citing an official. [Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/race-riots-western-indian-city-vadodara-lead-police-arrest-140-people-1696257)

Take a guess who started the riots. And it wasnt riots exactly - just mostly muslims vs police.

Delhi riots :

&gt;""When I told them they couldn't drink near the chowki, they hit me and cut my scalp,"" Deepu said, claiming that at least some of the men were Muslims.

&gt;""They then ran towards the mosque and started stoning the chowki."" 

&gt;In the ensuing confusion, Naidu said, the donation box placed before the idols was stolen. [Source](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/toilets-temples-and-the-trilokpuri-riots/20141028.htm)

Guess who were the stone throwers ?

&gt;but law and order problems just find Modi wherever he is somehow.

TIL no riots existed before Modi.",2015-03-28 00:11:04
2,"I'll piggy back on the most reasonable answer here.

Add to that, of the educated, internet-savvy lot, the crude demographic we see here, which is in no way representative of India's demographic over all --- within this demographic there is a significant chunk that was/is supporting the message that AAP is sending out. There is also a similar and complementary other-half which supports BJP/Modi. As such, these are the only two that the sub at large identifies with (with the exception of the stray SS supporter, ahem ahem.)",2015-03-28 00:16:17
3,"Ok I'm on a computer now, and no, the only narrative I'm trying to follow is peace. 

Vadodara riots

http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/police-arrest-150-for-vadodara-communal-riots/1/393386.html

&gt;The violence reportedly broke out after the images of Hindu Goddess Maa Ambe and Lord Ram superimposed over Mecca's religious shrine went viral on the internet. The violence coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US.

&gt;Communal tension has been prevailing in Gujarat ever since the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) asked the state government to issue a directive preventing Muslims from entering the places where garbas are organised. The VHP even stated that if the BJP government did not pay heed to it, the outfit would on its own initiate action to ensure Muslims did not attend garba events.

Delhi riots

http://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/toilets-temples-and-the-trilokpuri-riots-114102701414_1.html
&gt;""A public dustbin had been installed in the vacant spot and the Muslims used to park all their vehicles there. At Eid, they would sacrifice animals,"" said Sujata Naidu, a Block 20 resident, ""We removed the dustbin and put up the chowki to keep the place clean.""

&gt;Naidu said Sunil Vaidya, the Bharatiya Janata Party's former MLA from Trilokpuri, had encouraged them to set up the chowki, a stone's throw from the local mosque, and assured them of his support in getting permissions from authorities. The chowki was supposed to stand for 40 days till October 31.

So tell me, who do you think is responsible for the riots, and how exactly are these incidents not a direct fault of what was set in motion 25 years ago by Modi and his party mates? They let the VHP and hateful elements in the BJP run free, incite hate all over the internet and the country, without the BJP led govt (in power in both of these places at the time of the incidents) as much as batting an eyelid about it. How is it wrong to call a spade a spade?",2015-03-28 01:10:11

Lower castes have also been historically been discriminated against, I wonder why the government formed a law banning caste discrimination, they were already getting discriminated against. What was the point? Yes that is what your ridiculous argument sounds like.

&gt;No. It is actually people like you who directly bring bad name to India! Its like, if sepoys had not registered to fight for the british, they would not have ruled over India for 200 years. Rapes happen everywhere, which is sad. You are wanting to make it sound like modi wants rapes in India...Is this really not what you meant? f*ck you for being a dishonest person.

Really, we are sepoys? Good generalization! Just because we are against a dickhole move of the government because everything is a conspiracy!


Dude, if you really want to compromise on India's democratic integrity for developmental goals, I think the only way is an authoritarian regime that is well guided like Singapore with good trampling of all the liberty we have. Seriously. Ridiculous arguments.

Exactly -  some hindooo internet warrior puts something on the fucking facebook and muslims start rioting on the street for that ? What different did I say that you have to quote a long ass post ?

&gt;""We removed the dustbin and put up the chowki to keep the place clean.""

WTF man ? Do you even read your sources ? Wanting to keep the location clean is now a crime ?

&gt;So tell me, who do you think is responsible for the riots,

Muslims. Your own sources tell that. If you had read through them you would have known that.

&gt;and how exactly are these incidents not a direct fault of what was set in motion 25 years ago by Modi and his party mates?

Are you insane ? Modi wasn't even on the scene 25 years ago. And you are a kid who doesn't have an iota of knowledge on the Hindu-muslim relation in India if you think everything started with 1992. 

Hint : It didnt. I'm not even going to go into the bad blood in north india because of the invasions and shit, but in more modern context, it has always been there since Partition. Huge ass, deadly month long riots have occurred in the 60s, 70s, 80s well before the ""25 years"".  Stop being this ignorant. It hurts.

And while we are the topic - since you consider that muslims are in the right to retaliate when shit is allegedly flinged at them, you must also be cool with hindus retaliating when 59 of their women and children were burnt in cold blood in a train right ? Or that is also somehow the fault of Hindus and muslims were the victims then ? That only muslims can be victims and hindus are perpetually the aggressors ? It is because of this pseudo-secularism shit and rationalizing the muslim violence that BJP won one of the biggest victories in modern electoral history and people still aren't learning.

&gt;hey let the VHP and hateful elements in the BJP run free, incite hate all over the internet 

Let me get this right - so you are not for free-speech and you want content regulated over the internet because it hits in the feels ?

Let us agree to disagree. Rest assured Delhi, among others, is a good example that the communal stuff is not a vote-getter for BJP in net terms. The states where it won in the last year, from Maharashtra to Jharkhand, nowhere did Hindutva or communal polarization figure as a factor.

&gt;Yet it's vote share remained unchanged. AAP in grew at the expense of other parties, not the BJP.

If AAP weren't there as an alternative to Congress much of that voteshare would have gone to the BJP. By providing a 'secular' alternative to Congress and other traditional parties AAP grew at the expense of the Modi-led BJP.

&gt;How did BJP manage to win the LS elections if most of it's support comes from the liberal middle class which constitutes a tiny part of the electorate?

BJP's support in the LS polls came from secular Hindus in general. You'd have to be deluded to think they won because of Hindutva.

78,"I found it pretty disgusting at first but I get their point now. Menstruation is something 50% of our population has gone/will go/goes through, but it's still a pretty taboo thing for large sections of the society. Fact is, men need to know about it so that in the future as fathers, they're sensitive to the issue. It needs to come outside in open discussion so that educational campaigns about sanitary napkin use can be conducted without the fear of backlash.

We're all whining about it because we're educated enough to know about menstruation, but most of our country isn't. It's only when menstruation is a comfortable discussion matter that policies will be openly made and debated which will help that section of our country.

For those comparing it to pissing or shitting, you need to understand that if those was as 'hushed up' in our society as menstruation is then things like [Modi's speech on the importance of toilets](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Bill-Gates-lauds-Modi-for-talking-about-toilets/articleshow/44593719.cms) wouldn't be possible. Subsequently, education and infrastructure development plans regarding sanitation would maybe not come to the forefront of policy debate. Thankfully tackling the menstruation issue doesn't require infrastructure but it does require education and awareness. There are plenty of health problems related to menstruation which can seriously effect women.

132,"Copy-pasting the article as it is behind a paywall

&gt;In the wake of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s overwhelming victory in 2014, exit polls suggested that his success was due largely to widespread disillusionment with the United Progressive Alliance, the center-left coalition that had ruled the country since 2004. Throughout the campaign, Modi had positioned his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the vanguard of good governance and economic dynamism—a stark contrast, he hoped, to the coalition’s record of corruption and slow growth. Since assuming office, Modi has taken steps to differentiate himself from his predecessors, particularly with his second budget, which promises to improve the country’s infrastructure and remove bottlenecks in the energy sector. The most remarkable feature of his time in office so far, however, has been his engagement in a realm he scarcely mentioned during the campaign: foreign policy.

&gt;Modi has brought tremendous energy and dexterity to foreign policy in his brief tenure in office. Although it has not yet been a full year since his election, Modi has already visited a dozen countries, ranging from those in India’s neighborhood to some as far away as Australia and Brazil. Perhaps most significant, he has jump-started the bilateral relationship between India and the United States. In a remarkable departure from tradition, Modi hosted U.S. President Barack Obama as the chief guest at India’s Republic Day Parade on January 26. The invitation was highly symbolic: it was the first time a sitting American president had been accorded that honor.

&gt;For far too long, India has punched well below its weight in the global arena. Modi’s activism may thus be a sign that he is ready for a new era of Indian foreign policy, reflecting a belated willingness to engage with the world on a host of pressing bilateral and multilateral issues. In his visits to Mauritius, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka, for example, he has proffered security assistance, promised developmental aid, and promoted trade expansion—efforts that appear designed to counterbalance China’s influence in the region. Beyond India’s immediate shores, Modi has reached out to Australia, Japan, and the United States to boost existing security ties. Before Obama’s visit, Modi personally intervened to change India’s stance on a trade dispute that had deadlocked the Doha Round of global trade negotiations. During Obama’s visit, he sought to settle areas of discord between India and the United States, such as the fraught U.S.-Indian civil nuclear accord.

&gt;Despite Modi’s best efforts, however, domestic developments in India threaten to jeopardize his foreign policy initiatives. Even as he courts foreign leaders with grace, projecting professional cosmopolitanism, his government has tolerated, even abetted, a dangerous, parochial social agenda at home.

&gt;The first signs of such parochialism came in the early days of Modi’s prime ministership. In June 2014, Modi appointed a relatively unknown historian, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, to the Indian Council of Historical Research, a government agency that awards grants and fellowships to Indian and foreign scholars. Rao, among other controversial views, believes that the two Hindu religious epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, should be considered historically truthful, even in the absence of suitable archaeological evidence. In January 2015, at the annual meeting of the Indian Science Congress, in Mumbai, several scientists made similarly absurd claims. Among them: that Indian physicians had pioneered plastic surgery several thousand years ago, that helicopters had existed in ancient India, and that an Indian aviator had flown a heavier-than-air craft nearly a decade before the Wright brothers.

&gt;These statements can be dismissed as the fantasies of hypernationalist cranks and charlatans. But other developments cannot be so easily ignored, and they threaten to unravel the delicate social fabric of India’s secular order. The most disturbing of these is the emergence of the ghar wapsi, or “return home,” movement. This effort, the brainchild of various BJP-affiliated organizations, most notably the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), seeks to convert members of other faiths to Hinduism. It has targeted mainly poor and working-class minorities. According to the Deccan Chronicle, an English-language Indian newspaper, at least 8,000 people in the southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been converted to Hinduism under the aegis of the program. The irony of this endeavor is lost on Hindu zealots: Hinduism, unlike Christianity or Islam, does not believe in proselytization, meaning that the very notion of conversion is anathema to the faith. Despite this inherent contradiction, the effort is well under way and has generated abject fear in the minority Christian and Muslim communities. The ecclesiastic leadership of both communities has begged Modi to end the program, but the prime minister has evinced scant interest in the matter.

&gt;More disturbing, the country has seen an uptick in religious violence, particularly in attacks on churches. In the past six months, eight churches have been attacked. Five of these took place in New Delhi, India’s capital, yet it took till mid-February for Modi to publicly condemn them. Despite the prime minister’s belated reassurances, members of the Christian community remain fearful. In an op-ed in The Indian Express, published March 17, 2015, Julio Ribeiro, a retired Christian police officer, expressed his anxiety about India’s tide of intolerance toward minorities. He wrote that he was beginning to feel like a stranger in his own country.

&gt;These episodes alone are sufficiently disquieting in a country of extraordinary religious and cultural diversity. But the outrageousness does not stop there. The activist Vijaykant Chauhan, for example, has launched a campaign in the densely populated state of Uttar Pradesh to prevent what he refers to as “love jihad,” or marriages between Muslim men and Hindu women. His campaign cannot be dismissed as that of a fanatic; it should be understood, instead, as part of a larger effort by a segment of Modi supporters to fashion a new social order. In their worldview, India’s minorities can exist only at the sufferance of the Hindu majority. During his campaign, Modi relied heavily on the grass-roots efforts of far-right organizations such as the RSS. Now these groups are asserting their claim to influence the country’s direction and ideology.

&gt;As Obama said in a recent speech delivered in New Delhi, however, India can ill afford this descent into religious intolerance. What’s more, Modi has little political future if his policies remain Janus-faced. On the one hand, he has actively and adroitly sought to engage the world. On the other, he appears willing to tolerate religious hatred and bigotry at home. In so doing, Modi hopes to straddle two markedly different constituencies: the first, sophisticated and cosmopolitan; the second, prejudiced and parochial. Thus far, Modi has managed to maintain this delicate balance. But things could easily get out of hand. For example, if a sectarian riot were to erupt in a major city, and the government were to be indifferent to the plight of the afflicted minority, Modi might be forced to relive his past. (In 2002, when he was chief minister of the western Indian state of Gujarat, ethnic riots in his state killed some 2,000 Muslims.)

&gt;Put simply, his juggling act cannot last. As India’s disturbing domestic developments swiftly draw global attention, Modi will find it impossible to sequester one realm from another. A government that is committed to promoting economic development, attracting foreign investment, and integrating India’s markets with the world is simply incompatible with one that allows intolerance to sweep unchecked across the nation.",2015-03-29 21:42:37

**Edit:** Since you deleted your earlier comment, I'll append my reply here.

Nopes, but the cost does grow. And there's corruption in the system. Nothing that Kejriwal can't handle./s

Btw, if you want the *real reason*, it's that they did not prepare a budget, and therefore don't have the bureaucratic basis to request funds from the Center. And in the vote-on-account, they did not allocate anything to MCD (spent instead on subsidies.) Center pays Delhi Gov, and Delhi Gov pays MCD. That's the chain, and it is initiated by a formal request. And Kejriwal did not play any role in the vote-on-account, so he simply doesn't know why MCD allocation wasn't made.

Remember when they got elected and they went to Modi? One of the points they told the press was that they asked for money. The reply they got was please make the request, allocations will be made. (They were always made even when Congress was ruling Center and State, with BJP in the civic bodies. Politicians do not fuck around with civic amenities.) Well, they fucked up, and basically did NOT make the formal request.

Btw, have you heard any reports that say ""the Center refuses to give Delhi Gov money?"" You haven't. That's because they were not refused, they just never asked.

174,"&gt;Very true, furthermore the similarities extend to beyond ideals, its that they both advocate a top-down approach to economy and perhaps that was necessary at the time, but new technologies are making it more evident that decentralization is the way forward.

Bingo - This is precisely my issue, and OP inadvertently hit on a raw nerve :p

&gt;And I've read the Mckinsey and Accenture papers (are you a consultant by any chance?). 

Used to be, only so many years can somebody put in 15 hour days - wage slave as you would call it :p. More...relaxed job, but do consultancy for the logistics sector, hence get access to and have to read reams of data. My industry is both capital intensive as well as requires substantial lead time to build capacity and hence we study current data rather extensively.

&gt;I realize that new emerging markets will require both labor and goods at an unprecedented scale. But my question is: will it be using the unsustainable methods that have resulted in the saturated developed world?

Of course they will use what you term unsustainable resources. Take Kenya for instance, they are now slowly building their own auto industry (right now, it is ALL imports driven, even the auto rickshaws on the streets of Nairobi are TVS / Bajaj ones and imported from India). Guess what? They don't have the capital to adopt the highly mechanised means you suggest. They are doing it the old fashioned way - assembly line, basic mechanisation, staffed with people.

Keep in mind, mechanisation is a need driven by a shortage of labour. When labour is in surplus and has very low rent, the natural outcome is to throw more labour at a problem till it goes away.

This is what the H-O model suggests and a lot of other models also do the same. Put it this way, when a contract labour comes at Rs 6k a month all inclusive, why would you invest in a machine that costs you even Rs 10 lakh? 

&gt;I don't think the Earth has resources for that. I would link an article here, but this view is commonly accepted.

Mineral resources? Africa to the rescue - she is untapped (for the most part). The ecology as a whole? Agree, but the question is, what else? When (not if) India and Africa and LatAm industrialise, we are going to chuck up a lot of ecological damage, but what is the trade off? People continue to die in poverty and penury? In the long run, welathier states have a better rate of protection of the environment so maybe...

&gt;Fair enough a decade is a good estimate. But I just don't want to see a situation where manufacturing in India has no purpose in job creation, even if it does wonders for the BOP. 

That is maybe because you start out with the assumption that it is all going to be mechanised. My assumption is, yes mechanisation will eventually happen, but as already covered above, labour is a surplus, and firms would prefer a lower Opex than a huge upfront Capex which needs to get ammortised. Jobs ARE going to be created, there will be a transfer of jobs from primary to secondary and it is long overdue.

&gt;It would be really screwed up for us to have those 900 mil people still not worth a shit, because Gates and Musk and the head of the Intl Labor Org think automation is highly likely.

It is still early days, let us not jump the gun yet. We still have a large window and let us exploit it as Modi wants to do.

Look at job creation in China, despite all this talk of 'automation' and wage rates reaching tipping point in China, they STILL add on average ~ 8-10 Mn jobs a YEAR, with a figure of ~ 12 Mn last year.

Do you think, things will change drastically over the next decade?

&gt;This is our core disagreement I think. You are of the opinion that we have these paradigmatic dichotomies to choose from, and that we are limited in our choice of economic moves. I suppose you have a better view of this than me, because I only studied Econ up to Masters and you sound like you've done more than that. But I really think the future will open up more avenues of thought and economic organization, and have in a way already. The blockchain, NOT bitcoin, come to mind.

Yes and we have to agree to disagree. Maybe people like me are just dinosaurs, but history (of economics) teaches me that the movement HAS to be Primary &gt; Secondary &gt; Tertiary. In my limited intellectual capacity (and even more limited studies / reading) I just don't see a way out. I could be wrong, heck I might just be 100% wrong, but I won't be convinced unless I see data, studies, theories that support your view. 

&gt;Whereas I think it would be more noble (and efficient) to give them some sort of dignified life where they are productive to themselves and society.

Let me throw some stark facts at you. 350 Mn Indians are on a borderline starvation diet. 300 Mn Indians aren't even connected to an electric grid. 600 Mn shit in the open. 40% of all the world's malnourished Children (more than SSA combined) are found in India.

Now compare the HDI increases (despite the environmental costs) in China - plot our HDI metrices (they weren't invented that time, but still am sure data of some form exists) from 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and see how India and China ran neck and neck till 1980 and see how the HDI indicies soared up for China with a near stagnation for India.

It already is annoying, scary and irksome that we missed a huge window thanks to Madame Soniaji (in case you missed it, I have a pathological hatred for her and MMS of the UPA era), the window is smaller, but it exists and so far Modi seems to be exploiting it.

We don't have oil, so we have to import it, but goddamn it if we need to import $ 50 Bn worth LED TV's. Worst come worse, that is $ 50 Bn saved in import costs and rights our BoP by that much allowing our government to be more profligate in social sector spending (which is highly needed btw - I am not a libertarian, free market proponent). India needs to be a statist economy, but for that we need money.

In a nutshell

1. After AAP's Delhi victory, founding members and idealogues Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were pissed that AAP had sacrificed some of their old principles and used dirty tactics to win the elections, such as fielding candidates with tainted records and ex-BJP/Congress defectors. The Kejriwal faction countered that such compromises were necessary for politics. 

2. There was also a view that AAP was becoming a one-man dictatorial party dominated by Kejriwal and a small coterie, and so in order to be Delhi CM he should resign as AAP's National Convener/Head Honcho.

3. The Kejriwal faction saw this as a threat to their leadership of the party and reacted brutally, publicly slandering Bhushan and Yadav and all party members who agreed with them.

4. Both sides traded barbs, allegations and sting tapes against each other for weeks, exposing much of the dirty inner workings of AAP and showing the public they weren't that different from other parties.

5. Finally Kejriwal has started purging AAP of anyone who can emerge as a rival and independent power centre and filling all party posts with his loyalists. Bhushan and Yadav and most of their supporters have been kicked out, other leaders have been warned to toe Kejriwal's line and even the party's Internal Lokpal was sacked and replaced when he complained(So much for independent Lokpals!).

6. Now AAP's Delhi government is making retarded decisions like cutting government salaries and infrastructure spending to pay for power and water subsidies and refusing funding to the BJP-run Municipal Corporations, because of which civic workers haven't been paid their salaries and are protesting by dumping garbage on Delhi streets.

7. The last straw is the Kejriwal government exploiting its authority to misuse public power and resources in the name of the party. eg. A government librarian who refused to lend books to AAP members(since rules say only govt officials can borrow the books) was transferred. The government now pays salaries for AAP goons to stand vigil at civic hospitals 'assisting' patients and threatening doctors and nurses to ensure there is proper treatment.

8. BTW by now AAP and its supporters have completely forgotten about the main reasons they used to fight for: Anti-corruption movement, Jan Lokpal Bill, Swaraj, Right to Recall etc. Their next agenda is to gherao Parliament in alliance with other Opposition parties like Congress, Janata Parivar, TMC etc. to attack the Modi government over the Land Bill. Already Mamata and Nitish Kumar have spoken to Kejriwal about a future alliance against BJP. 

So now AAP stands exposed. There is no clean politics, no independent Lokpal, no good governance. Just another party with a petty, dictatorial, power hungry, corrupt leader. Hence the anger.",2015-03-30 22:37:41
200,"Let me try to explain.

I was neutral towards them till they fought their first election. Since then my opinion has become increasingly negative about them. Today I don't like AAP. The reasons are many. One of the most important is their Randi rona attitude towards everything. No shades of grey, No nuanced stance. Hum imaandar, baaki sub chor.

Now with that background, if anyone tries to even argue (on internet or face to face in real life) about deficiencies in the party, he is immediately labelled as Bhakt, Sanghi, corrupt or whatever colorful. 

This type of behavior has very harshly alienated many people like me. At this point, I am very happy to see my prediction about this party come true. Yes, it even gives me a false ego boost. And internally I become happy when I see very hardcore AAP supporters slowly come down to earth and realize, one person/party is not the solutions to all ills of India. 

I have a good friend who is a staunch supporter of AAP. He has been oppressed a lot by the system. He had thrown all his fate with AAP. And become a idiot in supporting AAP. We are discussing electrical shortage in India and his only refrain will be that only Kejriwal will correct it as everybody else is corrupt and takes money from Electrical company. After some point, even non-political discussions started becoming toxic with retorts like ""Tere modi ne kya kar liya"". At one point I even starting avoiding this person. After PN and YO were thrown out, he has returned back to earth and calmed down a bit. 

Once this fanboism with AAP dies down, I think AAP will get on with governance in a better way. And when that happens, people like me will again go back to being neutral about AAP. I will like to judge them only after 4 years of work in Delhi. ",2015-03-30 22:43:02

I like how India has ""good"" relations with almost everyone except AQ, Taliban, Pakistan and China. It even has a [Navy base](http://www.aame.in/2013/02/indian-listening-station-in-oman.html) in Oman just off Gwadar, which is total genius. It's got good relations with Iran (thanks to [oil](http://cogitasia.com/india-iran-relations-a-balancing-act/) and [Afghanistan/anti-Taliban](http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/india-iran-and-the-west/)), Palestine, though its not as upbeat as before^[1](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.633564) ^[2](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delay-in-financial-aid-affecting-india-palestine-relations/article1-1304387.aspx), and [Israel](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/3/modi-israel-relations.html). The relationship with the KSA is kind of here and there, but (generally, I think) mutually beneficial. I mean, Jamnagar is the largest refinery in the world, and I'm guessing most of the crude that goes *into* Jamnagar comes from KSA. The Emir from Qatar just visited India last week, and India and Qatar already [have an established](http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publications/indian-ocean/29-indian-ocean-swa/1356-qatar-and-india-continue-to-strengthen-military-ties.html) diverse relationship.   
  
We have good relationships with Iraq (thanks to Saddam), Lebanon and Jordan. Jordan even offers visa-on-arrival for Indians. We have a [cordial relationship with Syria](http://www.syriadeeply.org/articles/2013/05/2331/deep-read-worlds-largest-democracy-handling-syria-issue/) (thanks in part to NAM, Iran and Russia), and almost everyone knows how far back the India-Egypt love story goes.  
  
I mean, that's just wonderful, right? I think being ""non-aligned"" actually ended up leading to India being friendly with everyone. We could easily have legitimate enemies in the Middle East now, and by that I mean entire countries could hate us (like they hate the United States), but we walked that tightrope of being not-white, not-rich and not-Muslim and I find that very pleasing.

When Amit Shah woke up and found Kejri's cult of personality growing like mad he gave in to pressure and brought Kiran Bedi who never had the experience or guts to get her hands dirty with politics. For all intents and purposes she seemed like Manmohan. BJP was so confident they refused the public debate. That was a big mistake. Amit shah is a very clever man. I am sure if he had worked his cards right this AAP debacle could have come 3 months earlier. But he was overconfident. Even in Bihar even though Sushil Modi is the most well known leader and best choice for CM candidate there are lot of veteran leaders ready to challenge him for the post.

They have already formed their conclusions, all they do every day is look for selective observations to reinforce it. 

2. There are vested interests at work. India has a large, well-developed support network for the left-liberal community that spans across political parties, educational institutions, NGOs and media. They all stand to suffer whenever a BJP government is in power anywhere in India, and especially at the Centre. 

For example I have journalist friends who make no bones of the fact that they are hardcore Congress supporters because the Congress party has long been wining and dining journalists, editors and media owners across India, paying for their vacations and junkets etc. and the BJP(especially under Modi, who has a grudge against the media for their coverage of Gujarat under his rule) does not mollycoddle them the same way.",2015-04-01 01:47:10

We have to understand one thing. Legally and for all practical purposes, your party affiliation only matters until election results are announced. Once you get appointed to a position, say PM, it stops mattering which party you're from. You always carry the burden of your predecessor.

And in a way, your predecessor's fuckups are what you based your election plank on to begin with! Modi won the elections saying he'll fix Congress' fuckups. Once elected, he is going about fixing things, not shirking them.

Similarly, AAP won elections saying that they will fix things. Now they have to deliver.

&gt;AAP can't fix 8 months

Nobody put that pressure on them. There are very normal ways and means by which (1) they can simply send one formal request for funds to the Center, and pay salaries, and then (2) let ACB loose on MCD's corruption and weed out all the bad elements. 

(1) is a routine step that every previous Delhi Gov has taken to bridge MCD funding gaps, and

(2) is a something no previous Delhi Gov had taken because they were *not* against corruption. AAP is against corruption, they have fixed a lot of bad elements in traffic police, DJB, and so on, they can easily remove corrupt elements from MCD.",2015-04-01 09:40:46

&gt; He insisted people’s welfare should be paramount when a policy is drafted and there should be a proper mechanism to receive feedback on the initiatives.

I was talking about this need for a feedback mechanism in [one](http://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/30sy6z/karnataka_assembly_passes_bill_to_hike_salary_of/cpvmsoz) of my comments. It's well and good that our PM is taking initiative on this front. But this shouldn't be one of those things that fizzles out on its way down the hierarchy. An efficient feedback system, that gives a unbiased picture of a minister's performance (or any elected person for that matter), would go a long way in solving many of our country's chronic problems.

&gt;The Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, who is on the second day of his roadshow in Delhi ahead of Lok Sabha elections, was shown black flags by a group of protesters in Geeta Colony, East Delhi, on Wednesday afternoon.

&gt;Two hours into the roadshow in East Delhi, as Kejriwal and East Delhi Lok Sabha candidate Rajmohan Gandhi reached Gandhi Nagar, a group of people wearing black bands waved black flags at the AAP cavalcade. One of the protesters identified himself as Narendra Mahajan and claimed to be a BJP supporter.

&gt;Engaging with the protesters, Kejriwal asked them if the BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi came to power, would they not be paying more for gas? He said if the public were going to pay less, he would join the BJP.

&gt;Minutes after the speech, Kejriwal clarified what he had meant. “Some BJP supporters had shown us black flags. I asked them that if the BJP came to power, will they have to pay less for gas? **I told them that if that was the case, then we too will join the BJP.** Some media channels are running *false stories that I have said I will join the BJP*.

So, when the MCD elections come - AAP can take control from BJP - People will never forget the stinking garbage on the roads - caused by BJP's MCD corruption.

b. Modi has the swach bharat abhiyan as his pet project - but AK has given one tight slap on that campaign now.

I actually thought about this. 
I think the flaw is that India's automobiles are a couple of things

1. Blended fuel use by many autos/taxis. Also some corrupt pump owners do this. Increases CO. basically CO more harmful (direct impact) than CO2.

2. faulty and deprecated catalytic converters. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter
Suggested measures....any and every repair shop must make sure the vehicle they touch (for any business purpose)*... will, at the end, have a three way catalytic converter.

3. Heavy traffic, congested roads.
Imagine how much lesser fuel would be required for an average delhiite if there were bigger roads/flyovers to reach home! Actually if the flyovers and roads were doubled, the travel time will reduce by 50% at least. That, will make sure your automobiles emit less CO and/or CO2.

4. Its not just Delhi. Even small places in India are having these problems.

I don't want to be campaigning for any one, but can't resist....
*This is also a reason Modi and BJP are best for India (at the moment). ""Sab Samasyaon ka Samaadhaan, debelopment hain!""*

310,"&gt;very smart of OP for not mentioning the NCV of the gas price which, **after the decrease was USD 5.18 mmbtu** when the pre-NDA price was USD 4.2 mmbtu.

Not sure what was 'smart' on his part considering that the net effect is anyway reduction of existing prices.

&gt;we can quibble about Kejriwal's statement and see whether he meant increase to USD 16 in one shot, or over 5 years

Ah, there comes the spin. ""Or over 5 years"". Its like ""free wifi*, conditions apply.

&gt;GSPC (95% owned by the Gujarat Govt) wrote the letter to the Central Govt asking for an increase to USD 14.20 (with Brent at USD 110 as per formula)

Not sure how relevant considering you yourself said it was just proposed and it was with a brent base price of $110. And it was just for one field (Deen Dayal West) and not across the board. Also Kejru's allegation was that Ambani would pressure Modi to raise the prices while GSPC was 95% owned by the Guj government.

&gt;The NDA increased the gas price to USD 5.62 per mmbtu in October, 2014

Very clever of you to not mention the gas pricing adopted by the government is actually 75% less when compared to the Rangarajan formula which was instituted by UPA.

So it was more like UPA instituted a panel to determing the gas pricing which recommended a formula that would cost almost double than that of NDA, but they were postponing it because of elections.

&gt;The NDA decreased the gas price to USD 5.16 per mmbtu in April, 2015

Good for us, no ?

&gt;The price decrease is effective for the next six months only.

So ?

&gt;RIL gets USD 5.16 per mmbtu on gas and makes a healthy profit 

So does every other gas producing company including ONGC,OIL. Infact in domestic production ONGC and OIL have a near monopoly and any govt decision on gas affects them far more than any other including RIL

The Modi govt was also a lot more silent vis-a-vis the media with a head down, work approach in a ""media doesn't like me anyway"" approach. In the absence of a PMO spokesperson and no set policy announcement focal point from the govt, Akbaruddin became the quasi de facto spokesperson. He has typically stayed away from non-MEA related discussions, yet has been assertive on multiple occasions in an articulate manner.

358,"&gt; Right wingers who admire Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew might be interested to know that in Singapore there are laws mandating that people from all communities are represented proportional to their population in govt housing. He firmly believed that taking everybody along was crucial to development.

A little bit of context to why the EIP (Ethnic Integration Policy) in HDB (Housing Development Boards) was taken up first introduced in 1989. 

In the 1960s, Singapore saw incidents of riots between Malays and Chinese - the foremost one being the [1964 riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore). Singapore was a part of Malaysia then. Tensions continued even after Singapore was separated from Malaysia, a year later, until the 70s. Post that Singapore was largely riot and (public) tension free. However, by the end of 1980s a trend emerged in the housing block allocations. People started living in Ghettos with *their* community/race. For example, between September 1987-1988; in the [Bedok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedok)/[Tampines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampines) zone 55% applicants for resale of HDB flats were Malays. In the same neighborhood, the population of Malays exceeded 30%. Similarly, the [Hougang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hougang) area consisted of 90% Chinese population. The Singapore govt and the then Minister of National Development - [Dhanabalan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Dhanabalan) - were alarmed at this *ghetto* mentality and stepped in to curb it (or ""nip it in the bud"" as Dhana said). The EIP suggests that if a block or neighborhood exceeds a preset racial limit then flats in that block/neighborhood can't be sold to the race. For example, if the HDB neighborhood was set a limit of 84% to Chinese - the moment the limit is crossed new flats couldn't be sold to the Chinese. These preset limits are revised every few years as and when required.


&gt; So if Modi wants to learn lessons from Singapore , I'd suggest that this would be a good start.

Modi has already moved in the opposite direction. Read up on the Gujarat Disturbed Areas, Act which prohibits the sale of properties in areas which are marked by the government as ""disturbed"". 40% of Ahmedabad comes as ""disturbed"" apparently. Most Muslim dominated ghettos like Juhupura come under this act making it really difficult for a minority to [sell property or engage in real estate transactions](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Saffron-brigade-halts-Muslim-realty-deals-in-Gujarat/articleshow/11907061.cms). In Vadodara, this has been [extended till 2019](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/disturbed-areas-act-extended-in-vadodara-till-2019-114100101416_1.html). I think 751 areas are under this act and overall has just led to the formation of more ghettos.
",2015-04-02 19:06:02

Another example would be Casinos in Singapore - *Gambling is not in our culture* to outgrossing the entire Las Vegas strip within 3 years of 2 casino launches.

The ""gujarat model"" is not something the BJP will implement on a national level any time soon, by the looks of it.

But the electoral reality in India is that the prosperity of poor people (the majority) is everything. If the cost of living for poor people goes up even slightly, anti-incumbency kicks in. This is something BJP always worries about.

From the looks of it all Modi government is doing so far is trying to establish strong, reliable institutions that people can use to their own advantage. 

Furthermore small government in totality would be disastrous in India, especially considering the poverty. The government needs to direct its efforts accurately, and address isolated, disparate, and varied issues that adversely effect the bottom 80% of the people. This while does require a certain amount of government interference, and therefore ""strong"" government, can only be addressed by establishing reliable institutions, and disbanding/using the authority of the government to dissolve corrupt practices within the government, and in external institution by auditing industries, and establishing/enforcing proper regulations. 

I honestly don't know exactly what Modi is doing, but a strong government does not necessarily imply big government.

They wont vote for PB/YoYa, even if they form a separate party. All they were doing is, seeing how the principles and dreams sold by AAP are turning into a farse and enjoying the show. The real backers for PB/YoYa are some of the AAP volunteers and leaders.

&gt;'principled'

This is the damage AK has done by his quest for power and absolute control. an AAP supporter like you quoting the word principle in quotes !

About the Tihar Jail, AK told in the NE meeting that he turned to PB whether to apply for bond or not, and PB nodded to him not to. AK will even go to singsing if he thinks that it will fetch him some votes.(mark of a true politician, and these days its difficult to find such commitment to politics/power  from other leaders)

412,"ITT: People analyzing where AK was right, and what went wrong. Or about PB - what is real motive etc.. Point of the matter is - it doesn't matter. 

AK does NOT want the AAP model, the swaraj model, the ""alternative politics"" - because he knows that will never get him 67/3. AK is after the minority and ""mein gareb hu - mujhe sab free mein chaiye"" vote - which can be attracted very easily by giving freebies, encouraging religion fear and shoot-first-think-later kind (in short drama baazi) politics. ""EVMS tamper ho gaye hain"", ""Modi is Adani agent - isliye price bhada dega"". 


&lt;rant&gt;

In short the ""gareeb aadmi"" mentality - wherein a fucking taxi driver - earning probably much more than a govt. teacher is cribbing ..""kya kar rahi BJP govt. Platform ticket bhada diya"". Idiot, god knows how many times he will go to a station in how many months - but nahi ..""rate increase hua na..matlab ye anti-poor govt. hain. garib aadmi mein ho...."" Saala, you are earning at least a couple of thousand per day (paying zero tax), in big metros, doing more rides because of better roads, more malls, etc.  but you will hate this govt. for that 5 rupees increase in platform ticket.  

&lt;/rant&gt;

I feel this is very bad news for both BJP and even Congress. Irrespective of what you think about either party and irrespective of their corruption levels - the point is do you want them or a megalomanic anarchist as your leader. 

Why am i afraid ? Simple logic. minority vote, Myopic BPL and pseudo-poor (""gareeb aadmi"" mentality) voters (who have no interest in long term development coming from anyone). 

Irrespective of all paralysis by arm-chair analysis that we do here, there is no stopping AK now, when the facade of clean politics has come off. He will not even try that anymore. It will be ALL like his speech at the National Convention. Just pure spite and hatred, targeted at someone. And as many people fell for it, even on this reddit - many many more will in the outside world.

421,"&gt;If you have been following Indian mass media or social media in the last few months, you couldn’t have escaped the narrative being spun by the Hindutva right-wing. It goes something like this: “Christianity is posing a growing and serious demographic threat to Hinduism by converting large  
numbers of Hindus through aggressive proselytising. This effort is heavily funded by Christian organisations in the West that see India as being ripe for large-scale conversions. Since proselytising and conversions are not part of Hindu tradition, or that of any religion that originated in India, the playing field is tilted against Hinduism, and this is causing serious societal friction. This sometimes leads to spontaneous and violent reactions.”


This might be the narrative in certain sections of Social Media (looking at you HDL and SuSu fans), but definitely not the one predominant in the main stream media. In fact, if you follow the MSM, you will get quite the opposite impression that under Modi govt, Hindutva elements have become emboldened and are oppressing and attacking minorities, esp christians.

The above open letter is typical slimy lawyer talk trying to convince you that PB is right. From what I've heard, he had issues with 12 candidates. All 12 were investigated by the lokpal and all except 2 were cleared. Now, does he think his opinion is more important than that of the lokpal? So important, that he will take a shit on the party if they don't listen to him?

Another point. His father was the one who said he would prefer Kiran Bedi and Ajay Maken over Arvind Kejriwal. Seriously? In any other party he would be thrown out on his ass within seconds.

Also regarding Kejriwal's insistence that this election was crucial for the AAP. Quite clearly it was. Imagine if the BJP won in Delhi this time. The AAP would definitely be finished. All the time, energy and resources spent by the AAP volunteers would be flushed down the drain. It would have been a demoralising body blow, one from which the party might have never recovered.

&gt; With ministers interminably waiting for instructions from the PMO and unwilling to stick their neck out, decisions are taking much longer. According to sources in the PMO, the highest number of files pending has gone up from 1,500 during Manmohan Singh’s tenure to 6,000 by mid-March “The prime minister, being a control freak and travel freak at the same time, compounds the problem,” says a former cabinet secretary.


&gt; Rhetoric is to be unleashed this month about the government’s achievements as it completes a year in office. The big claim is: Modi’s magic has left investors spellbound. The i&amp;b ministry is reportedly preparing 60 bilingual slides to highlight the success story of India, for the first time, being set to humble China’s growth. And to say this has been made possible by good governance, which has translated into solid work.

Also, the Jama Masjid demolition did not lead to the kind of rioting that happened in Gujrat.

I agree somewhat that it may not be a fair comparison, but that said you can not deny that BJP itself has a lot of corruption and it is neither fair to judge Narasimha Rao on the corruption that existed in the government at that time.

Also, as for his contribution. Without much exaggeration, I can say that before him India's economy was similar to that of Ethiopia, by the end of his term, it had become the fastest growing economy in the world.

P.S: I am not against Modi either, he has been a pretty good PM until now. But, I think he has not achieved as much as Narasimha has, at least not yet.",2015-04-05 00:55:56

490,"First of all, government doesn't print money, that is the first route in my example. It creates money supply through credit. What you are recommending, already happens through expansion of money supply through credit - **government bonds, infrastructure bonds**. Most successful example is Konkan Railway - **Rs.2,750 crore was raised in bonds**. 

Government should not expand money supply to an extent greater than the wealth creation, as it will only erode value of currency, that is, cause inflation. Private players in India cannot raise money because, creditors know that the infrastructure projects will not finish on time, will not be profitable etc. Government can keep increasing the money supply through bonds, to finance infrastructure projects, but ultimately, the projects will fail and only people who will suffer and citizen because the value of currency will erode. 

Using my analogy, box owners knows that apple-producers cannot produce 200 apples, so it would be stupid on his part to print Rs.100. This is exactly what Gov. Rajan is warning the Modi government- **[Push to finance infrastructure should not override financial stability: Rajan](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-cautions-banks-against-excessive-lending/article7061298.ece )** The better option is to improve ease of business, private player competition, FDI. **FDI is the single most important thing in the world for developing countries.** ",2015-04-05 01:44:37

Way to skip the point and totally derail the issue. Instead of trying to find fault, it'd have helped had you even tried to understand what I tried to say - that all of us Indians have a thing for memorials. It is unfair to lose sight of that while slamming just one entity, while someone else you support has been making a pitch for development and yet is going around inaugurating memorials.

&gt; Literally none of this, or your pathetic attempt at a subtle put down matters.

Of course, none of anything will matter to you.

What are you even trying to do here, man? The article clearly says the report was filed on the basis of mere suspicion. Do you know how much suspicion there is, about your favorite leader? Should we now start judging you by extorting answers from you on whether you support your leader for whatever he is merely suspected to have done?!

India suffers from an absence of understanding of what public duty means, especially among its babus and government servants.

In the case of an Army Chief, given the fact that the PMO controls what the Supreme Commander of the armed forces says at any given time, refusing to go see the PM would additionally be insubordination.

Yeah, this moron who is a justice of the SCI has the duty to set an example. You could not get away with shit like this in the US. If the POTUS invites you to a meeting, you go, unless you are dying, or one of your close relatives is.
