The fact that DoT decided to ban the whole website instead of the specific website shows how clueless they are about the purpose and the use of these services. On the same point it is strange that Twitter and Facebook have not been banned as they have the same (or more) propaganda.

6,"ok, I don't normally do this, but here's a slightly improved version of what you've written(in the original post):

I've not just edited it for the grammar, but also tweaked it slightly to my writing style. You need to build such a style for yourself.

&gt; Hello, /r/india. I am a passionate web dev, currently working on a social network for our college. 

&gt;My aim is not to re-invent Facebook again. Instead, I am including features which would be useful in a college environment, such as a notes-dump(where students can upload notes or question papers), a travel thread(where you can discuss places to visit in the city) and a tips section to guide juniors. 

&gt; I aim to include the teachers too, in a sensible system where campus issues can be discussed in a constructive manner. Namo has taken a really cool step of ""Digital India"", which set me thinking: What features could be part of such a custom tailored Indian social network?

And a version of your current comment:

&gt; I have edited my reddit post, is it ok now? Thanks for the info. It is a critical loss if one isn't taken seriously. I will try to improve my vocabulary too. Maybe the best way to do this is reading novels, right?

Yeah, reading is a very quick way to improve grammar. Pick some good books.

Also note that the letter I is always capitalized, if it is used to refer to oneself.

17,"Are loonies all around the spectrum though? Yes. Is this a binary issue? No. It's a matter of volume.

At this stage, I'll be blunt. This is the way it fundamentally is. It's my opinion that even proving or doing a stat analysis is pointless. You are missing the point anyway. People here are emotional, not logical. And us proving it or not only leads to ""explaining away"" the problem. Till someone else comes along and starts the same argument you are and again it results in nothing.

I've had 3 years at this, and it's pointless.

You can argue with me, assume I'm insane, clueless, incapable of math, biased, hate the right wing, whatever. I don't care. 

I do know that I've spent the better part of my time on this forum arguing as even handedly I can, and even if I wasn't a mod, I'd hold this view without a shadow of a doubt.

I have spent the time to understand the mechanisms, the type of posts, the flaws in arguments and it's straight up conspiracy and victim old land in the right side. And it's so deep that it's not even questionable by members of that spectrum. 

 I'm not angry or judgmental. You would feel bad, you are angry, when you love your country and your identity and then feel
abused by people you expect to trust. 

I'd be upset.

And I would post bluntly, in your face, with the ""bitter truth"", the brave uncensored, non politically correct harsh realities which the Lilly livered intellectuals can't dare countenance.

But is never condone violence. I'd be questioning my beliefs always.

And I've seen old chat logs, where people actively want to fuck ""liberals"", and the mods and the forums. I've seen the namo army chat lots, I've see. What makes up the rank and file and what the point really is about.


Angry people - They hate authority figures. Especially ones which consider their opinions bunk - because bigoted views are debunked by intellectuals and the congress, so anyone following that pattern must also be an intellectual or congress agent. 

For worse, the right has a massive anger issue and they are online. Maybe as other groups come online it will get EVEN worse, with some sort of forum apocalypse as every angry teenager and mental child comes up and flexes their e-peen. 

Right now, the right rules and is angry. And it's just getting worse. I suspect there is no room for compromise, and that the loonies in the spectrum will eventually utterly poison the discourse, drag the middle into the fray and finally the people who are still trying to be intelligent about their points will just have to adapt to the mess that was created.

In short damms, I'm telling you that I know you are sensitive to the plight of Brahmins, and how further you are sensitive to the right. And I'm telling you that most of the trolls do come from there. They depend on your defence to revitalize their sense of victimhood, and to establish their moral high ground. 

But most of them, are from the right. 

Whether you believe me or not is up to you. I'm giving you the best you are going to get from me.

I belong to the so called tribal area and studied till 6th grade in an RSS run school (so called Vidya Bharati). Do you know why I was moved from the school? Rampant child molestation that goes on there. The kind of people RSS recruits (manages to recruite as the pay is really low around 1200-1300 Rs. per month) to be the teachers of young/adolescent kids are actually sick. These teachers are the same volunteers who go to demolish building, burn property and sometimes kill people. So please I have seen enough of RSSs' ""We do good"" bullshit. They are playing a very dangerous game, and  unfortunately think they are doing a great service to the country and hinduism.

&gt; I hope you know the supreme court did not find Modi guilty in the 2002 riot case

Does it mean he as a chief minister was not accountable to the failure of his administration in the state while a planned mass genocide unfolded itself. and btw, he refuses to even apologies for things he dint do that time. 

Lets talk about kejriwal's plans and biography once you have done 0.1% of what he has done for the country.What you call leaving is actually called the evolution. He at least left selflessly (to contribute to the society) unlike others who leave because they are denied promotions. 
And now that we are on the topic of leaving, Can you explain to me how somebody can leave his wife just on her own ?

&gt; So the people who diligently paid their electricity bills were stupid?

You rant about me using caps or raising my voice but your baseless insinuations premised on nothing else but mere assumption like this one here or about the third party auditing do irritate me a little.

I did not answer your 90% reservation question because nobody with a bit of genuine interest in the issue eventually finds out the reality behind it and stops harping upon it. NOw let me tell you that though I am against the quantum of  reservation I support the reservation based on domicile system because state tax payers have paid the money for these colleges and hence they should have the first right to admissions. Now, A list of fun facts for you to consider
Fact - The AAP has proposed 90% reservation for Delhi students in colleges that are fully-funded and 50% reservation in colleges that are partially-funded by the Delhi Government
Fact - There are 12 fully-funded and 16 partially-funded colleges out of a total of 86 colleges in Delhi University.
Fact - A number of states have the domicile system in place for state-funded as well as private institutions at a figure ranging from 10 - 50%, with the average being close to 30%.(including maharashtra) This holds especially true for engineering and medical seats, which are arguably the most sought-after educational courses in India.
Conclusion - There will be 90% reservation for Delhi students in 13.95% of DU colleges and 50% reservation in 18.60% of DU colleges. Effectively, there will be a total of 21.85% reservation for Delhi students in Delhi University colleges, which is much lesser than the average domicile reservation in other states. (Unlike you I do not shift goal posts)

&gt; And don't compare this to Scandinavia, you're not the only guy in this conversation who has lived abroad


This is relevant and not a personal attack?

&gt; And would people have paid 40% tax to support such schemes then?

Who said about implementing all of their schemes, existing revenue rates are enough to sustain what is being promised. Do a bit research, they have already proposed how and whys of resources for all of their schemes.

&gt; What I dislike about AAP now is the so-called activism movement. You can sit on a dharna and solve all problems in the world seems to be the popular perception among AAPians.

Really? Mahatma Gandhi was an activist. JP got rid of emergency through his activism movement. And once again your asuumptions are wrong, right now AAP is the only party who have clear solutions for Delhi's problems. Recall that the solution for the corruption 'Jan Lokpal' was present already. they had to sit on dharna because govt refused to listen to their very justified demands. 


&gt; It is so easy to ask everyone else to change or to call others bad names, and yet so difficult to work hard and make changes within yourself that you ultimately want to see in the world.

This is what AAP's message to BJP is. To bring transparency and reduce corruption in the politics first the political parties has to come clean. They should show from where all of their funds come, who pays them 5000 Crs. and how are they utilized. AAP has already done it, and now India waits for BJP to practise what it preaches.

44,"&gt; Source for the 10% figure please, with definitions for what constitutes a member of the top leadership.

Why should I proved the figures? The BJP shills are the ones saying that most of them have left. When asked, they talk about Binny! That's the intellectual maturity I am having a discussion with.

&gt; I never claimed that 'most' of AAP's top leadership have left. That's a strawman you've introduced.

Straw man? Scroll up in the comments and check the number of times someone has said that or even on /r/India That was the context of the discussion. You jumped out like Captain America and said that I introduced a straw man. Do try using the ""context"" button on Reddit - it works.

&gt; If I see a number of AAP's 'faces' from the last election (May 2014) leave the party, I am completely within my rights to say its leadership is in disarray. I, however, haven't said that. Again, a strawman you've introduced.

So how does this work? Initially, call the induced ""faces"" as opportunists. When they leave, call the leadership in disarray. Like a Nashik dhol, which bangs from both sides - of course leaving brains aside.

&gt; Good, so you realise what's happening to you.

Your delusions of grandeur are not the truth. 

&gt;By this I assume you're hinting at BJP supporters. It's funny that you're calling them a brigade when there are no signs of brigading.

FYI, there's brigading which even the reddit admins (not mods) realize but the solution is not straightforward. Soon, things will come out but your jaundiced glasses wouldn't come out - I'm afraid.

You do realise that a number of us were rooting for AAP in the last Delhi assembly elections, right? 

These 'faces' (WTF is an induced face?) were campaigning and appearing on debates on TV on behalf of the AAP. If you're letting someone campaign for you and appear on many (if not most) TV debates on your party's behalf, they are leaders. Simple as that.

Every second day there is a thread on ""Why do educated people support that fount of communal poison the BJP"". Instead of all of us endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff, I wanted to take a slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from NDA I era and the UPA I &amp;amp; II regimes. I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs and I have no idea how to upload these onto Reddit otherwise, ideas welcome. Also how does one make tables on Reddit? Copy pasting from excel again does not work.

**The Data** -

Indicator             | NDA          | UPA I          | UPA II
----------------------|--------------|----------------|-------
Agriculture           | 2.78%        | 3.07%          | 4.10%
Industry              | 5.80%        | 9.10%          | 5.10%
Services              | 7.60%        | 9.90%          | 8.09%

On GDP growth rates, nothing much to choose from though the UPA seems to have done well across all sectors, as to how this wa achieved, I will cover it a little later.

Indicator   | NDA     | UPA I     | UPA II
------------|---------|-----------|-------
CAD         | 3.40%   | -13.12%   | -56.58%

On CAD, the UPA performance looks horrible, one could attribute increasing oil prices (it touched a peak of $ 100 a barrel) to a certain extent, but it is only a portion of why the CAD went down so horribly.

Indicator              | NDA     | UPA I          | UPA II
-----------------------|---------|----------------|-------
Inflation WPI          | 4.58    | 5.9            | 7.08
Inflation CPI          | 3.86    | 6.04           | 10.18

Inflation seems to have been horribly mismanaged by the UPA, and this is largely due to deficit financing and pumping in huge funds into the rural sector in the form of MNREGA. The MNREGA was in the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients as it drove up prices over and hurt the economy as a whole.

Indicator               | NDA  | UPA I   | UPA II
------------------------|------|---------|-------
Fiscal Deficit          | 3.8  | 30.86   | 76

Again, how did the UPA achieve the funding of such profligate schemes such as MNREGA or the Food Safety Act or the loan waiver? By deficit financing. It essentially spent more (which govts usually do) more than what it earned. This also has the side effect of fueling inflation.

And now we come to why I believe even these numbers are illusionary,

Agriculture                         | 21.25      | -15.71
Manufacturing                       | 11.72      | -7.23
Non Manufacturing                   | 9.11       | 26.14
Services                            | 18.77      | -0.48
Total                               | 60.85      | 2.72

The net jobs added by the NDA in 10 years as compared to the UPA in 12 (data for 2013 on was not available)  is not even comparable and this is why I believe the UPA growth was an illusory / jobless growth.

Factor in the 10 million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and it is imperative that as a nation we find jobs for all of them.

Another factor I would have liked to compare but as data is not available prior to 2008 I will leave it out of scope but just mention it. This is the indicator of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in infrastructure. The NDA as well know focussed a lot on infrastructure, roads and the highway network being chief amongst these. The NDA added more roads in 5 years than 30 years of other governments combined. Without the govt massively investing in actual infrastructure, job creation and economic growth is going to be difficult to manage.

This is not new either (the UPA mismanagement), Indira Gandhi did pretty much the same thing. She created an import fueled bubble of illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation. *Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser by Krishnaswamy* goes into detail into how Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring to 75% in the late 60's. Indira also established the trend of a socialistic economy (not her father, who piloted a Mixed economy) by ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal to banking to wheat and imposing draconian restrictions on the private sector. Indira ALSO failed to focus on infrastructure, and during her first regime, cut down on investment in infrastructure.

After Nehru who did very well to guide the Indian economy given his set of challenges, every succeeding Gandhi dynast has been an absolute disaster for the national economy. 

The problem is, the Gandhi / Congress way has now caught on and almost every major party follows the same dead approach of populsim, throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics.

**Subjective opinion**- In BJP I see a party that is serious about building up infrastructure, that is serious about creating jobs, that while populist, marries this populism with a sense of pragmatism. It is arguably the only party right now that sees merit in manufacturing as being the workhorse of the Indian economy. I see how the BJP method has worked (relative to India of course) in places like Chatisgarh, MP, Gujarat, Goa. Yes, it has failed in Karnataka, yet it has the resilience to learn and apply lessons and not just throw up some dynast scion to continue the same tired old politics.

Sloganeering, empty tokenism and sops all won't work without some hard reforms, and this is something the BJP has an established track record in and this is why I support the BJP.

Edit - I seriously (cross my heart and hope to die, pinky swear level) don't care about points, and a self post doesn't even give me any points, but 30 seconds after I posted this, I was at -1. I wonder if I am being brigaded by the NaMo Army.

Edit 1 - Somebody please tell me how to draw tables or upload graphs here. The post looks messy without tables.

49,"&gt;Ok, so anything which happens this year is Manmohan's?


Of course yes. Any growth that happened in 2014 and maybe till mid 2015 will be attibuted to MMS. Only an imbecile will assume that structural reforms take effect in a day and lose effect the moment someother party takes over.

ABVP was able to achieve what he achieved because of PVN, MMS had a good run in the beginning because of ABVP. NaMO now has a shitty time because of MMS and Sonia Madameji.",2015-01-23 17:31:28

53,"Its not cherry picking....NaMo is the PM of our country and AajTak praising him (mostly comparing him with international leaders) is to my mind obligatory. Its like the NYtimes saying Obama is great compared to Modi.

On the other hand, praising AAP and saying they trust only AAP or praising Kejri and comparing him to Anil Kapoor all of it before or during elections is definitely a case of yellow journalism.",2015-01-25 05:51:27

55,"Young person, the world is your oyster.  I commend you on having both a personal and a societal goal for yourself while so young. You can serve your nation either directly or indirectly. Directly--using your own hands , so to speak. Indirectly--through your wealth, power, influence. The former can be personally very satisfying, and you ought to do keep doing some of that, but the latter will have the greatest impact. So be the best you can be in any field of endeavour, gain power, influence or wealth, and use your good offices to influence over individuals and organisations to make India better. This is what NaMo and Obama appear to have done, whether or not you agree with their plans. You can do the same. ",2015-01-26 13:58:31
