1,"Seriously...People here are anti Hindu, anti rss and anti bjp?  Wouldn't that explain why NaMo posts flood the front page every day and long posts are written to defend the BJP?",2014-10-30 16:48:30
2,"Assuming that dividing the country implies the start of a separatist or an extremist movement and a violent counter-reaction to that, Mr Modi is factually wrong. Sikh Militancy and the Khalistan movement were a reality much before 1984. Countless Sikhs and Hindus had already suffered from the hands of Khalistanis in late 70s and early 80s. In-fact, Bhindranwale's was at his peak in 1984. 

Loss of every innocent life is condemn-able in strongest terms, and what happened in '84 Delhi was nothing less than a genocide. But here, the attempt by NaMo is not to reach out to the people affected by those horrendous events. Instead it is to deflect attention from a  significant historical movement forever etched in BJP's (and Sangh's) legacy, i.e Babri Masjid demolition and the ensuing communal disturbances. The events in '92 divided country country like no other event before. One can read ""Dongri To Dubai"" (or watch 'Black Friday', ~~another movie harassed by the censor board~~) to know how the events in Ayodha finally culminated in the Mumbai bomb blasts. 

Whenever the state becomes complicit in the murder of innocents, it triggers a chain of event which results in deranged individuals taking vengeance by attacking the innocent civilians.

3,"If you haven't realized, BJP has already descended into sycophancy of colossal levels. There is only one chant that all minsters and BJP members make and that is of NaMo. 

Ofcourse Modi and Amit Shah should be criticized. My point was that if you're looking for party with internal democracy and openess then a Modi led BJP is not your choice. This is how he ruled in Gujarat. All dissenters including RSS men were swatted/bumped off. 

Some people I know don't mind this and hence still support BJP. I was suggesting that you'll have to learn to live with this if Modi led BJP is the party you prefer. ",2014-10-31 22:42:17

9,"It is true !

Despite repeated attempts by Advani to claim the PM candidature from BJP for 2014 elections, it was the overwhelming pressure by the grass root workers that caused the BJP to name NaMo as the PM candidate. If that isnt Internal Democracy, I dont know what is.

10,"I dont understand how Haren Pandya is related to internal democracy in the BJP. Almost all sources claim he was probably killed in retaliation of 2002 riots.

11,"Mate, the image for which Namo is still popular in that incident is the speed with which he went for Tata after Mamata gave up due to the mess with Singur.

Among people who love to discuss the fate of the nation, NaMo's strongest impression is this. They don't care whether Nano itself failed as it was being touted as a possible game changer in that market by almost everyone.

That was not PR. And you cannot doubt sincerity. You are talking about speeches as if it's some special trick to cheat people. 

People got his pure intentions. They didn't care if Nano failed. They didn't doubt his commitment. ",2014-11-05 01:27:02

27,"Question for European randians... How when do schools in Europe teach students classical languages like Greek or Latin? Is it a part of the high school curriculum or do they have courses at undergraduate level in the university?

Even though I regret the fact that I did not take Sanskrit classes in school seriously and hence now have to rely on English translations of old Indian scriptures instead of reading from the source text itself, I believe it makes more sense to teach German, Chinese French, Spanish and Russian in schools. Sanskrit ought to be taught at undergrad level where one can read the original literature. Tue Sanskrit taught in schools is not adequate imho.

Imagine it we can train 10000s of guys and girls in Japanese who can then immigrate and take up all sorts of jobs there and not only be limited to highly skilled professionals. 

Btw, NaMo speaks of this all the time when he says he wants to export teachers and nurses and how our demographic advantage will allow us to fill up the global demand of skilled labour.

All in all, bad move by MHRD. Congis and AAPis - please fuck with Tulsi and take govt to task on this one.",2014-11-14 14:05:43

45,"&gt; But did Modiji want her shooting in the Gym with him?

Irrelevant. What's relevant is she has 0 contribution to his success. 

&gt; Why? He dumped her, she has the right to say whatever she wants.

Constitutionally she does but she's not stupid: she knows damn well how this will be played out: Modi-ji ki biwi ne kaha woh 7RCR mein jaane taiyyar hain etc. Why even play that angle when she's not been in touch with the man for 40 years? 

Again, this is my 2 cents but if a woman hasn't been with a man while on his way to the top she has 0 right over whatever success he achieves 

Regardless of who dumped who. 

This goes both ways: If in a parallel universe, Mrs. Modi left NaMo and became PM and NaMo was a school teacher / house husband type I'd expect him to say no comment and get on with it.

There are certain things Indians regard as holy cows and just *cannot* be criticized. For example:

Let's be honest apart from the USA which loves to give away weapons for free to Pakistan in lieu of using them as its bitch; no other country not even China gives anything for free. Especially Putin who is facing a cash crunch. And Pakis have no money. They are balancing their budget by taking IMF loans and repaying old EMIs by taking new loans. So nothing big gonna happen there.

Coming to strategic realignment. I feel this was Putin's way of putting some pressure on NaMo before his visit next month ""See, we may align with Pakistan if you don't do as I say.""
