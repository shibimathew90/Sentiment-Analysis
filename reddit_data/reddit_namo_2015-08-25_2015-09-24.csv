This. 

As a Bihari and as someone who passionately hates both Modi and BJP, this is the only reason why, if ever i want BJP to win. For the last 20 years or so Bihar had an unfortunate experience of having governments that are different from government that is running the center. Ideally it shouldn't have mattered but it did.

I am a big fan of Nitish Kumar. The way he is being hounded by BJP supporters in general and Namo-army in particular has made me all the more sympathetic towards him. But in a very narrow sense he has outlived his utility. I hate myself for saying this but there is no other way to put it. Make no mistake even in the current political scenario i think there is no Bihari leader more well meaning, more moderate, more capable than him. But as i have said it earlier the prospect of having the same government at both center and state is too good to miss out and it's worth a try especially since Bihar didn't have this experience in years.

I dont think the circlejerk of the BJP haters on this forum who are hypocrites of the highest order understand what a quotation mark is. Conveniently omitting the most relevant part of the sentence and making it sound offensive does not make it a quote. It is a misleading agenda driven drivel.

How are you so sure it's not just regular people downvoting as opposed to ""brigading""? And please do not remind us with how much years of experience you have with moderation, as that is not a valid answer to this question. 

1) Have you tried reporting that thread to admins and get their opinion on whether or not there has been any brigading on that thread?

2) Do you have any proof that the so called ""namo brigade"" is **still** an active brigade? Why should I trust your word that there has been any brigade on that thread and what you are saying here is not FUD tactics?

Either you have proof of it or you're full of shit and making it up for FUD. If you do, why don't you take it up with admins? I don't understand the point of it if you have proof of any active brigading, you're sitting on it, and then ranting here about it. It doesn't make sense.

47,"&gt; Under Golwalkar RSS completely abstained from the Quit India Movement. 

&gt; The British Government stated that the RSS was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them, and as such their other political activities(even if objectionable) can be overlooked.Post the Quit India movement, Golwalkar did not want to give the British any excuse to ban the RSS, and he was willing to follow any British order to that end.

They were ready to bend over backwards to the Britishers, so that they are not banned. Now they make hue and cry about how British Rule / Congress rule ruined India, and how western influence is bad. Fucking disgraceful. 

The more I read about them, the more I lose respect. Also, Just found out:

&gt; Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has written a biographical profile of Golwalkar in his book ""Jyotipunj""; Modi considers Golwalkar to be one of his inspirations.

Namo is sanghi to the core. Let there be no mistake about this. All that PR that says otherwise, is bullshit. No one in their right mind, would consider Golwalkar to be their ""inspiration"" otherwise.

&gt; In his book A Life of Our Times, Rajeshwar Dayal, who was the Chief Secretary to the United Provinces Government in 1947-1948, comments on the official discovery of Golwalkar's plan to carry out a pogrom(massacare) of Muslims.

&gt; Timely raids conducted on the premises of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh) had brought the massive conspiracy to light. The whole plot had been concerted under the direction and supervision of the Supremo of the organization[Golwalkar] himself. Both Jaitley and I pressed for the immediate arrest of the prime accused, Shri Golwalkar, who was still in the area.

Fucking madarchods. Each 1 of them. Fuck them. No wonder congress got to rule India for 60 years. Because India is not chutiya enough to give RSS too much power. I have no sympathy left for Modi / Modi supporters after reading this. Will continue to support any good thing that government does. But fuck them, in general.
