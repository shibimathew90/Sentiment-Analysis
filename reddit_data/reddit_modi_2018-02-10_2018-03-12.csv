**India Can Play Key Role In Middle East Peace Process: Palestine President Abbas** 

 ______ 
**Ramallah: **

Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic Palestine visit, President
Mahmoud Abbas said he will discuss with him India's role in the Middle East
peace process and the creation of a multilateral forum of negotiations to
strike a final deal with Israel.

PM Modi, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Palestine, is reaching
Ramallah tomorrow amid heightened tensions in the region after US President
Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

The unilateral US decision to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was
challenged at the UN General Assembly where 128 nations, including India,
voted to turn down the move as ""null and void"".

""We are receiving Prime Minister Modi in a historic visit that will
demonstrate the strong ties and relations between the Palestinian people and
the brotherly Indian people,"" President Abbas told PTI in an e-mail interview.

Though India has shied away from becoming a party in the Israel-Palestinian
conflict, the Palestinian leader on several occasions has stressed on a
possible role for New Delhi in the Middle East peace process.

""We will discuss the recent updates with Prime Minister Modi, and the recent
developments in the peace process, the bilateral relations, and the regional
situations. And the possible role India can play in enhancing peace in the
region, as well as discussing different economical aspects beyond the existing
ties we already possess,"" President Abbas said.

Describing India as a ""very respected country in the international arena"", the
82-year-old Palestinian President said that India can have a possible role in
creating a multilateral forum of negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israelis to reach a final agreement.

He said PM Modi's visit to the region reflects India's long-held position of
supporting peace and stability in the region.

""We believe in the importance of a possible Indian role... to reach a final
agreement based on international consensus and resolutions, in which India and
other countries can be part of,"" President Abbas said.

""The long Indian position of supporting the two-state solution is well known.
India has supported the Palestinian cause throughout the years of conflict,
and we rely on the Indian support in order to reach the independence of the
Palestinian State,"" he added.

As Palestine works to establish an international multilateral mechanism of
negotiations, the Palestinian leader stated that ""India can play a role in
this"".

""The relations between India and Palestine are historical...This visit will
culminate the historic ties between the two brotherly people, and will help in
increasing and strengthening these ties that we possess,"" he said.

PM Modi would be skipping Israel during his forthcoming tour of Middle East in
a clear message that New Delhi is de-hyphenating its ties with the Jewish
state and Palestine. PM Modi had visited Israel last year in July in a
standalone visit that had led to many analysts questioning the future of the
Indo-Palestine ties.

When asked about India's growing engagement with Israel, an unperturbed Abbas
said that ""any state has the right to establish relations with other
countries"".

""We believe in the importance of our relationship with the brotherly Indian
State, the support of India to the Palestinian people, and the relationship we
possess with the Indian people, will not be effected by India s relations with
any other State,"" he emphasised.

""India has recognised the State of Palestine in 1988, and we cannot forget the
last Indian vote in favour of Palestine's rights in Jerusalem in the United
Nations General Assembly, and all the political stands that India has taken to
support the Palestinian rights in the international arena,"" President Abbas
said referring to India's vote at the UN.

India has consistently voted in favour of resolutions supporting the
Palestinian cause at international forums, an issue that has bothered
strategic partner Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently said that he was
""disappointed"" at the Indian vote at the UN but also expressed hope that there
will be a possible change of heart over a period of time.

Appreciating India's assistance in strengthening Palestinian economy through
executing several projects in the Palestinian areas, President Abbas said that
""he cannot forget"" New Delhi's support and wishes to further discuss with PM
Modi areas of cooperation in the economic sphere.

A number of MoUs are likely to be signed between the two sides during PM
Modi's three-hour visit to Palestine under which India will provide funding
for a number of projects in the fields of health, education, culture and
women's empowerment.

""The Indian Government and its people have provided significant assistance and
aid to the Palestinian people by establishing training centres, schools, and
the necessary humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people under occupation in
the West Bank and Gaza,"" President Abbas noted.

""And in 2016 we laid the foundation stone to establish the Palestine India
Techno Park project in Ramallah, and we are also looking forward the
establishment of the Institute of Diplomacy that is kindly funded by the
Indian Government"", he noted.

__ Comments

A lot of Palestinian diplomats have received training in India and hundreds of
Palestinians have availed scholarships to study at Indian institutions as part
of New Delhi's effort towards capacity building in Palestine.

""We are working on promoting the economical relations through introducing
businessmen and investors from both sides on the available opportunities in
the sectors of tourism, technological exchange in many areas, including
industrial, agricultural, and information systems, and on the other hand,
signing government agreements to support businessmen and protect their
investments,"" he said.

**New tax score: Modi government bags Rs 26,500 crore from those who didn't file returns** 

 ______ 
Modi government's high-voltage drive to go after the big evaders has improved
its

tax

kitty this year, forcing the filing of at least 1.7 crore in extra returns
that took its mop-up close to Rs 26,500 crore till December.

Finance minister

Arun Jaitley

in a reply to Parliament said that the tax department had been identifying
non-filers by tracking in-house information and tallying it with data on high-
value transactions received from external agencies along with

TDS

and tax collected at source (

TCS

).

""The mechanism for collection and verification of financial information has
been broadened to include data in respect of various types of high-value
transactions from banks and financial institutions and high-value expenditure
from commercial establishments in the form of Statement of Financial
Transaction (SFT),"" the FM said, adding that the scope of TDS and TCS was also
expanded.

He said quoting Permanent Account Number (PAN) was now mandatory for
transactions of over Rs 2 lakh, including on property, shares, bonds,
insurance and foreign travel. This was yielding enormous data, which was being
mined by the tax department.

As a result, last year, as many as 35 lakh non-filers were identified, who the
tax department believe had a tax liability. Although the number is down from
67 lakh a year ago, many who had large cash deposits may have filed returns.

The move is part of an exercise aimed at deepening the

income tax

system with the FM saying this year, the target was to get 1.25 crore new
return filers.

He said that after identifying the non-filers, the government was using rule-
based algorithms to classify cases into various categories and monitoring
them. Text messages and emails were also sent to the targeted groups to file
returns and a compliance management cell had been set up to track responses.
This was followed by notices.

The system is now proposed to be made more stringent through a new mechanism,
called Project Insight, to target individuals and seek voluntary compliance.

**India pushes for UN mission to visit Maldives** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India is working with its international partners to ask

United Nations

to send a fact-finding mission to Maldives so that impartial observers can
assess the situation on the ground and nudge the

Abdulla Yameen

government into restoring democracy.

The move is part of hectic back-channel maneuvers New Delhi is currently
engaged in to exercise diplomatic options to deal with the crisis in the
island nation following President Yameen's decision to impose an emergency and
place the supreme court chief justice under arrest.

The situation in Maldives came up for discussion between Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

and US President Donald Trump early this morning. Sources on condition of
anonymity said most countries are looking to India to take a lead in dealing
with the problems in Maldives given its proximity and ability to influence
events in the archipelago.

""Both leaders expressed concern about the political crisis in Maldives and the
importance of respect for democratic institutions and rule of law,"" the White
House said in a readout of the phone call between Trump and Modi, the first
this year. Given Yameen's proximity to China which has invested heavily in his
regime, the India-US convergence is significant.

At the moment, India is exploring ""diplomatic options"" to get Yameen to see
sense. However, high-level sources said all options remain on the table if
normalcy was not restored in keeping with international opinion.

India earlier refused a request from Maldives to send a special envoy, foreign
minister Mohammed Asim who had travelled to Abu Dhabi expecting to board a
plane for New Delhi. After India's snub, Asim went on to Islamabad. There is
almost no likelihood that India will recieve any special envoy from the Yameen
government in the near future.

On Friday, Maldives asked China to provide ""security"" for its investment in
Maldives, a thinly veiled request for troops. China refused. In a statement,
India said ""We note that China has said that Maldives government has the
ability to protect the security of Chinese personnel and institutions in
Maldives. We hope that all countries can play a constructive role in Maldives,
instead of doing the opposite"".

Over the past few days, international voices calling for Yameen to return to
some sort of democratic rule are increasing despite China, Yameen's primary
backer, calling for dialogue between political parties in Maldives.

On Thursday, Yameen refused to meet senior European diplomats who were the
first foreign dignitaries to visit the troubled nation since his crackdown.
Envoys from the European Union, Germany and Britain arrived in Male. German
Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Jorn Rohde, said the trio requested meetings to
discuss Yameen's crackdown. ""Sadly the Maldivian government refuses dialogue
today with my UK/EU colleagues... Our requests were unfortunately refused,""
Rohde said on Twitter. ""That is surely not the way forward"".

32,"&gt; Do you think inherently there is a ""pro-BJP"" mindset in our nation, given how powerful BJP is at the moment, holding the power in many states? 

Yes. And I think this is one of Nehru's biggest failures. As someone's flair says, Nehru is responsible for Modi. Literally. His intention was right - he wanted to inculcate scientific temper, but his approach of top down trickle down science, by starting IITs and AIIMS doesn't seem to have helped reduce ignorance of the masses. Couple ignorance with joblessness, and what you get is the most fertile grounds for sanghi bigots to gain power. 

Which brings me to - the lackadaisical job growth might be just incompetence on the emperor's part, but it feeds directly into his vote bank. So even if he's not doing it deliberately, his incompetance is actually helping him.

&gt;I mean, there is the unproven EVM-hacking theory, but I can't decide if it's true or not.

While EVM-hacking is certainly possible - no system is ""foolproof"" contrary to UIDAI claims, especially in India when you can buy access for a few hundred rupees, I don't think we need to go that far to explain 2014. Tatas and Ambanis who were buying ministerial berths in UPA (remember Raadia tapes) said Modi was the best thing to happen to India before 2014 elections. Corporates disproportionately invested in the sangh for that election. American consultants and countrywide holographic ad campaigns ain't cheap. You think Tatas and Ambanis didn't expect better bang for their bucks?

No I don't - I'm holding him to the standards he claims to adhere to himself. If he admits he's not a superhuman, doesn't work 36 hrs a day without pooping, and didn't leave his mommy ""for the nation"", I won't expect superhuman things from him.",2018-02-10 14:43:21

NEW DELHI:

Congress

president

Rahul Gandhi

on Saturday accused Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

of 'driving' the country with his gaze fixed firmly on the rear-view mirror.

""PM Modi drives while looking in the rear-view mirror. That's why he drives
the car into potholes. To lead India, he will have to look forward, not back,""
Rahul said at a rally in Karnataka's Hospete.

""PM Modi's backward-looking thought caused demonetisation and 'Gabbar Singh
Tax',"" he jibed.

Referring to the Narendra Modi's 90-minute speech in Lok Sabha, Rahul said, in
Parliament the PM is obligated to answer questions asked by the nation.
Criticism of another party should be reserved for a public rally.

Rahul also appreciated Karnataka chief minister

Siddaramaiah

for ""doing his job,"" but mocked Modi, asking him ""when he will do his work.""

The previous

BJP

state government, led by former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa, ""broke the
world record in corruption,"" the Congress chief charged.

Urging the state's people to not trust those who make ""false promises,"" he
claimed ""Modi's words are hollow.""

Striking an emotional note, Rahul recalled how Ballari ""stood with Sonia
Gandhi and chose her when she needed you.""

""I share a special connection with Ballari. You stood with Sonia Gandhi and
chose her when she needed you. I will never forget this in my life,"" he said.

BJP under Modi has been attempting to undo in 3 years all of the institutional improvements that took place in the last 25 years - and somehow you think that is justified?

but in parliament, he needs to answer questions put to him. ""Here, you have to
answer to the country. You are not to make accusations here...,"" he said,
adding that PM Modi's continued silence on the deal to buy Rafale fighter jets
confirmed their suspicions that there was something wrong.

The Congress president kept the attacks coming on Twitter too, accusing PM
Modi of misleading the country, trying to cover up his failures and skipping
issues that concern the public. ""When will the PM break his silence, and speak
on the Rafale deal,"" he said after PM Modi's stinging takedown of Congress
leaders in parliament.

""Not a single day has passed when the country has not suffered due to the
poison sowed by you,"" PM Modi had told the Lok Sabha earlier in the day. Had
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel been the first Prime Minister, a part of Kashmir
would not have been under control of Pakistan, he said.

The attacks from the Congress had come soon after.

""That is his history... he has a perverted history,"" former law minister M
Veerappa Moily said, advising PM Modi to brush up on his history.

__ Comments

""The right thing is to read Discovery of India of (Jawaharlal) Nehru, Glimpses
of (World) History and also, My Experiments of Truth. We prescribe those books
to PM Modi,"" Mr Moily said.

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said Prime Minister Modi might be a terrific
orator ""but this speech is a farrago of misrepresentations and half-truth"".

HE WOWED THE ELITE IN HINDI! SO PROD!"" - that's it, sort of a circlejerk.

**10 Lakh Students Skip Board Exams, Yogi Adityanath Seeks Simple Tests** 

 ______ 
Yogi Adityanath says strict monitoring has stopped mass cheating in UP board
exams (File)

**New Delhi: **

After 10 lakh students did not appear in the Uttar Pradesh board exams in the
last four days, Chief Minister Yogi made a case for making tests simpler so
that they do not scare away students. The drastic fall in the number of
students who were supposed to write the exams is also a result of strict
monitoring to end cheating in the tests, the chief minister said.

""When we said let's conduct a cheating-free exam, 10 lakhs students dropped
out. This is the figure until now. I don't know what will happen in future,""
Mr Adityanath said.

The 45-year-old saffron-robed chief minister was launching the Hindi edition
of Exam Warriors, a self-help interactive book by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
that seeks to serve as a handy guide for students.

""A fear of exams is being created among students,"" Mr Adityanath said, adding
the book by PM Modi will help students set a confident frame of mind for
taking exams. ""It is necessary to think on how exams could be further
simplified,"" said Mr Adityanath, who was made chief minister in March last
year after the BJP won the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections with a massive
mandate.

The chief minister, who is also the head priest of the Gorakhnath temple in
Uttar Pradesh, went on to cite an example of how the annual pilgrimage

_Kanwar yatra_

is organised smoothly because it does not involve instructions that could
impede the event or inconvenience people.

""When I took stock of the situation, I was told that several instructions had
been given to avoid any untoward incident. The officials said we have stopped
the use of mikes, conches and bells,"" he said of the

_Kanwar yatra_

on the Ghaziabad-Haridwar route where, according to Mr Adityanath, four crore
people walked last year.

Mr Adityanath said the officials told him that the route passed through some
sensitive areas and it was difficult to keep an eye on them. ""I said permit
people to use mike, conches and bells as per the Supreme Court guidelines.
Inspire people so that they themselves welcome the yatra and be part of it,""
Mr Adityanath said, adding there were indeed no disturbances during the

_yatra_

.

The conclusion, the chief minister said, was that had the government put in
barriers, then it would not have been easy to organise the annual pilgrimage.

""So, parents and teachers should not impose any kind of barriers on students
and provide them with a good climate to cope with exams,"" he said.

__ Comments

The chief minister said that of six lakh youth who had enrolled in a skill
development programme in Uttar Pradesh in the last 10 months, 2.5 lakh cleared
the tests and 1.4 lakh were placed in jobs that paid between Rs 15,000 and Rs
40,000.

**‘Rearview driving’ by PM Modi causing accidents like demonetisation, says Rahul Gandhi**

Congress chief said the key problems facing the country are lack of jobs and
problems faced by farmers, tribals, scheduled castes and the urban poor.

By constantly blaming the Congress for problems in the country Prime Minister
Narendra Modi is steering the nation with his eyes on the rearview mirror and
is not looking at the future, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said in
Karnataka’s Bellary district on Saturday. The Congress president launched the
party’s campaign for the upcoming Karnataka Assembly polls from the Hyderabad-
Karnataka region, where his party is considered to be on a strong footing,
with a three-day tour, including public meetings and visits to religious
centres.

Rahul told a gathering at Hospet, in Bellary, that “rearview driving” by PM
has led to accidents such as demonetisation and poor implementation of GST.
“Narendra Modi never spoke of the future when he spoke for an hour in
Parliament recently. He never spoke of giving jobs to the youth, but spoke of
what Congress did wrong in the past,” he said. “The country does not want to
hear history. It wants to know what lies ahead.”

In comparison, Rahul said, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is steering
the state while looking ahead. “You can steer the nation forward only by
looking ahead,” he emphasised. The Congress is being cited as the excuse for
all the shortcomings of the present government at the Centre, he maintained.
Rahul said the key problems facing the country are lack of jobs and problems
faced by farmers, tribals, scheduled castes and the urban poor. “You have to
trust people who tell the truth and must not believe those who speak lies,”
Rahul said, referring to a special status given to the Hyderabad-Karnataka
region during the UPA regime.

“BJP leader Advani said (at the time) it could not be done. But we promised to
do it — and where the region used to receive Rs 350 crore, it now receives Rs
4,000 crore,” Rahul said. Criticising Modi on the Rafale deal, Rahul said that
the Prime Minister must provide answers on the purchase of the Rafale aircraft
from a French company.  
“We had given the contract to HAL, a public sector company making aircraft for
70 years. If Bangalore is standing on its own legs today, then it is HAL that
has contributed to the city’s development. Modi snatched the contract from
Karnataka and gave it to his rich friend,” Rahul claimed.

“Why did you snatch the contract and give it to your friend? Why did you kill
the future of the youth of Bangalore,” he asked. The BJP government must
clarify whether the defence minister and the cabinet committee on security
cleared the Rafale deal, he said. More than 70,000 people from the Bellary,
Raichur and Chitradurga region attended the Hospet rally. Former BJP leaders
from Bellary, Anand Singh and B Nagendra, who are now with Congress, were
among the leaders who mobilised crowds.

Singh and Nagendra, who are being tried in several cases of illegal mining in
Bellary for alleged acts during the BJP’s rule in the state between 2008-13
shared the stage with Congress leaders on Saturday, even as Siddaramaiah and
Rahul accused the BJP government of 2008-13 of being the most corrupt.

86,"&gt;For the last three years, the former investigating officer (IO) of the Sohrabuddin-Kauser Bi, Tulsiram Prajapati killing cases, is facing multiple criminal investigations at the hands of his own agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Evidence has emerged suggesting that the CBI is possibly trying to frame its former IO by manufacturing false evidence against him.  The officer in question is Sandeep Tamgadge, a 2001 batch IPS officer belonging to the Nagaland cadre. Tamgadge belongs to Scheduled caste and originally belongs to Nagpur in Maharashtra.  He was on deputation to CBI fromOctober 2011 till October 2015. Two independent witnesses have given statements before a Nagpur court and the Maharashtra police that the CBI was forcing them to give false statements to implicate Tamgadge in a corruption-related case.”

&gt;“Tamgadge had twice interrogated Shah in connection with his alleged role in these multiple killings—once in January 2012 in connection with the  Prajapati murder case and again in October 2013 to probe Shah’s alleged role in the Ishrat Jahan killing. Again, it was Tamgadge who had filed the chargesheet in the Prajapati case, naming Shah as the prime accused,” the report adds.

Meanwhile, all of Modi's pets are being rewarded. Achal Jyoti was the CS of Gujarat before he was made the CEC. He was the one who recommended the disqualification of 20 AAP MLA's. 

Then there is the controversial appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the CBI Special Director.

&gt;The person concerned is Rakesh Asthana, officer of the 1984 batch of the Indian Police Service (IPS) belonging to the Gujarat cadre. He was appointed as special director of the Central Bureau of Investigation on October 22 by an order issued by the appointments committee of the cabinet comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Rajnath Singh.

&gt;This appointment is being challenged through a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by the non-government organisation Common Cause on the ground that Asthana is not a person of “impeccable integrity.” A disclaimer is in order: this writer is a member of the governing council of this organisation.

&gt;Asthana has held a number of important positions in his career, including those of inspector general of police, Vadodara, joint commissioner of police, Ahmedabad city and commissioner of police in Surat and Vadodara. **He was part of the special investigation team (SIT) appointed by the Gujarat government to inquire into the infamous Godhra train burning episode in 2002. Asthana is understood to be close to the prime minister as well as the BJP president Amit Shah.**",2018-02-11 11:58:34

**Congress poster on Facebook shows Rahul ‘protecting’ Renuka - Times of India** 

 ______ 
ALLAHABAD: A local

Youth Congress

leader on Friday uploaded a poster on Facebook and WhatsApp targeting PM

Narendra Modi

, BJP president Amit Shah and Union minister

Kiren Rijiju

allegedly for disrespecting Congress MP

Renuka Chaudhary

during a recent debate in Rajya Sabha.

The poster, uploaded by city

Congress leader Haseeb

Ahmad, has gone viral. It reads: ""Rakshamam... Rahul Gandhi. Ek stri ki hansi
Duryodhan ko khal gayee thi — yaad karo, 100 Kauravon ki chita jal gayi thi
(Protect us Rahul Gandhi... the laughter of a woman had once offended
Duryodhan and remember, hundreds of Kauravas had to lose their lives)."" In the
poster, Rahul is shown as Lord Krishna protecting Renuka Chaudhary.

_ Youth Congress leader Haseeb Ahmad uploaded this controversial poster on his
Facebook account  
_

The poster depicted the PM, Shah and Jaitley as Kauravas. It also carried
photographs of UPA chairperson

Sonia Gandhi

and Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pramod Tiwari, among others. Senior leaders of
city and district Congress committees feigned ignorance about the poster,
while the BJP leaders termed it as an attempt to seek publicity. Referring to
the Renuka episode, Haseeb said: ""It's sad that the PM has shown disrespect to
a woman MP in Rajya Sabha. Modi described the laughter of the woman MP in the
context of the Ramayana and we have launched a Mahabharat against him and his
team.""

He also demanded Modi to ""apologise to crores of Indian women."" Modi, during a
debate in Rajya Sabha, had reportedly said that Chowdhury's laughter reminded
him of the 1980s' TV serial 'Ramayana'. Hours later, Rijiju too shared a video

He is no man to be feeling inferior about.

That the chitter-chatter does not necessarily follow rational analysis of policies, results and hope.

Indians have a cultural predilection for heroes or villains, who can save/destroy all with a single might blow. Modi was hailed as an all conquering superhero and now is probably lower in the hype cycle.

Also stats capture the formal sector better, and the informal sector is the one beaten by demonetization. It's a little early to say if  the small scale tertiary suppliers on the verge of the informal sector may be getting caught in GST, or if this is good or bad..


Nevertheless, the cartoon point is valid - that Modi as PM (administrator, policy director and sometime reformer) can be overwhelmed by Modi the politician (blaming others and showing himself in the best light). 

The 2nd is that economic growth of India shouldn't really be evaluated according to external/western standards (for purpose of satisfaction). With a huge demographical influx of youngsters, the demands on job creation just to keep up with hopes and poverty prevention is insane.

The jobs creation engines of the past decade or two (the IT/BPO boom, minor liberalization) is sputtering. Leading to increased uncertainty about the future.

Of Modi's signature initiatives, one (land acquisition) was stillborn, one (demonetization) was a IMHO political ploy that actually took away from the overall economy, one (GST) may take some time to work itself out, and suffers from implementation issues and possibly gaps  in details (eg lack of simplification, churn/wrong rate settings) in short term. 'Make in India' seems to have been substantially slogans and defence gets caught in non-political quagmires as usual to the point where it cannot be seen as a driver of jobs. 

There are significant ancillary factors (confidence, rbi reform, infrastructure investment) etc that also impact it.",2018-02-11 14:28:38

**Narendra Modi to lay foundation stone for Abu Dhabi's first Indian temple** 

 ______ 
ABU DHABI: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

will tomorrow witness the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the first Hindu
temple in the capital of the UAE, home to over three million people of Indian
origin.

Temple Committee members presented the temple literature to Modi, who arrived
here tonight, and Crown

Prince

of Abu Dhabi Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

""This will be the first stone temple to be built in Abu Dhabi off Dubai-Abu
Dhabi highway,"" Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar
tweeted.

Modi is visiting the United Arab Emirates for the second time after his 2015
trip to the country.

""The first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi will come up on 55,000 square metres of
land and the groundbreaking ceremony on Sunday will be a historic event,"" said
Indian Ambassador to the UAE

Navdeep Singh

Suri.

The Indian Prime Minister will flag off laying of the temple's foundation
stone during the community event.

""On Sunday, you will see a groundbreaking ceremony, which is going to be live-
streamed into Dubai Opera House. It's going to be tradition meeting
technology,"" Suri said.

Modi will hold a meeting with the Indian community at Dubai Opera House, he
said, adding that representatives of all major organisations and a number of
Indian professionals have been invited.

""The occasion is going to be historic for a different reason because it will
also see the commencement of the first Hindu Temple in Abu Dhabi. We are very
pleased that we have received 55,000 square metres of land near Al Rahba off
the Dubai-Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Highway,"" Suri said.

The temple will be hand-carved by Indian temple artisans and assembled in the
UAE. It will be completed by 2020, and open to people of all religious
backgrounds.

It will be the first traditional Hindu stone temple in the Middle East, said a
spokesperson from the BAPS.

Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), is a socio-
spiritual Hindu organisation set up in 1907 that runs more than 1,100 temples
and cultural compounds around the world.

The temple will incorporate all aspects and features of a traditional Hindu
temple as part of a fully functional, social, cultural and spiritual complex.

It will replicate the BAPS temple in New Delhi and the one under construction
in New Jersey, a trust member told Khaleej Times.

The investment from the UAE to

India

exceeds $11 billion.

They should've been wary of the vendetta that gets played in politics. It's not like they weren't aware of such things. There's no excuse for this and damage that's been done is quite visible.
Then, in Punjab they started celebrating their win with such pomp and show even before the results, it was total cringefest. This made them a tool of mockery once again! They never learn. They need to learn how to lay low and let their actions speak louder! One mistake and nobody ever takes you seriously again. This is politics.

**Start working because you don’t have much time, Rahul Gandhi tells PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Congress president Rahul Gandhi continued his attack on Prime Minister
Narendra Modi on Sunday, saying it was time he began delivering on his 2014
election promises of depositing Rs 15 lakh in every bank account and providing
20 million jobs a year.

“Modiji please stop talking and start working because you don’t have much
time...In four years you haven’t even opened your account,” he said.

Gandhi was speaking at Karatagi town in Koppal district, about 385 km north of
Bengaluru, on the second day of his four-day Janashirvada Yatra as part of the
campaign for the upcoming assembly elections in Karnataka. He said while Modi
liked to quote 12th century philosopher Basavanna, who is considered the
founder of the Lingayat sect, he had scant regard for his philosophy. “Modi
likes to refer to Basavanna, who had said work is divine, but he does not
follow that dictum and only talks,” Gandhi said.

“There are two types of governments. One that gives away the nation’s wealth
to the rich, and another which redistributes wealth to the poor.”

Gandhi said while Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah agreed to waive farm
loans in no time, the Modi government had refused to do so.

He said the Modi government works only for the rich and urged the PM to waive
farm loans.

He claimed industrialists in the country have debts of around Rs 10 lakh
crore, which were slowly being written off by the central government.

“However, despite having the money, the Modi government does not waive loans
of farmers, who are the backbone of the country,” he said.

The Congress president said the BJP had mocked former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi when he mooted the proposal to develop the Information Technology
sector. “But he laid his trust in the people of Karnataka and I want to thank
you for making India proud,” he said.

Later in the day, addressing farmers in Sindhanur town in Raichur district,
Gandhi said Modi had a habit of looking into the past instead of working.

The Congress president said Modi should learn from Siddaramaiah and not make
allegations of corruption, while having former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa
on the dais.

“Modi has a propensity to look behind. He should also see who is sitting next
to him on the stage before calling the current government corrupt,” Gandhi
said.

Gandhi claimed that while China created 50,000 jobs a day, the Modi government
could only generate 450 jobs a day.

He said the Prime Minister had launched a two-pronged attack on farmers
through demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

“It wasn’t an attack on corruption, it was against farmers...you were made to
stand in queues outside banks while the rich entered banks through the back
door and converted their black money to white,” Gandhi said.

The state BJP described Gandhi’s claims as a bundle of lies. “He failed to
provide any evidence to support his allegations,” BJP spokesperson S Prakash
said.

According to Prakash, the industrial class Gandhi accused Modi of favouring
had thrived under the UPA government. “Rather than concentrating on the Prime
Minister, he would be better advised to ask the state government about its
failures,” he said.

**Rs 23,000 Crore Printed, But Didn't Reach RBI Before Demonetisation: 10 Things To Know** 

 ______ 
A public interest litigation -- probably holding the key to the historic
demonetisation of November 8, 2016 -- filed by RTI activist Manoranjan Roy
will finally come up for hearing at Bombay High Court here on February 12. The
PIL was filed in 2015, on the basis of RTI replies received from the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) and other institutions, pertaining to large quantities of
""missing or excess"" Indian currency notes.

Roy said that as per RTI replies, from 2000 to 2011, RBI had received a
certain number of currency notes from the three security printing presses in
Nashik, Dewas and Mysuru.

**Ten Things To know About Discrepancy Between Notes Printed And Received By RBI**

1\. There was discrepancy between the number of rupee notes printed by the
presses and the figure released by the RBI. The figures provided by the
printing presses were: Rs. 500 denomination -- 19,45,40,00,000 pieces were
sent to RBI, but RBI said it had received only 18,98,46,84,000 pieces: A
shortfall of 46,93,16,000 pieces or Rs. 23,465 crore.

2\. The printing presses said in the RTI that they had sent Rs 1,000
denomination 4,44,13,00,000 pieces, but the RBI's data for the corresponding
number was 4,45,30,00,000 pieces: An excess of 1,17,00,000 pieces or Rs. 1,170
crore.

3\. In another RTI data for 2000-2011, from the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note
Mudran Pvt. Ltd. said it had sent 13,35,60,00,000 pieces of Rs. 500
denomination and 3,35,48,60,000 pieces of Rs. 1,000 denomination, but,
mysteriously, the RBI apparently never received these currency notes, nor did
it disclose details of the same, said Roy.

4\. The RTI activist expressed surprise at the discrepancy of figures released
by different agencies. ""How such entirely misleading figures were given by
three different and highly responsible government institutions, who are the
culprits indulging in the misappropriation, where the staggering amounts of
currency notes printed are actually going, are some of the questions that
arise, and the answers may come out when my petition is finally heard,"" Roy
said.

5\. In the petition, Roy had named the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister
and the Ministry of Home Affairs, as parties. However, at one of the early
hearings, then Additional Solicitor-General of India, Anil Singh, submitted an
affidavit to Roy on January 27, 2016, asking him to delete the names of the
PM, FM and MHA.

6\. Roy's lawyer, Shashikant Chaudhari, said the case went to a bench of
Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Prakash Naik on March 29, 2016, with subsequent
dates of April 11, 2016, and then listed as a fresh matter on June 17, 2016.

7\. Justice V.M. Kanade and Justice Swapna S. Joshi disposed off the petition
on August 23, 2016, ""without proper scrutiny"".

8\. On September 22, 2016, Roy filed a Review Petition (No. 5/2016) and the
matter remained alive, and now this review plea will come up for hearing next
Monday, Chaudhari said.

9\. Meanwhile, barely within 75 days of the petition getting disposed off
(August 23, 2016), Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of
the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations, on November 8, 2016, the lawyer said.

10\. The government move was made on various grounds like unearthing black
money and fighting terrorism, but the entire matter pertaining to
misappropriation of large quantities of Indian currency notes, as available
under RTI, was sidelined, Roy claimed.

**SP leader Naresh Agarwal's casteist comment against PM Modi triggers row** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

Samajwadi Party

MP

Naresh Agarwal

landed himself in hot water after making casteist comments against Prime
Minister

Narendra Modi

at the

All India Vaishya Mahasammelan

today.

Members of the audience strongly objected to Agarwal's remarks against the
prime minister while he was still speaking at the dais. They caused a
commotion, demanding the SP lawmaker to apologise for uttering the slur.

When he refused to take back the remarks, some members of the audience created
an uproar, making it difficult for Agarwal to continue with his speech. The
event organisers stepped in to restore peace but it proved ineffectual.

Amid these chaotic scenes, Agarwal, who was the chief guest at the event,
directed his ire at the media and ordered them out. Despite concerted efforts
by the organisers, order could not be restored and the programme was called
off midway.

As he was leaving the venue, a defiant Agarwal said he stood by his statement,
asserting that caste was a reality of Indian society and nobody can avoid it.

The Working Committee of the All India Vaishya met at a private hotel in

Hazratganj

today. In this meeting, the organization was expanded and a unit was formed in
every district.

**Nagaland Assembly election: Baptist church body appeals political parties not to support BJP** 

 ______ 
Written by

Kallol Dey

| Dimapur |

Updated: February 11, 2018 11:34 pm

PM Narendra Modi (left) and BJP chief Amit Shah.

The ‘RSS brand’ of politics of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has
come to haunt the party in the Christian majority states of Nagaland and
Meghalaya this election February. In Nagaland, elections are fought more on
tribal, village and individual lines than by manifestos or ideologies of
political parties. Given that all candidates are usually Christians, religion
too does not count in electoral politics. But this time around, religion has
cast shadow on the elections with the Baptist church launching a rather
unprecedented direct attack on BJP by calling on ‘believers’ not to surrender
Christian principles and faith for the sake of money and development into the
hands of those who seek to “pierce the heart of Jesus Christ.”

The Nagaland Baptist Churches Council (NBCC), apex body of Baptist churches in
the state, in an open letter to presidents of all political parties in
Nagaland, stated that India had experienced the worst persecution of minority
communities in 2015-2017 under the RSS-backed BJP government. “We cannot deny
that the Hindutva movement in the country has become unprecedentedly strong
and invasive in the last few years with BJP, the political wing of RSS, in
power,” the NBCC general secretary observed in the letter adding that “God
must be weeping when Naga politicians are running after those who seek to
destroy Christianity in India and in our land.”

When asked about the unprecedented stand taken by the church, Rev. Zelhou
Keyho, the NBCC general secretary, talking to indianexpress.com said, “This
time it has really become a threat (RSS-backed BJP). That is why we felt we
had to make a strong statement not only on behalf of the church here but also
on behalf of Christians in the country in general.”

The church leader is wary about the political ambitions of the BJP in the
three Christian dominated states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram. “It is
not just political interest,” he claimed but eluded substantiating on what
agenda the BJP-RSS combine has in North East. He pointed out the conferences
being hosted in Assam by the RSS and said the “tremors are being felt in
Meghalaya and Nagaland.”

**BJP’s strategic alliances**

Despite a growing presence, BJP has been on the backfoot in both Nagaland and
Meghalaya for issues like ‘beef ban’ and atrocities against minorities,
particularly Christians. That has apparently driven the BJP to go into the
polls with strategic alliances with regional parties. In Nagaland, the BJP
sealed alliance with the Nationalist Democratic People’s Party (NDPP). Asked
about the BJP-NDPP alliance, Rev. Keyho said, “At this moment, I will not be
able to comment on NDPP but getting a regional party has emboldened the BJP.”
He added that “while politicians will say BJP is only a political party and we
are not part of RSS, it is just political talk.”

The Baptist church leader further said that in a big country like India whose
beauty lies in its diversity of cultures, traditions and practices, it is
wrong to say that that the country has only one religion. “Considering
Christianity a foreign religion (in India) is strange. Hinduism is practiced
in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand as well. So if those people say that
Hinduism is a foreign religion, get out of the country, we will surely feel
bad.” Rev. Keyho categorically added, “The beauty of the secular nature of the
country has to be preserved (sic).”

The Nagaland BJP is yet to reply to the NBCC general secretary’s open letter.
When indianexpress.com contacted M Chuba, Nagaland BJP campaign committee
incharge, he said the NBCC statement is “kind of a threat for us.”

“What the church said about us (BJP) is totally opposite to what we stand for.
We stand for development. There are no proper roads, electricity and demand
for students’ scholarship is responded with water cannons; so many anti-
incumbency factors. Our objective is to focus on development and preserve our
own identity,” Chuba asserted. On equating BJP with RSS, he said that the two
are different organisations. “RSS is kind of a national volunteers
organisation, BJP is a political party. The NBCC general secretary is
confused.”

Meanwhile, the Congress has gone on an all out attack on the RSS. In a recent
press conference in Dimapur, Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi, who is also Congress
observer for Nagaland elections, said the RSS-backed BJP is manipulating
democracy and constitutional values. “This BJP doesn’t believe in people
power. It is of the RSS, for the RSS and by the RSS… Christmas has been
converted into Good Governance Day, Easter has been converted into Digital
India Day and for the first time it is rather unfortunate that the Rashtrapati
Bhavan did not hear Christmas carols during last Christmas,” Gogoi said.

**$3.6 billion in hidden bad loans spotlight Indian banking stress** 

 ______ 
**By Anto Antony**

India's regulator unearthed about $3.6 billion of

bad loans

in the books of the country's biggest bank, amplifying questions about
distress in the financial sector given underreporting by some rivals as well.

State Bank of India on Friday said an audit by the central bank showed soured
debt was about 232 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) higher than what the state-
run lender reported for the end of March 2017. The biggest private lender HDFC
Bank Ltd. had a 20.5 billion rupee divergence, while ICICI Bank Ltd. said --
without elaborating -- that it isn't required to make disclosures on the topic
even as provisions for bad loans climbed. It had reported a divergence in the
previous year.

Indian banks must disclose such discrepancies if the gap between reported
numbers and the RBI's audit findings is more than 15 percent. State Bank of
India's admission is particularly striking because the lender is often seen as
a proxy for the nation's economy, where the ratio of bad loans has surged to
be among the highest in the world. The problem has grabbed so many headlines
that Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited it to attack the policies of his
predecessor in parliament last week.

""If India's premier state-run bank is reporting such divergence it shows how
deep the rot runs in the nation's banking system,"" said Hemindra Hazari, a
Mumbai-based independent banking analyst who has covered the sector for two
decades and publishes at Smartkarma.com. ""Cleaning up this mess is going to
take much more effort and time than what people expect.""

State Bank of India's shares fell 1.7 percent to 296.4 rupees in Mumbai on
Friday, extending this year's drop to 4.4 percent.

Most of the accounts identified by the RBI in its risk assessment were already
on the stressed asset list ""in one way or another,"" State Bank of India
Chairman

Rajnish Kumar

said in a conference call with reporters. The bulk of the divergence -- about
100 billion rupees -- came from the power sector, he said.

Divergences occurred earlier as well, though what's changed is the mandatory
disclosure of the gaps, central bank Deputy Governor N S Vishwanathan said
last month.

**Unnerving Divergence**

The regulator has also sought to reclassify loans given by a consortium as
non-performing for all the lenders involved if it was considered non-
performing on the books of one of them, as part of tighter asset
classification norms that came into effect from 2016.

""The divergence in asset quality from numbers reported earlier is unnerving,""
said Asutosh Kumar Mishra, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at

Reliance Securities Ltd

. ""While the loan growth is showing early signs of revival, provisions for bad
loans will continue to weigh on profit growth in coming quarters.""

State Bank of India on Friday reported a 24.2 billion rupee loss for the
quarter ended Dec. 31, its first in at least 17 years. Analysts in a Bloomberg
survey had predicted a 20.6 billion rupee profit.

The loss was due to hardening bond yields, treasury declines and provisions
for payments to employees, Chairman Kumar said during the conference call.

""I don't want to be very optimistic about the March quarter, nor am I
pessimistic,"" Kumar said. ""We can hope for a much better performance in terms
of most performance parameters"" in the financial year starting April 1, he
added.

**Narendra Modi asks Shah and Jaitley to placate Naidu** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

BJP

is making all efforts to reason with ally TDP on its various demands for
Andhra Pradesh, with PM Modi keeping a tab on the developments. But chief
minister

N Chandrababu Naidu

is not satisfied with the assurances and his MPs have threatened to walk out
of NDA if the demands are not met.

Modi has given the responsibility of placating TDP chief to

BJP president Amit Shah

and FM

Arun Jaitley

. He has also promised TDP leaders that he will get in touch with Naidu to
sort out the issues, sources said. Last week saw hectic activities from both
sides, with TDP protesting in Parliament and near the Mahatma Gandhi statue on
the premises. TDP MPs raised slogans and displayed placards in the Well of the
House.

YSRCP and some Congress MPs from Andhra too protested to press for giving more
funds to Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra CM was away in the UAE last week, but soon
after he returned on Friday he got a call from Shah. Modi is likely to speak
to Naidu after he returns from the four-nation tour. Modi has asked Shah and
Jaitley to mediate. The FM gave some assurances in his reply to the budget
debate in both the Houses, but this hasn't satisfied TDP.

The two BJP leaders are likely to hold discussions with TDP leaders this week.
Naidu has had his way with the Centre during the Deve Gowda and AB Vajpayee
governments, but does not have much bargaining power with the present
dispensation as BJP has a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. TDP is bargaining
hard and protesting aggressively to get more funds for building the new Andhra
capital in Amravati, the Polavaram project and a new railway zone at
Vishakapatnam.

""Naidu should realise that he can get more from Modi by discussing the issues.
The prime minister is not the type who will yield under pressure,"" a senior
BJP leader said.

Another senior BJP leader said the Centre found that Naidu has waived some
farmer loans and incurred other expenditure, but is demanding reimbursement
from the NDA government for them. Pandering to his request will lead to a
flood of similar requests from other states, including those ruled by BJP, a
situation the Centre does not want to get into.

BJP leaders are aware that TDP may finally pull out of NDA though after a few
months and closer to the elections — assembly polls in Andhra will be held
along with the Lok Sabha polls early next year. This may help TDP pin the
blame for not doing enough for AP on the Centre's ""non-cooperation"".

**India, Oman sign 8 agreements as PM Narendra Modi meets Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said** 

 ______ 
MUSCAT: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

today held wide-ranging talks with the Sultan of Oman as the two sides signed
eight agreements, including pacts on cooperation in the field of defence,
health and tourism.

Modi, who arrived here from Dubai on the last leg of his three-nation tour,
led delegation-level talks with Qaboos bin Said al Said and discussed measures
to strengthen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, defence, security,
food security and regional issues.

""Charting out new frontiers in our bilateral relationship, PM @narendramodi
led delegation-level talks with Sultan Qaboos of Oman. The two strategic
partners discussed to strengthen cooperation in trade &amp;amp; investment,
energy, defence &amp;amp; security, food security and regional issues,"" Ministry
of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted.

Sultan Qaboos appreciated the contribution of ""honest and hard working"" Indian
nationals in the development of Oman.

After their talks, the two sides signed eight agreements, including an MoU on
legal and judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters.

They also signed an agreement on mutual visa exemption for holders of
diplomatic, special, service and official passports and an MoU on cooperation
in the field of health, tourism and peaceful uses of outer space.

The two countries also signed an agreement on cooperation between Foreign
Service Institute, Ministry of External Affairs,

India

and Oman's Diplomatic Institute.

An MoU on academic and scholarly cooperation between National Defence College,
Sultanate of Oman and the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.

The two sides also signed annexutre to the MoU on military cooperation.

During his two-day visit, Modi will also meet Deputy Prime Minister for the
Council of Ministers Sayyid Fahd bin Mahmoud Al Said and Deputy Prime Minister
for International Relations and Cooperation Affairs Sayyid Asa'ad bin Tariq Al
Said.

Earlier, addressing the Indian diaspora at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex in
Oman's capital, Modi said the ties of India and Oman have always remained
strong despite the ups and downs in the political environment in both the
countries.

He also said that Indian diaspora has played an essential role in
strengthening these ties.

India and Oman have thriving links rooted in centuries old people-to-people
exchanges, Modi said.

More than nine million

Indians

work and live in the Gulf region. In Oman, they constitute the largest
expatriate community.

On the first leg of his trip, Modi had travelled to Ramallah, becoming the
first Indian prime minister to make an official visit to Palestine. From there
he visited the UAE, before arriving in Oman.

**NITI Aayog wrote the National Medical Commission bill to get its way, and how**

A king may consider the advice of his councillors and the demands of his people but can do whatever he wants. It turns out, so can a group of ministers in a democracy. Everyone who presented their views to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health had one thing to say—the government’s mind is made up. And it looks like that it is in the favour of probably the most controversial legislation proposed by the Modi government—the National Medical Commision Bill. 

The committee has been asked to submit its report soon, ideally by the end of this week. “The bill will go through. It may take longer than planned. It may have minor modifications. But the health sector would transform, even if it means biting a bitter pill,” said a government executive in the know who requested not to be named.

The bitter pill is the frustration of Indian doctors, who, under the banner of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), went on a 12-hour strike to make their point on 2 January. IMA represents over 2,00,000 Indian doctors. Behind closed doors, the doctors representing IMA were fuming because they were left out of the process of making the bill. They were not alone, the public health experts feel left out, too. Although they were invited by NITI Aayog to contribute, their suggestions never made it into the final bill.

What is it about this one legislation that has them up in arms? Put simply, it is this bill’s intention to dilute the rigour, skill and qualification needed to treat a patient. Written by a three-member committee, none of whom are doctors themselves, the bill is a quick fix to meet Indian healthcare’s biggest challenge—the shortage of doctors.

The government plans to make a few big moves to make access-to-health its political achievement. A budget announcement last Friday to provide health insurance cover of Rs 5,00,000 to 100 million families was one. Passing the National Medical Commission Bill is next on its agenda. And it is willing to do just anything to have its way. The process of writing the bill shows how.

While the erstwhile Planning Commission wrote five-year plans, committee reports and white papers to assist legal change, its successor NITI Aayog has now started encroaching on ministry territory, starting with writing the bill. This is the first time that NITI Aayog has written a legislation, which, as it turns out, benefits hospitals more than patients.

The think tank has proposed to lower the quality of doctors, deregulate the medical education industry, and let Ayurveda or Homeopathy doctors prescribe allopathic medicines after taking a bridge course, officially. In short, it has attempted to quickly fix the problem of doctor shortage in India. Will NITI Aayog be the first Indian think tank to bring in legal change despite stiff opposition? A feat none of the earlier proposals to increase the number of doctors in the country—most recently the National Commission for Human Resources for Health Bill, 2011—in the last five decades, were able to accomplish.

**It smells fishy**

The four walls of NITI Aayog seemed familiar to the invitees. The rooms once belonged to the Planning Commission, where expert committee members used to inform and recommend the government. This meeting was different—the seven invitees were neither members of a committee nor did they have the power to recommend anything.

It was 12 April 2016. The hosts Arvind Panagariya and Amitabh Kant, PK Mishra, and BP Sharma represented NITI Aayog, the Prime Minister and the Health Ministry, respectively. They were consulting Dr Devi Shetty, chairman and Founder of Narayana Health, a chain of 26 medical centres in India; Dr KK Talwar, Chairman, Department of Cardiology, Max Healthcare; Professor JM Kaul of Maulana Azad Medical College, among others, to begin the most unusual process of drafting a legislation.

First, everyone found it strange that there was no medical professional in the committee, said a doctor-educator who was invited to the meeting and who requested not to be named. Second, the committee was set up by the PM in March 2016 under the Chairmanship of Panagariya, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog ‘to examine all options for reforms in the Medical Council of India, the medical education regulator, and to suggest a way forward’. By the end of the first consultation itself, it had decided to introduce a new law, he added.

“Their job was to suggest a way to increase the number of seats and the number of medical colleges but they decided to write a legislation instead. A task entrusted to ministries. This is not how legislations are made or even committee reports prepared,” the doctor-educator mentioned above said. He has been a part of former committees that aimed to do just that—revise the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. But never before was the process so opaque and a proposed legislation leaning towards AYUSH doctors and private investment so stark.

NITI Aayog has attributed the seed of both clauses (that would help create more doctors and specialists) in the bill to this very consultation meeting and the two more that followed. The invitees, however, do not remember any mention of AYUSH and they remember vehemently asking for strict control on the quality of postgraduate medical education.

For instance, according to the minutes of the 29 April 2016 meeting (the second invite-only meeting), former health secretaries, medical educators and doctors decided to ‘mainstream AYUSH doctors’. Although, when The Ken spoke to most of the participants, they did not remember AYUSH doctors being mentioned. “I can vouch that AYUSH was never discussed, let alone deciding to mainstream it,” said Professor Gautam Sen, owner of Wellspring Healthcare, who had attended the meeting.

Further, former health secretary Sujatha Rao had suggested the same standard of quality for post-graduate diploma and degree, used by private and public-funded medical colleges, respectively. “This has been suggested over and over again in the past committees, too. However, NITI Aayog has subtly ignored the recommendation again in the final bill,” the doctor and educator quoted above told The Ken.

The four committee members, unfazed, met on 25 May 2016 to flesh out the bill, met the Prime Minister on 29 July 2016, included his suggestions and published the first draft of the bill. 

**Say what you will: hospitals versus doctors**

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Association of Healthcare Providers (AHPI) had reached an impasse. After taking to streets on 2 January, in the second week, the IMA, after being sidelined for two years, finally got a chance to speak, on invitation by the Standing Committee. 

“We want the government to invest more in building medical colleges. It is the ideal solution, but since that is beyond the scope of one committee, it fell on deaf ears,” said a representative of the IMA who requested not to be named. “In its current form, the bill legitimises quackery, students with deep pockets and private medical colleges; in the end, someone who is barely a doctor may treat people.”

The Standing Committee, according to him, is defending the bill as they want to invite more investment in the private medical education. Currently, out of over 450 medical colleges, nearly half are government hospitals and the private medical education market is expected to be $8.72 billion in two years. These are the same medical colleges that can sell up to 40% of seats at any price they want and capture the demand from Indians leaving India to study medicine. 

“The quality of a doctor is a lovely subject. It gives specialist doctors more leverage as they remain limited in number, demand higher salaries and jobs only in cosmopolitan cities,” said the owner of a large hospital chain. He is not hopeful about the enactment of the bill after attending the consultation hosted by the committee. But either way, it wouldn’t have changed the everyday working of a hospital because they have already found alternatives.

**RSS can get war-ready in three days, Army needs months, says Mohan Bhagwat** 

 ______ 
RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was speaking in Muzaffarpur where he met Sangh
volunteers from Bihar and Jharkhand

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that the RSS
can raise a force and get battle-ready in just three days even as the Army
would need “six to seven months” to carry out the same task. Addressing the
orgaisation’s workers at Zila school ground in Muzaffarpur, Bhagwat said that
RSS is not a military organisation, but it has military discipline. He further
said that if the country requires it and the Constitution (permits), then the
Army would take six to seven months to get war-ready. However, RSS volunteers
will take three days and this is RSS’ capability.”

Bhagwat was speaking in Muzaffarpur where he met Sangh volunteers from Bihar
and Jharkhand as part of his 10-day visit to Bihar where the leader also held
a review meeting of various Sangh wings. Hailing RSS as a “parivarik
sangathan” (family organisation), Bhagwat said that it practises discipline
like the Army and that its workers are always willing to make the supreme
sacrifice for their country. Bhagwat has also encouraged the RSS workers to
set an example of good conduct in their personal, family and social life.

Bhagwat has also urged farmers to join the Sangh and become a part of its
mission to build a society free from discrimination. He has also highlighted
the work done by swayamsevaks in villages of the country. The RSS
Sarsanghchalak said that the problems faced by villages can be solved by only
those who live in villages. The RSS has been in close touch with rural India,
Bhagwat said.

The RSS chief’s tour of the state that is scheduled to conclude on February 15
has drawn criticism from Opposition parties. The RJD and the Congress have
alleged that Bhagwat’s visits have become frequent off late and it was a part
of the agenda of the BJP to “saffronize” Bihar. They have also accused Chief
Minister Nitish Kumar of having capitulated before the BJP, and taunted him
over his 2016 resolve of making India “RSS-free” when he had been heading an
anti-BJP coalition government. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar
Modi said Bhagwat was meeting farmers with a view to helping them make their
own lives better.

**As Canadian gurdwaras ban Indian diplomats, fears of a new Sikh uprising emerge** 

 ______ 
A little over a year ago, Indian consul general Dinesh Bhatia arrived at the
Ontario Khalsa Darbar, better known as the Dixie Gurdwara, in the Toronto
suburb of Mississauga. He was there to attend a ceremony in memory of a senior
member of the community who had recently passed away. He was accompanied by
two members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP -- part of the
protective detail provided by the Canadian government to Indian diplomats in
the country. As some members of the gurdwara professed anger over the presence
of the policemen, the incident set off a chain of events leading to the
boycott of Indian officials by multiple gurdwaras across Canada — a phenomenon
that later spread to other nations such as the UK, the US, and Australia.

The disquiet may have been caused less by the Mounties and more by an Indian
diplomat entering the premises of a place like the Dixie Gurdwara, once
considered off limits for New Delhi’s envoys to Canada. It drew an immediate
reaction from hardliners such as the activist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).
By February, the group had sent a communiqué to Canada’s foreign affairs
minister Chrystia Freeland, asking her “to take notice of the activities of
the Indian diplomats posted in Canada which have the potential of creating
disharmony and discontent among the peaceful Canadian Sikh community”.

“Approaching the foreign minister is an initial step towards blocking Indian
diplomats from attending events in Canadian Gurdwaras,” the SFJ’s legal
advisor Gurpatwant Singh Pannun warned.

As 2017 wound down, those words proved prophetic. While the original Punjab
separatist movement of the 1980s was rooted in Punjab, and thereafter spread
abroad, a new version of the campaign is slowly emerging. The ban is one
manifestation — being spurred by the diaspora, particularly in Canada. The
objective, which worries the governments in both New Delhi and Chandigarh, is
to have it exported back into India as the second coming of Khalistan.

At a meeting on December 30 at the Jot Prakash Gurdwara in the Canadian city
of Brampton, the Ontario Gurdwara Committee (OGC), which claims to represent
nearly 15 gurdwaras in the province, imposed a ban on Indian officials,
including elected representatives, from entering their premises while in their
official capacities. Among those leading the group was Dixie Gurdwara’s
president Gurpreet Singh Bal, who said the reasons behind the move included
“the Indian government’s interference in the community”. Within days, the
boycott movement had spread across other Canadian provinces of Quebec, British
Columbia and Alberta, and beyond its borders to America, the UK, and most
recently, Melbourne in Australia. “Soon after we made the announcement,
support started pouring in from various countries. The only reason that came
to my mind is that in every country the Sikh community was suffering from
Indian consulate’s infiltration,” said Sukhminder Singh Hansra, president of
the Shiromani Akali Dal (Canada East) and a prominent pro-Khalistan activist.

A senior Indian official was disturbed by the development. “It’s totally
coordinated,” he said, requesting anonymity. Other than India’s deputy high
commissioner in the UK, diplomats have refrained from commenting on this
issue, pointing instead to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs
spokesperson, who noted: “We take no cognisance of fringe elements which
spread hate and communal disharmony.”

But the government has certainly been taken unawares by the move. Vishnu
Prakash, who was till October 2016 India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, said,
“I did not see this coming. One of the tenets of Sikhism is that places of
worship are open to everybody. This is what they take pride in. I think this
is a rather unfortunate development and I get a sense that radicals have
become emboldened.”

AS THE BAN VIRUS SPREADS

From Canada, the phenomenon later reached other nations such as the UK, the
US, and Australia

**2017****◼** **January:**

India’s Consul General in Toronto, Dinesh Bhatia, visits Dixie gurdwara, a
temple once considered a bastion of extremist elements.

**◼** **February :**

Sikhs for Justice writes to Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs complaining
about such visits by Indian officials.

**◼** **December 30:**

Ontario Gurdwara Committee announces ban on Indian officials visiting 15
temples in the province.

**2018****◼** **January 4:**

Some gurdwaras in British Columbia and Alberta join the ban.

**◼** **January 5:**

Similar ban in proposed in the United Kingdom.

**◼** **January 7:**

Gurdwaras in Quebec join; a similar announcement relating to gurdwaras in the
United States is issued in New York.

**◼** **January 10:**

MEA states it takes ""no cognisance of fringe elements which spread hate and
communal disharmony.""

**◼** **Mid-January:**

Members of managements of three gurdwaras announce this was not a decision
taken by their executive committees, refute ban. This includes Dixie Gurdwara.

**◼** **January 22:**

Gurdwara in Melbourne, Australia, announces ban.

**◼** **January 25:**

Two more gurdwara managements in Ontario state they were not consulted while
imposing ban; say they ""never consented"" to decision.

In fact, the Narendra Modi government had introduced a slew of measures to woo
some hardliners away from separatism. That outreach effort commenced with his
bilateral visit to Canada, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 42 years,
in 2015. Among the stops on his schedule was the Khalsa Diwan Society’s
historic Ross Street Gurdwara in Vancouver. The visa blacklist was pruned,
even refugees were given travel documents, back-channel talks with some
Khalistanis started, and visits by Indian officials to gurdwaras was part of
the package.

As these initiatives were undertaken, extremist elements criticised each of
these measures, particularly that of Indian diplomats visiting gurdwaras
earlier considered off limits for them. There was anger at these bastions
being breached. The backlash focused on the government behind the moves, the
BJP-led NDA administration. This led to the recent inclusion on members of the
BJP’s parent organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, in the proscribed
list.

Though the movement espousing the ban on Indian officials has been widespread,
it has also suffered from pushback. Four members of the management committee
of the Dixie Gurdwara came out against the ban stating they “were not aware of
this decision, and this issue was never discussed in the committee meeting and
no resolution was passed”. They were joined by two more gurdwaras in Brampton.
In recent days, the Sikh Spiritual Center in Toronto also opposed the ban,
while members of the management of Sikh Society Hamilton Wentworth’s Gursikh
Temple sent a letter to the India Consulate in Toronto stating they “never
consented” to the decision taken at the OGC meet.

That, however, hasn’t fazed those behind the ban action, like Hansra, who
said, “The formal approval of the ban was not required since almost every
gurdwara already had an unwritten ban on the consulate general and Indian
officials imposed for past 30 years. Any director who does not agree with the
ban, does not change the position of the gurdwara in anyway.”

Ironically, the pro-boycott forces will not take any action against those who
oppose the ban.

Among the reasons observers see for this trend of resurgence of pro-Khalistan
sentiment in Canada is vote-bank politics. “Canada may be emerging as the
epicentre of these radical elements. They find a permissive climate there.
There is a broad level of coordination, but my sense is that there is no apex-
level coordination and other hardliners take a cue when events like these
occur. Certainly, Canada is a friendly country but it is allowing a platform
to radical elements,” Prakash said.

Shinder Purewal, professor of political science at the Kwantlen Polytechnic
University in British Columbia said, “What has prompted the move is closely
related to the success of Sikh politicians directly, or indirectly, associated
with Khalistani movement. It’s a bold move to assert the secessionist upsurge
in local, provincial and federal governments in Canada, and similarly in UK
and USA. It’s a popular move among people who are treated like sub-humans by
Indian consulate.”

The Canadian government has argued it can do little about the propagation of
Khalistan in the country due to its freedom of expression rights. But Prakash
said, “When there is a will, there are so many ways to do it. Even soft
measures can neutralise these elements.” Among those could be “their sources
of funding could come under greater scrutiny”, he felt. This matter is almost
certain to weigh upon the imminent weeklong visit of Canadian PM Justin
Trudeau to India.

For now, though, there remains concern the ban virus could spread further, as
Avtar Singh Pannu, member of the American Gurdwara Prabhandik Committee,
indicated, “After the US, we will campaign to ban the entry of Indian
diplomats across European nations also as activities of the Indian diplomats
have created disharmony and discontent among the peaceful Sikh community.”

This chorus of attacks on the Indian state across countries could crescendo
closer to the non-binding 2020 Referendum for an independent Punjab among
Sikhs abroad.****

**India wins piece of Abu Dhabi oil with stake in $6 billion field** 

 ______ 
**By Mahmoud Habboush and Anthony DiPaola**

India secured a share in Abu Dhabi's oil production for the first time after
agreeing to pay $600 million for a tenth of one of the emirate's biggest
offshore deposits.

State-owned

Oil and Natural Gas Corp

. and other Indian companies agreed to a 40-year contract for rights to pump
crude from the Lower Zakum field in partnership with Abu Dhabi National Oil
Co., according to an

Adnoc

statement. Adnoc signed the deal during a visit of Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi to the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Saturday.

Abu Dhabi, which holds most of the U.A.E.'s oil reserves, is looking for new
partners at its offshore fields as the production concession for some deposits
expires next month. Partners in Abu Dhabi's fields generally receive an amount
of

crude oil

commensurate with their stakes in return for tax and royalty payments and
investment to boost output.

The Indian companies will pay 2.2. billion dirhams ($600 million) to Abu Dhabi
for their stake in the field, according to the statement, putting the overall
value of the deposit at $6 billion. Adnoc, which retains 60 percent holdings
in its fields, aims to award rights for another 30 percent of the Lower Zakum
field as well as to two other offshore crude blocks.

The Indian consortium is made up of ONGC's wholly owned subsidiary ONGC
Videsh, the Indian Oil Corp., and

Bharat PetroResources

, which is a 100 percent subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, according
to the Adnoc statement. The concession will be operated by Adnoc Offshore, a
subsidiary of Adnoc, on behalf of all concession partners, it said.

Expanded production from its offshore reservoirs are part of Adnoc's plans to
raise its onshore and offshore production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a
day by the end of 2018, according to the statement. Adnoc offshore fields
currently produce about 1.4 million barrels a day, it said.

The current production of the Lower Zakum field is about 400,000 barrels a day
and the plan is to increase the plateau target to 450,000 barrels a day by
2025, according to a statement from ONGC Videsh.

The Indian win gives the country, one of the biggest buyers of U.A.E. crude, a
direct stake in Middle East barrels. Adnoc will be able to tap demand in the
world's second-most populous nation and expands its portfolio of partners.
Adnoc has said it received more than 10 bids from companies seeking to work on
the fields.

India is the second-biggest buyer of U.A.E. crude behind Japan, according
Bloomberg tanker tracking. Adnoc is seeking partners for its biggest fields
that will help secure market access for its crude in some of the top energy
consumers. Adnoc last year signed deals with Chinese and Korean companies to
partner in its main onshore fields for the first time. The company is also
seeking partnerships in refining and petrochemicals and may seek to buy assets
abroad to secure market share.

Adnoc also signed on Saturday an agreement with the Indian Strategic Petroleum
Reserves Ltd for a strategic crude oil storage facility in the southern Indian
city of Mangalore, according to the Adnoc statement. The agreement covers the
storage of 5.86 million barrels of Adnoc crude oil in underground facilities,
at the Karnataka facility.

""The oil storage facility will help ensure India's energy security, as well as
enable Adnoc to efficiently and competitively meet market demand in India and
across the fast developing south east Asian economies,"" it said.

**Man masturbates in Delhi bus, DU student approaches police with video** 

 ______ 
An unidentified middle-aged man masturbated inside a Delhi bus while sitting
next to a 23-year-old woman in south Delhi and allegedly tried to molest her.
The woman, a Delhi University student, reported the matter to the police with
a video of the incident after which an FIR was registered at Vasant Vihar
police station on Sunday.

The woman said no other passenger on the bus came to her support when she
raised an alarm. The incident took place around 3pm on February 7 aboard an
orange cluster bus plying on route number 774. The woman was returning home
from college when she felt the seat shaking. “I was reading a book when the
seat started shaking. I soon realised that the man sitting beside me was
indulging in something wrong. He repeatedly tried to touch my waist with his
elbow. I recorded his act on my mobile phone before calling him out,” she
said.

The woman posted the one-minute video on Twitter the following day. Even five
days after the incident, the accused remains unidentified.

“I confronted him and told him he had no shame. He appeared drunk and didn’t
seem to understand what I was saying,” she said. She further said that the
ordeal went on for about 10 minutes but the 30-odd other passengers in the bus
allegedly ignored the incident.

“One woman who too appeared to be a student just responded by saying ‘achcha’
when I mentioned the incident. The man, meanwhile, got off the bus near IIT
Delhi gate without any problems. I was shocked beyond belief and did not know
how to react with people showing apathy. I was numb,” she said.

The woman returned home and mentioned the incident to her family and that she
intended to lodge a police complaint. “But my family was hesitant. So, I
uploaded the video on Twitter and tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Delhi
chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Police and other authorities,” she said.

The woman finally decided to approach the Vasant Vihar police station on
Saturday. She said that the police were supportive, but took almost six hours
to register an FIR. “If as an educated woman, I was going to ignore the crime,
how would I expect other women to report them to police. The man has to be
punished,” she said.

Monika Bhardwaj, Additional DCP (south-west) denied any delay and said that
the FIR was registered within an hour of her complaint. “We have the suspect’s
photo and are making all efforts to identify him,” she said adding that a case
under sections pertaining to obscene acts and sexual harassment has been
registered.

In a similar incident in a local train in Mumbai in July last year, a woman
had caught a man masturbating. When she warned of police action, he allegedly
threatened her with rape.

**Rahul Gandhi asks PM Narendra Modi to speak about Jay Shah’s ‘corruption’**

poll-bound Karnataka. Photo: PTI

**Raichur: **Continuing his attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday said he should speak about allegations of corruption against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah’s son. 

Gandhi, who is on day three of his Janashirvad Yatra in poll-bound Karnataka,
said the prime minister should look “left and right” before talking of
corruption. “If you want to talk about corruption, talk a bit about Amit Shah
son’s corruption. How he made Rs80 crore out of Rs50,000 in three months. You
should also be telling this to the country,” he said.

Amit Shah has rejected allegations of corruption against his son Jay Shah, who
has filed a criminal defamation suit against the news portal which claimed his
business fortunes had zoomed after the BJP came to power in 2014.

Addressing people who had gathered to welcome him before he continued his
campaign in the state’s Hyderabad-Karnataka region, Gandhi also lashed out at
BJP leaders in the state. “Modiji you talk of corruption. Modiji, if you have
some time after talking of the past, look at your left and right sides... On
one side is (B.S.) Yeddyurappa who has been to the jail. On the other side, as
many as four (former) ministers who went to jail... and behind, 11 leaders who
had to resign on charges of corruption,” he said.

Gandhi said Modi had “failed” to create jobs and address farmer distress.
“Modiji, people of this country gave you work, farmers had given you work,
youth had told you that our competition is with China. China provides job to
50,000 youths in 24 hours. Modiji has failed,” he said.

Addressing roadside meetings in Raichur district, the Congress president also
said farmers had asked the prime minister for help. “I had personally gone to
his office and requested him to waive their loans, Narendra Modi did not even
utter a word and he kept quiet.” He referred to the loan waiver announced by
the Karnataka government and said it was the Congress that had done so.

Start giving jobs to the youth, start helping farmers by waiving their loan.
You don’t have much time. One year is left... Heard you are even planning to
advance elections. Start working, stop giving excuses,” he said. Gandhi also
took a jibe at Modi likening him to a cricketer, who bats looking at the
wicketkeeper without knowing from where the ball is coming.

Travelling in a customised bus along with other leaders from the state, Gandhi
was greeted by party workers and people who lined up on both sides of the road
at various places. Referring to various initiatives of the Congress government
like Article 371(J) of the Constitution, giving special status for Hyderabad-
Karnataka region, farm loan waiver, employment to youths, Gandhi said, “We
will work even better in the coming years on being voted to power.”

Addressing a public meeting at Sindhanur on Sunday, he had said, “If Sachin
Tendulkar would have batted looking at the wicketkeeper, could he have scored
a single run? Our prime minister is such a cricketer who looks at the
wicketkepeer and does not know from where the ball is coming from,” he said.

The Hyderabad-Karnataka region comprises the districts of Bidar, Yadgir,
Raichur, Koppal, Ballari and Kalaburagi which were part of the Nizam-ruled
Hyderabad state till 1948.

**High-speed bullet trains likely to run on short rail corridors across India, not long-distance routes** 

 ______ 
As the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project kicks off and plans are being
drawn up for a second high-speed corridor between Mumbai and Pune, the central
government is considering shorter rail corridors to make such projects more
feasible.

Authorities have arrived at this conclusion after studying high-speed rail
networks in China, spread across nearly 27,000 km, said officials involved in
the process.The study revealed that typically, commuters prefer flights to
long-distance train journeys.

  * The 12 stations on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train corridor include Mumbai, Thane, Virar, Boisar, Vapi, Bilimora, Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad and Sabarmati.
  * A team of engineers from National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), RITES Ltd, and Japan’s Kawasaki Geological Engineering visited Mumbai in December 2017 to survey the seabed, as the project will have a 21-km underground corridor.
  * The process of land acquisition for the project has been initiated both in Maharashtra and in Gujarat.
  * Other possible high-speed corridors include Mumbai-Pune, Hyderabad-Chennai, Delhi-Amritsar, Delhi-Patna, Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram, Patna-Howrah and Delhi-Jodhpur.

Short-distance corridors make the project more feasible financially. “The
fares of long-distance, high-speed trains would be nearly the same as flights,
though the travelling time will be longer than an air journey. This makes
long-distance corridors unfeasible, and that’s why long-distance bullet trains
have failed in China, too,” said a senior officer from National High Speed
Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), requesting anonymity. “So we are not
looking at long-distance corridors, we are considering short-distance routes
that connect the entire country.”

Short-distance routes that see a lot of commuter traffic, for example, include
the Delhi-Amritsar and Mumbai-Pune routes. “Currently, a Mumbai-Pune intercity
train takes around three hours. If that travel time can be cut to 60 to 90
minutes, passenger response will be tremendous,” the official said.

The Centre is planning an estimated 4,500km of high-speed rail network, and a
Delhi-Amritsar corridor is being taken up. If the high-speed train project is
completed as planned, India will be the third country in the world to have the
largest high-speed rail network, the first being China with a network of
39,000 km (this includes the projects currently under construction), followed
by Spain with 4,900 km.

In September 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for the bullet train project between
Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Work on this 508-km corridor, which will have 12
stations and a maintenance depot, has already kicked off.

Railway authorities are also planning to link the bullet train with upcoming
metro lines, as well as Central and Western Railway services.

During the Union Budget presentation, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced
that a railway university would be constructed at Vadodara, which will serve
as a training centre for manpower required for the country’s high-speed rail
projects.

**Congress dares PM Narendra Modi to dismiss Karnataka govt on corruption charge** 

 ______ 
BENGALURU: The

Congress

dared Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

to either dismiss the party's government in

Karnataka

and register cases against the corrupt, or tender an unconditional apology for
his charges against it.

The party was reacting to Modi's attack on the Siddaramaiah government at a
public rally here on Sunday.

The prime minister had accused the Congress government in Karnataka of setting
new records in corruption, dubbing it a ""10 per cent commission government"",
and said the countdown for its exit has begun.

The Karanataka unit of the Congress said Modi termed the Siddaramaiah
dispensation a ""10 per cent commission government"", and Union Minister D V
Sadananda Gowda called it a ""30 per cent commission state"".

""When you have information about corruption prevailing in the state, why not
dismiss the government by invoking Article 356 of constitution and initiate
criminal cases against those involved in corruption?"" Congress spokesperson

V S Ugrappa

told reporters here.

He said if the prime minister has information of corruption, he should present
it with facts before the people of the country.

Accusing Modi of breaching the dignity of the prime minister's office, Ugrappa
said, ""Modi lacks the statesmanship which all the prime ministers in the past
maintained throughout their tenure.""

""BJP Mukt Bharat has started from Rajasthan... I will not say we want BJP Mukt
Bharat, but I want

Modi Mukt Bharat

,"" the Congress spokesperson said.

# Modi vindicated as IIM study debunks jobless growth theory, says 15 million
added to labour force yearly

## The Narendra Modi-led government got a big boost as a new study finds that
15 million people are being added to the labour force every year, busting the
theory that jobs are not being created in the country.

The study, titled “Towards a Payroll Reporting in India”, estimated that 3.68
million jobs were generated till November of FY18, which would imply 5.5
million in the entire year. (Image: Reuters)

The Narendra Modi-led government got a big boost as a new study finds that 15
million people are being added to the labour force every year, busting the
theory that jobs are not being created in the country. The study, authored by
SBI group Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh and Pulak Ghosh, said,
“Given declining population, we estimate that on an average 25 million babies
born per year (this has been calculated after adjusting infant morality rate
from crude birth rate) has remained largely constant in the last three
decades. Out of 25 million, we expect that 15 million are added to labour
force (after conservatively assuming 40% of them voluntarily remain out of
labour force or are involved in domestic/agriculture work).”

Earlier in November, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had launched an
attack on the government asking them to quit if they’re incapable in providing
jobs. “Mehngi gas, mehnga ration, band karo khokhla bhashan, daam bandho, kaam
do, varna khali karo singhasan,” he had tweeted in November.

The study also calculated the number of jobs in enterprises from the
membership of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Employees’ State
Insurance Corporation, General Provident Fund and National Pension System
(NPS). Interestingly, the study is the first of its kind to use these kinds of
data sets.

Eartlier, former NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya, had also
recommended using this kind of database in a report submitted by task force on
employment. “Unfortunately in India, we don’t have any proper source either to
measure the total work force or the total individuals on payroll. To make an
effort in this direction, we collected primary data from three major sources,
EPFO, ESIC and NPS,” says the report.

The study, titled “Towards a Payroll Reporting in India”, estimated that 3.68
million jobs were generated till November of FY18, which would imply 5.5
million in the entire year. “Based on all estimates, payroll of 5.9 lakh (i.e.
7 million annual) generated every month in India in current fiscal,” the
report added.

Interestingly, the study has zeroed in only new contributors who were 18-25
years old, to ensure they were capturing only new employees. Further, new
employee accounts that didn’t have steady EPFO contributions were also dropped
on the grounds they may be fraud accounts. All data pertain to the formal
sector as informal sector employees don’t contribute to EPFO. In addition, the
authors say there is also considerable employment generated from other sectors
like education. In the automobiles sector alone, based on automobile sales,
they estimate this sector generated 2 million driver jobs in FY17.

The authors have also provided various suggestions to the government,
reproduced below.

It should be mandatory for the professional bodies, hospitals, nursing homes
etc. to submit the details of new joinees every 3 month to the local
Government offices.

From April 1, 2018 Government should ask every GST filer for giving total
number of permanent employees on payroll and total no of contract employees on
payroll Some tax deduction (per person) may be given for domestic help, if
their name and details are registered with tax authorities by the household
employing them.

Currently NPS give extra tax deductions of Rs 50,000 p.a. Government should
continue this incentive and provide new incentives also to encourage people to
join NPS.

Earlier, the congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said, that the prime minister
should say if he is unable to address the problems like unemployment and the
Congress will come and do it in six months. “Farmers and youth are the two
main issues concerning India and if Modiji cannot address these, he should say
so and the Congress will come and do it in six months,” Congress Vice
-president Rahul Gandhi had said during the recent Uttar Prasdesh polls.

# India gets access to strategic Oman port for military use, Chabahar-Gwadar
in sight

## This is part of India’s maritime strategy to counter Chinese influence and
activities in the region. This was one of the key takeaways of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi’s visit to Oman over the last two days.

IN A strategic move to expand its footprint in the Indian Ocean region, India
has secured access to the key Port of Duqm in Oman for military use and
logistical support, top sources have told The Indian Express. This is part of
India’s maritime strategy to counter Chinese influence and activities in the
region. This was one of the key takeaways of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s
visit to Oman over the last two days. He met Sultan of Oman Sayyid Qaboos bin
Said Al Said, and an annexure to the Memorandum of Understanding on Military
Cooperation was signed between the two countries. Sources told The Indian
Express that following this pact, the services of Duqm port and dry dock will
be available for maintenance of Indian military vessels.

The Port of Duqm is situated on the southeastern seaboard of Oman, overlooking
the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. It is strategically located, in close
proximity to the Chabahar port in Iran. With the Assumption Island being
developed in Seychelles and Agalega in Mauritius, Duqm fits into India’s
proactive maritime security roadmap.

Recently, Duqm has seen a rise in Indian activities. In September last year,
India deployed an attack submarine to this port in the western Arabian Sea. A
Shishumar-class submarine entered Duqm along with naval ship INS Mumbai and
two P-8I long-range maritime

India gets access to strategic Oman port for military use, reconnaissance
aircraft. The naval units were on a month-long deployment with the aim of
enhancing surveillance and cooperation.

Following Modi’s visit to Oman, the joint statement said the two sides noted
that the MoU on Military Cooperation, signed in 2005 and renewed in 2016, has
provided the general framework to strengthen bilateral defence ties. India and
Oman noted that the MoUs on cooperation in maritime security and between Coast
Guards of the two countries, signed in May 2016, have provided a firm
foundation for deepening institutional interactions. “Both sides expressed
satisfaction at the signing of an annexure to the existing MoU on Military
Cooperation between the defence ministries,” it said.

In August 2017, Oman signed an MoU with the United Kingdom that allowed the
Royal Navy to use the Port of Duqm. The agreement allows UK access to
facilities at Duqm, and among the vessels that will be allowed to dock at the
port is the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, the largest ship in the
British Navy.

The joint statement said the Indian side thanked Oman for facilitating
operational visits by Indian Naval ships and aircraft as well as Indian Air
Force aircraft to various ports and airports. “Recognising their common
responsibility towards promoting regional peace and security, the two sides
underlined the importance of further cementing bilateral strategic engagement,
especially in the areas of security and defence,” it said.

It also said that the two sides expressed satisfaction at the ongoing
bilateral security collaboration in the fields of counter-terrorism,
information-sharing and capacity-building, and the Prime Minister appreciated
the support extended by Omani security agencies on “specific issues of
security concern to India”.

They agreed to provide further impetus to the robust defence relations,
including through regular joint exercises by the three defence forces,
training of Navy, Air and Army officials, as also cooperation in the area of
coastal defence and through participation in defence exhibitions, the
statement said.

The Port of Duqm also has a special economic zone, where about $1.8 billion
investments are being made by some Indian companies. The Adani group had
signed an MoU with Duqm port authorities last year, but no investments have
been made so far.

“The Prime Minister expressed his admiration at the ongoing efforts and plans
the Sultanate of Oman is making to diversify its economy and welcomed the
invitation to Indian companies to invest in various sectors in the special
economic zones of Oman, including SEZs in Duqm, Sohar and Salalah. He offered
India’s partnership and cooperation in areas of priority, such as minerals and
mining, manufacturing, logistics, infrastructure, tourism, agriculture and
fisheries, IT and IT enabled-services, skills development, innovation,” said
the joint statement.

In the context of strategic oil reserves near Duqm, it said the Prime Minister
reiterated India’s invitation to Oman to participate in building strategic oil
reserves in India. “Sultan briefed the Indian Prime Minister on Oman’s own
initiative to create its strategic oil reserves in Ras Markaz near Duqm. The
two sides agreed that there is broad scope for mutual cooperation in building
their strategic oil reserves,” the statement said.

Besides Sultan Qaboos, the Prime Minister met Deputy Prime Minister Sayyid
Fahd bin Mahmoud al-Said, and Deputy Prime Minister for International
Relations and Cooperation Affairs Sayyid Asa’ad bin Tariq Al Said.

He also visited a Shiva temple and the Grand Mosque, besides addressing the
business community, before leaving for Delhi. During his meeting with Modi,
Sultan Qaboos shared his views on turmoil in the region, especially in Yemen.
The Prime Minister thanked him for his efforts in securing the release of
captured priest, Father Tom, from Yemen last year.

“The two sides acknowledged the common threat posed by terrorism to peace and
security and agreed to continue working together bilaterally, regionally and
globally to counter this menace. They reiterated their strong condemnation of
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever committed and by
whomever, and declared that there could be no justification for any act of
terrorism anywhere,” said the joint statement.

The two sides also emphasised the need to “isolate the sponsors and supporters
of terrorism” and agreed that the international community should take urgent
action against all entities which support terrorism and use it as an
instrument of policy.

**Budget 2018: Hope higher tariffs are 'temporary phenomenon', says Rajiv Kumar** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Niti Aayog vice-chairman

Rajiv Kumar

said on Monday that he ""hoped"" that higher tariffs in the Budget were a
""temporary phenomenon"". ""I hope this is a temporary phenomenon,"" Kumar said at
a discussion on the Budget at the

Vivekananda International Foundation

.

""

Make in India

has not been as successful as we had thought and therefore the Budget has
taken the route of greater import tariffs to give manufacturing a targeted
approach like we did in the case of Maruti (Suzuki)."" At the same event, two
members of the

Economic Advisory Council

to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) expressed concern about various elements of the
Budget.

Kumar also urged members of EAC-PM to inform Prime Minister Narendra Modi
about their worries about the Budget. ""I hope the EAC-PM is sending a memo to
PM on the wrong choices made in this year's Budget as two of its four members
are saying so,"" he said, adding that the council is expected to highlight such
issues.

EAC-PM member

Surjit Bhalla

voiced concern about the imposition of long-term capital gains tax on stocks
in the Budget while another member Rathin Roy said the country's credibility
has been impacted because

fiscal deficit

reduction commitments had not been met.

""Reintroduction of the long-term capital gains tax is the most absurd policy
initiative of the government without any justification,"" Bhalla said, adding
that this will not fetch the government any more than Rs 5,000 crore against
the budgeted Rs 20,000 crore. He also said that the country is back on the
path of protectionism through increase in custom duties without any clarity on
how much revenue this will generate.

Finance minister

Arun Jaitley

had raised custom duty on imported juices, vegetable oils, furniture,
smartwatches, auto components and imported phones among other items in his
February 1Budget, as the government felt there was substantial potential for
domestic value addition in these sectors. Long-term capital gains tax was
imposed on stocks to ensure parity among asset classes.

The comments follow former Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya's
article in ET on Monday in which he had said a ""new generation of bureaucrats""
is on ""course to erect the wall of protection all over again"". His successor
said that he doesn't see a return to the days of the licence-permit raj.

""I doubt there is a creeping reversal of the 70s when we had import tariffs...
Want to be assured to myself this (is) not (the) beginning of a new
phenomenon,"" said Kumar. The Niti Aayog, a government think tank and premier
policy making body, is chaired by the prime minister.

Jaitley had said in his Budget speech that the move on tariffs was meant ""to
further incentivise the domestic value addition and Make in India in some such
sectors"", which in turn would ""promote creation of more jobs in the country"".

At the

World Economic Forum

in Davos, PM Modi had championed global trade.

""Many countries are becoming inward focused and globalisation is shrinking and
such tendencies can't be considered lesser risk than terrorism or climate
change,"" he had said in comments that were seen as being in contrast with the
protectionist stance of the US administration.

**HIGH INTEREST RATES**

Kumar said the more critical issue in the country was high interest rates and
argued that there was scope to lower them, adding that they don't make sense
given the level of external debt, which is 18% of GDP. ""There is enough scope
to bring it down,"" he said.

The Reserve Bank of India kept rates unchanged last week as it warned about
inflation accelerating. Incidentally, January's retail inflation eased to
5.07% from 5.21% in December, according to data released on Monday.

Rathin Roy said the country is heading for a fiscal crisis in the next 10
years if remedial action wasn't taken. Dividend payouts from the RBI and
state-run units weren't high enough and the lack of coordination among
stakeholders had led to a significant dip in non-tax revenue despite the
disinvestment target for the year having been exceeded.

""Our credibility has been impacted because of our inability to meet our
commitments,"" Roy said. Jaitley said in his Budget speech that the
government's fiscal deficit will be 3.5% this year, compared with the targeted
3.2%. It pegged the fiscal deficit at 3.3% for FY19 versus the earlier pledge
of 3%.

Kumar said long-term capital gains tax had been imposed to bring household
savings back into the real estate sector, which had been hit by
demonetisation, as well as to ensure that any bubble in the surging stock
markets did not burst and hurt the middle class.

Kumar said the Niti Aayog has developed an outcome-based performance framework
for each of the 740 budget lines, which will be a game changer going forward.

**Civilian construction near Army camps a problem: Nirmala Sitharaman** 

 ______ 
JAMMU: Defence Minister

Nirmala Sitharaman

has said that the construction of civilian houses adjacent to Army camps ""with
permission"" from authorities is a problem.

""Civil constructions are taking place near the boundary walls (of Army camps
across the country) and it is getting difficult to remove these constructions
because these are taking place with permission,"" she told reporters yesterday.

""I am studying the scenario in the entire country and will definitely come out
with a solution.""

Sitharaman was in Jammu yesterday to visit the people injured in Saturday's
attack on an Army camp in Sunjuwan by Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists based
across the border.

Six people, including five soldiers, were killed in the attack. Three
militants were also killed in Army retaliation.

The defence minister's visit to Jammu came as an ecounter ensued between
security forces and terrorists near a

CRPF

camp in Srinagar's Karan Nagar area. A CRPF jawan was killed and a policeman
was injured in the exchange of fire yesterday. The CRPF has claimed it
thwarted the attempt by the terrorists to attack its camp there.

Sitharaman blamed

Pakistan

for the terrorist attack on Sunjuwan camp and said Islamabad will pay the
price for the ""misadventure"". She said even though the evidence of Pakistan's
role in the attack may be shared, India reserved the ""right to respond
adequately at the time our choosing"".

Asked about her stand on

Jammu and Kashmir

government's amnesty for stone-pelters, she said, ""I think first-time
offenders were given amnesty and I am aware of that"".

On filing of an FIR against an Army major over the killing of three civilians
in Shopian last month, she said the case is ""sub-judice"" and today the Supreme
Court in response to the father of the officer has given a stay of 15 days on
the FIR.

""We have to see how it goes and we stand by our proud soldiers. In the call of
duty if they have performed something, (it) still has to be contextualised and
that is something on which I understand. I am not sure yet, but subject to
verification, the defence ministry will respond to the Supreme Court,"" she
said.

Sitharaman assured full support to the Army and said, ""The ministry of
defence, me as the defence minister, and the Government of India under Prime
Minister

Narendra Modi

's leadership will not let anybody down.""

""The Army is working under severe duress and we are conscious about it,"" she
said.

**RSS' Hamletian dilemma in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha polls** 

 ______ 
The recent conciliatory missive sent by stormy petrel of Hindutva and

Vishwa Hindu Parishad

International vice-president

Pravin Togadia

, seeking to smoke the peace pipe with PM

Narendra Modi

after years of personal hostility, is a multi-layered development within the
Sangh Parivar. Responses to this overture will have significant bearing on the
Sangh Parivar's ability to forge a united front during the next parliamentary
polls.

In the recently concluded assembly elections in Gujarat, Togadia consistently
assailed BJP. While he did not back Congress directly, the VHP leader lent
weight to Hardik Patel besides making critical remarks on the state
government's performance, which contributed to challenges the party eventually
overcame to come out victors.

Togadia's message to Modi to ""come together"" and ""work for the nation""
followed bitter power-struggle for several weeks when the Sangh unsuccessfully
attempted to dislodge Togadia from his pivotal position within VHP and the
subsequent high drama when he went 'missing' only to surface a day later
alleging a plot to kill him in a false encounter. Indications of a backroom
settlement being hammered out was evident when Vijay Rupani's government
dropped charges in a two-decade old attempt-to-murder case against Togadia.

However, Togadia sought to extract a 'price' for undoubted compromise with his
personal ego that made him swallow conceit. The cost Togadia 'levied' on Modi
is a clever subterfuge aimed at trapping Modi in committing on issues over
which he would want complete freedom. Togadia's words of conciliation are
suffixed with ""matters of concern"" that the PM would want no reminding:
unemployment of youth, rural 'distress', state of SSIs and ""health of the
nation"". Moreover, Togadia continues making critical statements raising doubts
over his sincerity.

Additionally, the VHP leader flagged 'promises' that can be delivered in the
event of rapprochement between the two. Modi would not take kindly to
'reminders' served by Togadia - tackling escalating cost of education, law to
facilitate construction of Ram temple in

Ayodhya

, a cow protection law and rehabilitation of Hindus in Kashmir. Modi is
unlikely to ever put these issues on the 'negative list', but he would want
complete liberty to decide on strategy to calibrate advancement towards these
goals and not allow anyone to take credit.

Besides personal rivalry dating back to more than two decades, divergences
between Togadia and Modi mirror the gap between BJP and

RSS

affiliates like Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and

Bharatiya Kisan Sangh

. Each of these follow sector-specific charters and take little note of
compulsions of governance, which restricts elbow room for BJP leaders.

VHP, for instance, is launching another edition of Ram Rath Yatra from Ayodhya
on February 13 and would want Ram temple construction to start straight away.
Likewise, other affiliates active on economic, labour and peasantry fronts
gfrustrated when the BJP government moderates the stance adopted during
agitations when in opposition. The dichotomy between realpolitik and
ideological and programmatic idealism is normally balanced between BJP and
Sangh affiliates by the RSS leadership and failure to do this cost the party
dearly in 2004 and nearly did in Gujarat.

Despite relations between Modi and the Mohan Bhagwat-led RSS being healthier
than ever before, there are instances when government has faced tough
situations. Affiliates argue aggressive posture is necessary to retaining
pivotal position in competitive sectors. BMS, it is argued, will lose cadre if
they do not take up workers' issues wherever necessary.

This poses a Hamletian dilemma for the Sangh Parivar. If affiliates weaken,
the famed RSS network will be unable to turn out for BJP in polls. But if
affiliates get freehand to outrun rivals, government and ruling party get
destabilised. Indisputably, internal cohesion is lacking and the Sangh
leadership has failed to limit areas where affiliates must remain engaged. For
instance, in a liberalised world, there is a need to rethink relevance and
thrust of SJM. Likewise, the RSS must decide the extent to which VHP remains
unifocal on the temple.

Failure of the Sangh leadership to either find ways to accommodate Togadia and
his likes in other affiliates or marginalise them completely will queer BJP's
pitch in the run-up the next polls. RSS has coped with similar conflicts in
the past, but matters were ironed out by timely intervention from fatherly
figures. The present crop in RSS and BJP are contemporaries and those formally
anointed Margdarshaks have either paid scant respect or have not lived up to
expectations.

**Why Modi govt should worry about RSS’ ability to mobilise** 

 ______ 
Written by

Updated: February 13, 2018 11:09 am

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. (Source: Pradip Das)

Those who are criticising the RSS chief for ‘insulting’ the Indian Army by
saying that Sangh volunteers can mobilise faster are both wrong and miss the
point. In his speech at Muzaffarpur, Mohan Bhagwat stated with visible pride
that Sangh volunteers are so disciplined that they can be mobilised in a
matter of days, should the Constitution and the laws of the country so demand.
This is not an insult to the Indian Army.

What is of greater importance to the Indian republic is why the RSS should be
mobilising a fighting force. No state can survive if it does not command a
monopoly over the legitimate use of violence inside and outside the country.
In fact, the question of the Constitution or laws calling upon the RSS to
fight does not arise at all. Between the armed forces, territorial army,
central paramilitary forces, reserve police, home guards and NCC, India can
muster several million troops that are more than adequate to address any
internal or external threat. And large numbers of them can be mobilised within
days.

There is little doubt that most RSS activists and volunteers are motivated by
intense patriotism and Hindu nationalism. Even so, it is wrong and deeply
worrisome to suggest that its volunteers have any role to play in national
defence or internal security. The Republic of India does not and must not
outsource its fundamental responsibilities to political organisations.

I often receive criticism for supporting the RSS’ right to exist and carry out
its political, cultural and religious activities. You don’t need to agree with
its ideology or political agenda to support its right to promote them in every
legitimate way. People often point to the RSS’ work in delivering humanitarian
relief, promoting education and pro-India sentiments in many places to argue
in its support. Even if it didn’t engage in such community service, the RSS
has and should have the right to peacefully pursue its ideological and
political agenda.

What it should not have is the capacity to compete with the organs of the
Indian state when it comes to the use of force. That’s why Mr Bhagwat’s
comments are worrisome, regardless of his disclaimers that the RSS is not a
military or paramilitary organisation, but a family organisation with a
disciplined force of volunteers. The capacity to mobilise large numbers of
people should concern the government. The capacity to do so faster than the
government’s own forces should concern the government even more.

It’s not only the RSS. There are a large number of organisations in India
today that, to varying degrees, have the characteristics of militia groups.
Few are as disciplined as the RSS. Some of them even call themselves “senas”.
Many are involved in agitations, riots and political mobilisation during
elections. They provide violent capacity to politicians and parties. Others
act on behalf of caste groups, ethnic communities or religious organisations.
Their operations are increasingly brazen, as when the organised activists of
Dera Sacha Sauda held Chandigarh and many parts of Haryana to ransom last
year. It cannot be anyone’s argument that their proliferation is a good thing.

On the contrary, the growth and strengthening of organisations that look,
sound and act like militias is a serious risk to India’s national security.
With a burgeoning population of young men, inadequate job creation and spread
of social media, we have all the ingredients of a rise in violence in the
country that will challenge the rule of law because it is also so enmeshed
with politics. There is an urgent need to regulate the organisations that have
the characteristics of a militia, regardless of their self-description.

We need only to look to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for inspiration on how to
tackle this threat. He would combine his faith in a plural democracy with his
resolute commitment to the enforcement of the writ of the state. We need a new
law to regulate militias, and bring them under a regulatory framework. For
instance, once an organisation is deemed to have the capacity for organised
violence, it should be required to post bank guarantees consistent with its
record of violence, maintain registers of all members, declare their criminal
records, submit to regular police inspections and get itself audited. It is
possible to balance their right of association with the public interest of
maintaining law and order.

We need a public debate on the role of organised political violence in India.
Every one of India’s neighbours has paid the price for the folly of
tolerating, promoting or surrendering to groups that use violence. We should
learn the right lessons from their mistakes.

**PM Modi's '56-Inch Chest' Nothing But Hollow Claim: Ghulam Nabi Azad** 

 ______ 
**Varanasi: **

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad today hit out at the government over
the recent terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and, in a swipe at Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, said his ""56-inch chest"" was nothing but a ""hollow
claim"".

Mr Azad also said that the Modi government was the weakest in 70 years.

Addressing Congress workers in Varanasi, Mr Azad claimed that so many terror
attacks never happened in Jammu and Kashmir under the previous governments.

Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Modi, Azad said his ""56 -inch chest"" was
nothing but a ""hollow claim"" ('

_kaaghazi seena hai_

').

He said attacks were on the rise under the rule of the present PDP-BJP
government in Jammu and Kashmir.

Mr Azad said if the central government is weak then terrorist attacks on the
Army will continue.

Five Army men, including two junior commissioned officers (JCOs), and the
father of a soldier were killed by the terrorists who struck at the sprawling
camp of the 36 Brigade of the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JKLI) in Jammu
on Saturday.

The Army said on Sunday that three heavily armed terrorists were also killed
in the encounter.

Lashing out at the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government, Mr Azad said
the Dalits, minorities and women were unsafe in the state.

He said unemployment and inflation has peaked under the Modi government.

The government failed to fulfil the promise made to the farmers and the youth
of this country, he said.

The senior Congress leader along with state Congress chief Raj Babbar
addressed the Congress workers of the eastern region here.

**BJP Calls Congress ""B-Grade Video Production House"" After ""Misogyny"" Video** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

Close on the heels of a row over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remark
triggered by Renuka Chowdhury's laughter in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress
posted a video on Monday accusing the BJP and its leaders of harbouring a
""misogynistic"" attitude.

""Misogyny runs deep within the BJP and PM Modi's statements are a classic
example of this deplorable mindset,"" read a tweet posted along with a video
with the hashtag ""#MisogynisticModi"" on the Congress Twitter handle.

The video shows Prime Minister Modi's remark in the Rajya Sabha over Ms
Chowdhury's laughter, his reported statement on Sonia Gandhi and his ""50-crore
girlfriend"" remark about Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's wife, Sunanda
Pushkar, as well as RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's remarks terming marriage a
""contract"".

**Here's what the Congress tweeted from their official twitter handle yesterday:**

""How can women of India hope for equality under the leadership of
misogynists,"" the video, which also carried statements of BJP leaders such as
Arun Jaitley and Mahesh Sharma, asked.

The BJP has dubbed it a ""flippant message"" produced by a ""B-grade video
production house"".

""Ever since Rahul Gandhi has taken over as the Congress president, the party
has given up on serious political commentary on important issues and is
functioning as a B-grade video production house with a flippant message. The
party is now operating at the level of Rahul Gandhi's IQ,"" said BJP
spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao.

Last week, Prime Minister Modi had said in Parliament that Renuka Chowdhury's
laughter -- sparked by his remark that Aadhaar was mooted by the NDA --
reminded him of the epic serial, Ramayana.

**Here's what PM Modi requested Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, when Congress' Renuka Chowdhury laughed hysterically in the House while the prime minister was speaking:**

Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had posted a video clip from the TV
serial, showing Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, laughing aloud.

* The rhetoric used to be manifested in the slogans like 'Inquilab Zindabad' and 'Vande Mataram', but this time 'Vande Mataram' has been replaced by ‘Jai Shree Ram’. For Tripurites, Ram has never been a God, rather a mythical figure incorporated into public memory by Ramananda Sagar’s 1990s TV show.

* The BJP has sold itself very well. From the Agartala airport till the city, saffron flags have overshadowed the red ones. Added to that, the RSS-backed party has deployed a galaxy of political stars including BJP president Amit Shah, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Cabinet ministers Nitin Gadkari and Smriti Irani, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to launch a ruthless campaign ahead of the elections.

* When asked about incumbent chief minister Manik Sarkar, they (newly joined RSS people) alleged that even though the CPM leader might be poor and honest he is giving sanctuary to a large number of corrupt people. And once BJP comes to power they will be eliminated from the system. They trust in the party high command and will accept whoever becomes BJP’s chief ministerial candidate.

* The BJP is cashing in on the anti-incumbency factor against CPM. The election is driven neither by policy nor ideology. It is a straight fight for change in one side as evident from BJP’s election slogan-cum-hashtag #CholoPaltai while the other side is desperately trying to retain its losing ground. 

* The BJP election manifesto was called ‘Vision Document 2018’ and was unveiled by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Agartala on Sunday, a week ahead of polling day. The document lists big promises which the party is capable of delivering given its absolute power in Centre and Modi’s Act East mindset.

* The highlighted promises are: giving one employment opportunity to every household; free education for women till graduation, immediate implementation of Seventh Pay Commission for state government employees, free health insurance to all Below Poverty Line (BPL) households and free smartphones for the youth.

* Apart from starting an agriculture university to establishing independent state directorates for tea, rubber, and bamboo, the party has also promised to implement all central schemes around the state with a special focus on starting a venture capital fund to boost agro-based industries.

* The BJP has also promised to fill the 50,000 plus vacant seats in the state government within a year through a transparent process.

* The BJP promises a number of multi-specialty hospitals with at least one AIIMS level high tech hospital in the state. It has further promised to collaborate with the Central government to open up a new RIMS level medical college in Tripura and at least one medical college in the TTAADC area.

* BJP has promised to give free smartphones to the youth under the Digital India drive. This seems like a vague promise at this point.

* Apart from a host of other promises, BJP has said that it will include stories of the Tripura’s dynasty rulers in school syllabus, which, in fact, is already present in the Tripura Board of Secondary Education curriculum.

* Finally, BJP has settled an old controversy and declared to rename the Agartala Airport as Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore International Airport after the king who built it in 1942. Also, the status of an international airport will be a boost to the state’s economy.",2018-02-13 18:07:24

**Alliance inevitable; talks on between Shiv Sena and BJP, says minister**

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra
Fadnavis. (Express Archive)

A senior BJP cabinet minister in Maharashtra on Tuesday said his party and its
bickering ally Shiv Sena will lose the 2019 Assembly polls if they fight
separately, and discussions for alliance are going on. “A Sena leader close to
(Shiv Sena chief) Uddhav Thackeray recently came to my house and we held talks
about alliance. Preserving the alliance is a necessity for both the parties,
because if the Congress and NCP fight together and we fight separately, both
(saffron) parties will lose. If we come together, we will win around 190 seats
(out of 288),” the minister told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

When asked about Thackeray’s assertion that his party will fight all polls in
future on its own, the minister pointed out how the equations changed
dramatically in Bihar. “Nitish Kumar had publicly insulted Prime Minister
Narendra Modi, but later he joined us. It will happen here as well,” he said.
“If a leader like Modi can accept Nitish for the sake of the country, we
(state leaders) are small fry. What ego we should have,” he said.

A large number of people in both the BJP and Sena want the alliance to
continue, he claimed. “There will be so much pressure from people and party
workers that alliance will become inevitable,” he said. When asked for
reaction, a senior Sena leader categorically denied that any such talks are
underway. “It’s just kite-flying,” the leader said.

Uddhav Thackeray had stated last month that his party will have no tie-up with
the BJP in future elections, and accused the latter of trying to upstage the
Sena on its home turf.

of a country’s foreign policy was having a “good relationship” with others.
“Today India is actually isolated in the region,” he told professionals and
business people here during an interaction on the last day of his four-day
‘Janashirvad Yatra’ in the northern region of poll-bound Karnataka.

India should work for creating as many jobs as there are in China, he said,
adding that New Delhi must find a peaceful and not aggressive way to counter
Beijing. “We have to find a way, not an aggressive way, not a military way,
but a peaceful way to compete with the Chinese,” he said.

Gandhi referred to the “massive expansion” of Chinese presence in the region.
“You see the Chinese have a presence in Nepal, they have a presence in
Pakistan, in Sri Lanka, in Maldives… They have a presence in Burma (Myanmar),”
Gandhi added.

He said the NDA government had created a “problem” in India’s foreign policy.
India’s “old friend Russia” was now “cosying up to our neighbours on the
western side”, he said, adding, “This is actually a serious problem which is
not getting discussed.”

Hitting out at the Union government on employment generation, Gandhi claimed
that while China was creating 50,000 jobs in 24 hours, the NDA government was
generating 450 jobs in 24 hours. “The simple thing is, there is only one
measure, not two: how many jobs is India creating and how many jobs is China
creating. I’m sad to say that over the last four years it (job creation) has
become a really serious problem,” he added.

On economic growth, he said India was “doing okay, (but) it was doing much
better before”. The issue of jobs, he said, was not being publicly discussed.
“When it comes to jobs, India is failing completely and this is not something
that is publicly in the discourse at all,” he added.

Gandhi, however, conceded that to an extent even during the Congress-led UPA
rule, “we were nowhere near the number of jobs that needed to be created”. He
also spoke about the “massive increase” in the defence budgets of the U.S.,
China and Russia, and said, “We are now entering a new phase in world politics
where you are going to see increased tension between U.S., China and
Russians.” “In this situation, India has to have a clear understanding of the
path going forward,” he said.

**PM Modi can establish peace between Palestine and Israel: Najma Heptulla** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| New Delhi |

Published: February 13, 2018 8:05 pm

Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be able to establish peace between
Palestine and Israel through mediation as he is a “global leader” that both
sides trust, Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla said today.

Terming Modi’s visit to Palestine last week as crucial, Heptulla said that she
herself was involved with the issue (conflict between Palestine-Israel) for
around 40 years and on the basis of her experience she could say that Modi can
establish peace between the two nations.

“I don’t know when and how, but I feel with the faith that the people of
Palestine and Israel have in Modi, the prime minister will act a mediator and
be able to bring a solution to the crisis between the two nations,” Heptulla
told reporters during a press conference here.

Modi being honoured with the “Grand Collar of the State of Palestine,”, the
highest honour given to foreign dignitaries by the country, during his visit
to Palestine signified the trust the people of the country had in him,
Heptulla said. “The respect he received in Palestine shows that he is accepted
as a world leader,” she said.

The Manipur governor, who is visiting Delhi, also met Union Home minister
Rajnath Singh. She apprised Singh of the “improved” law and order situation in
Manipur and discussed ways to resolve the drug abuse problem prevalent in the
region.

Heptulla also mentioned a proposal of the Home ministry of issuing
certificates or visas to monitor and restrict the movement in the border areas
to curb drug and arms smuggling. “Home Minister has come up with a good
initiative as part of which certificates/visa will be given for 15 days so
that people of India can go to Myanmar freely and natives from Myanmar can
come to India through the border freely and vice versa. “It will put a check
on the illegal movement and a record can be maintained that can help curb the
drugs, arms and ammunition smuggling,” she said.

Heptulla said that the law and order situation in Manipur has improved over
the past few months as markets remain open even after 7PM, extortion cases
have stopped and elections have been held peacefully.

Heptulla also said that she wants to promote tourism in Manipur and poor
connectivity was a major barrier in achieving that goal. She called for the
introduction of direct flights. Heptulla said she had requested the Ministry
of Civil Aviation for introducing a direct flight from Delhi to Imphal after
which Air India introduced one such flight.

**Three years into power, Arvind Kejriwal is now a quieter politician** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

Delhi

Chief Minister

Arvind Kejriwal

, whose government completes three years in office on Wednesday, is now a
quieter person vis-a-vis targeting his bitter political rival -- Prime
Minister

Narendra Modi

.

Kejriwal, with 13 million followers on

Twitter

, has not tweeted the word ""Modi"" even once in the past 11 months. His last
tweet mentioning Modi was on March 9, 2017. In 2016, he had mentioned ""Modi""
124 times in his tweets and 33 times in 2017 -- mostly attacking the Prime
Minister.

Party leaders and political analysts say the change from tweeting ""Modi
declares emergency in Delhi"", ""dictatorial Modi govt"" and ""Isn't Modi govt
anti-army"" to stopping all mention of Modi's name follows

AAP

's election losses -- first in Punjab and Goa and then in Delhi civic polls
and a by-election from Rajouri Garden in 2017.

Also, the AAP chief has never tagged Modi (@narendramodi) in any of his tweets
in 2017 and 2018 so far. In 2016, he tagged the Prime Minister eight times.

Kejriwal even refrained from personally attacking the Prime Minister when
tempers between the central government and Delhi government ran high over
disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs in January this year. The AAP said its
lawmakers were disqualified at the behest of the BJP government at the Centre.

Party leaders and some political analysts IANS spoke with said it was more of
a strategy than an accidental quietude.

A senior party leader said the ""conscious decision"" was taken in a meeting
that Kejriwal convened after last year's debacle in Delhi civic polls in which
the AAP emerged a distant second with 48 seats after the BJP swept the polls
by winning 181 seats.

It was a big blow for the AAP that swept the Delhi elections in 2015 by
winning 67 out of 70 Assembly seats.

""It (attacking Modi) was not taking us anywhere and we decided to rather focus
on governance,"" the AAP leader said.

Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury agreed that it ""was a definite change in
(Kejriwal's) strategy"" to stop attacking Modi personally. ""It is evident that
the AAP has lost the trust of the middle class and they need to win back the
trust if they have to keep Delhi.""

Praveen Rai, another political analyst with the Centre for Study of Developing
Societies (CSDS), said: ""We have been seeing a much, much more sober Kejriwal.
He is growing as a leader and is becoming a seasoned politician. But he has a
long way to go.""

AAP Chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj attributed the shift to ""a good
communication system (that) keeps reinventing itself"" and the party follows
that idea.

""Initially people wanted to know why works in Delhi were not being done and we
had to explain to them in the first two years. Now people understand that LG
is not allowing many works and files go through him,"" Bharadwaj said.

He said the strategy of attacking Modi and the central government ""served its
purpose"" and there was no need to repeat it.

If another series of large scale riots break out, then the list will only increase but that is the normal state of affairs in India.

Maulana Nadvi's recent meeting with Sri Sri, and his departure from official board stand was bound to come up in AIMPLB's session. And, as hearing is about to start is court, so media are going to discuss this issue more prominently. Zafar Agha may be a senior journalist, but if he believes that Modi's victory was a one time wonder and Congress can turn it around in the next elections completely only if muslims remain mum, then he needs to have a rethink. The changes which are happening in the India society over the past few years go much deeper and cannot be easily rolled back by running a slick social campaign and a better election campaign.

There is a well thought of campaign in the media to discredit AIMPLB to make it as if they are the root cause of every problem in Hindustan. Bhupendra Chaubey Sahab also has a problem. Who is he? He wants muslims to disown the board, come out of self-imposed ghettoisation and all these issues would be solved - Viola! And, you can find many other people espousing the same viewpoint. The organisation may have it's faults, but it is no worse than others who claim to have solution to the problems. On Ayodhya issue itself, Sunni Waqf board in UP is party to the main case of title deed. It's not AIMPLB, which doesn't have any say from a legal perspective. One can disown the board tomorrow, but who else is there to speak up for muslim social and religious issues. RSS? BJP?

In this instant, the discussion is NOT about them unless certain muslims (read the AIMPLB) choose to make it so. Politically the smart thing to do is to not be provoked. When the issue is in court, why take the bait? Especially when we know that Modi has a good grasp on the media through his corporate buddies, and they will twist every word to suit the *Sangh's* agenda. 

&gt; ... Hindu consolidation for Modi happened even without Ram Mandir issue in 2014.

There is no such ""Hindu"" consolidation - Modi won 2014 because the people were really repulsed by the scam tainted Congress. Now that people have realised that Modi was a bigger scam on them, they'll go back to voting for non-BJP parties. 

&gt; If another series of large scale riots break out, then the list will only increase but that is the normal state of affairs in India.

No, it is not.

&gt; ... only if muslims remain mum ..

Forget the Congress, but in this particular context he is right. If the *Jihadis* and the *Sanghis* slug it out, the losers will be the ordinary Muslims and the Hindus. And yes, in a communaly polarised situation it is always the BJP that benefits.

&gt; There is a well thought of campaign in the media to discredit AIMPLB to make it as if they are the root cause of every problem in Hindustan.

This is not one of them.

**Can the Congress stage a comeback in 2019 elections?** 

 ______ 
The Congress is in uncharted waters, with a new captain leading the ship. It
remains to be seen if Rahul Gandhi can help his party tide over the rough
waters. Photo: PTI

In 2013, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said that if India was a computer,
then the Congress was its default program. The statement was widely panned for
betraying the feudal mindset of the Congress. But truth be told, he wasn’t far
off the mark. Until 2013, the Congress had lost national power just three
times: 1977, 1989 and 1996. On two of those occasions, it maintained a very
healthy vote share of 39.5% (1989) and 34.5% (1977). A non-Congress government
completed its first full term only in 2004—a full 57 years after independence.
And no non-Congress government has ever completed two consecutive full terms
yet.

What the Narendra Modi government will be hoping to achieve in 2019 elections
is thus unprecedented. In 2004, nobody gave any chance to the Congress: the
party was, like today, at its lowest-ever ebb of 114 seats and a popular prime
minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee was seeking re-election. Yet the Congress
bounced back, upstaging the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in a close fight in
2004 and widening the margin in 2009. Can the grand old party of India take
heart from 2004 and stage a strong comeback in 2019?

To answer this, one needs to study the performance of the Congress in two
periods: a) 1952-84 and b) 1989-2014. The first period was definitely the era
of the Congress being the default operating system of Indian politics. Even
though its vote share fluctuated between a low of 34.5% (1977) and a high of
48.1% (1984), the trend line was always above 40%. But the second period saw a
steep decline, both in terms of vote share and seat share.

2004 was not the best comeback performance of the Congress. In 1980, it had
increased its vote share by 8.2 percentage points, and managed to boost its
seat tally by 199. But that was because the Janata Party, the Congress’s
primary rival, had disintegrated completely between 1977 and 1980. It is
highly unlikely that the Congress will receive such a windfall in 2019. The
better indicators are the Lok Sabha elections in 1971, 1984 and 2009, when the
Congress increased its seats tally by 69, 62 and 61 seats, respectively. An
increase of approximately 70 seats in 2019 will merely help reduce the margin
of BJP victory.

Four points need to be kept in mind while assessing the chances of a strong
Congress revival in 2019 elections. One, for the first time in post-
independence history, the national vote share of the Congress has fallen below
20%. During the period of its dominance (1952-84), its vote share never fell
below 34%. Even between 1984 and 2009, its vote share never fell below 25%.
The Congress is in uncharted waters, with a new captain leading the ship. Can
Rahul Gandhi help his party tide over the rough waters?

Two, the BJP now has more state legislators than the Congress. It is quite
possible that the default operating system of Indian politics has changed. If
so, will the Congress now come to power only episodically, just like its
rivals did in the first few decades after independence?

Three, the Congress’s best comebacks (except in 1980) haven’t crossed 70
seats. But since it is operating from a very low base, it should, and can, aim
for a jump of something like 100 seats.

Four, another challenge for the Congress will be to get the opposition
together to fight the BJP. If the example of the Bihar elections (2015) is
anything to go by, the arithmetic of a united opposition can create trouble
for Modi’s re-election bid. But the inability to craft a similar opposition
alliance in Uttar Pradesh (2017), Nitish Kumar’s defection to the BJP-led
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the decision of the Communist Party of
India (Marxist), or CPM, not to enter into an alliance with the Congress for
the 2019 elections, mean that the BJP is less worried than it could have been.

The BJP will find it extremely difficult to repeat its 2014 performance in
states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The gains
from states in the North-East and those like West Bengal and Odisha may not be
enough to bridge the deficit in the north and the west. It will bank upon a
divided opposition cannibalizing itself to not fall much below its 2014 tally
of 282 seats.

**A loss in Karnataka for the BJP will certainly add impetus to the already widespread speculation about the prospects of an early Lok Sabha election**

The BJP’s biggest fear will be that losing power in even two of the three
major states—Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh—going to polls this year
will create momentum in favour of the Congress. A loss in Karnataka for the
BJP will certainly add impetus to the already widespread speculation about the
prospects of an early Lok Sabha election. Then, there are already murmurs that
a poor showing by the BJP may lead it to choose a prime minister other than
Modi to attract the required number of coalition partners.

The Congress will have to change the definition of victory in the 2019
elections. If it manages to restrict the BJP to a number (200 or less) where
the latter cannot form a government or can form a government only with a
different prime minister, Gandhi would have something to celebrate. His may no
longer be the default operating system of Indian politics, but he can
justifiably claim that even the BJP is not there yet.

**Ashok Gehlot: Rahul must be at helm of anti-BJP alliance, Congress won’t accept anyone else** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: With Hardik Patel’s endorsement of

Trinamool Congress

chief

Mamata Banerjee

further stoking the wrangling over who should lead the opposition in

Lok Sabha

elections,

Congress

general secretary

Ashok Gehlot

told Subodh Ghildiyal no other leader other than

Rahul Gandhi

can helm the anti-BJP axis.

** Q› Who will lead the opposition camp in 2019 Lok Sabha elections?   
**

Rahul Gandhi. Congress is a national party, with presence in every village.
The countrymen expect Congress to provide the leadership. While our workers
will always say so, even people want it.

** Q› PAAS chief Hardik Patel has said Trinamool Congress’s Mamata Banerjee should lead the opposition?   
**

I don’t know what he said and in what context. So, I don’t want to comment on
it. Rahul Gandhi is the Congress president and people want the leadership to
be with a national party. Without that, our party will get stuck. If the
Congress rank and file feels they have no role in the leadership of the
country, why will they work? So, even the Congress brass cannot afford to
consider such a thought (of conceding the leadership to another party). Even
if Congress wants to show magnanimity, how can it if its worker is not ready?

** Q› It was assumed that BJP, with an aggressive Hindutva agenda, will force the opposition together. That expectation has been belied?   
**

This is the proper time.

Sonia Gandhi

has taken the timely initiative to bring together the opposition, like she had
done in 2002.

** Q› While Rahul has become the Congress chief, do you think he has gained acceptability among the opposition parties?   
**

He just assumed the charge of Congress two months ago. When there is greater
interaction with the opposition, I am sure he will become the leader. I am
sure the opposition will show wisdom and, given the kind of government
Narendra Modi is running, it will realise that leadership should be with
Congress under Rahul Gandhi.

** Q› But do you think the opposition will ultimately come on one platform?   
**

No party likes the present situation in the country — of violence, hatred,
insensitivity and an atmosphere of fear. Even NDA partners do not like it.
Allies may leave the BJP closer to elections. Even BJP leaders resent that
just Amit Shah and Narendra Modi are ruling the country.

** Q› What will be an effective campaign against BJP in elections?   
**

Despite the BJP getting a full majority, Modi has neither fulfilled his
promises nor implemented his plans. Every section of the country is angry. So,
how will this government return to power? Farmers, youth and women are
disappointed. Modi just has his oratory. But oratory does not give you food or
jobs or remunerative crop prices. We will put forth our agenda as delivered by
Manmohan Singh government. We provided employment, brought in Food Security
Act for the poor, enacted RTI for transparency. BJP just gave a slogan of
bringing back black money and controlling inflation but has done nothing.

** Q› How do you see it playing out in the elections?   
**

Modi’s thoughts about a party, which fought for independence and faced
brutality at the hands of the British, will sink him. He has no right to talk
about Gandhi or Patel. He has no commitment to them but is only using their
names to garner votes.

**Eyes on 2019 polls, government plans over 60 media units to expand outreach** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The information and broadcasting ministry plans to set up more than
60 media units across the country that are expected to strengthen the Modi
government’s outreach to smaller cities and rural areas in the run-up to the
2019 general election.

This is the first time the ministry is planning to set up media units beyond
the capital cities, officials said, pointing to Bhuj, Rohtak, Siliguri, Kochi,
Korba and Muzaffarnagar, among other places, which they said minister

Smriti Irani

has identified for strengthening the government’s communication machinery.

The new media units are likely to become operational in the next few months,
well in time for the next general election, said one of the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

These units are expected to run a structured eight-month campaign to highlight
the Modi government’s achievements, the official said, such as its efforts to
fine-tune the goods and services tax or GST regime, tackle non-performing
assets of banks, quicken the pace of electrification, complete infrastructure
projects, weed out corruption in high places and ensure direct benefit
transfer of subsidies.

Irani has spoken to

Uttar Pradesh

chief minister

Yogi Adityanath

and Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das, among others, to allot space for the proposed
media units, officials said.

In UP alone, seven media units are likely to come up, in places including
Bareilly, Moradabad, Aligarh, Agra, Muzaffarnagar and the PM’s constituency,
Varanasi, besides state capital Lucknow. States including Tamil Nadu,
Maharashtra, Rajasthan, MP, Bihar and Karnataka will have two centres each for
the Centre’s media units, as per the plan, while nine centres will come up in
states in the Northeast.

The I&amp;amp;B ministry has already allocated funds to make the proposed media
units operational, officials said. In each of the new media units, they said,
there will be an electronic media monitoring centre which will look at the
content in local newspapers and TV channels and send updates to the head
office in Delhi.

The ministry also plans to set up a social media communication hub in every
state across the country that will report local events to ministry officials.

Seven senior officers of director general level will be stationed in
Chandigarh, Lucknow, Kolkata, Bhopal, Mumbai, Chennai and Imphal to monitor
flow of information in their respective zones, as per the plan.

The emphasis will be on flow of communication in regional languages, which
will now include, apart from Hindi and Urdu in northern states, Dogri,
Garhwali, Santhali, Bhojpuri, Maithali and Konkani, officials said.

Seven senior officers who were handling media-related work in the capital for
ministries have been chosen to head the new media units and oversee
dissemination of the government's communication to the remotest areas. This is
in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mandate to “not just have
governance in place but also keep the citizens informed about its policies”,
the official cited earlier said.

Several other officials posted in the capital and existing media units of the
government in other cities have been transferred to other parts of the country
in the past two months. The I&amp;amp;B ministry saw the transfer of 20 IIS
(Indian Information Service) officers last month, after two dozen officers
were transferred in the previous month, and many more are expected to be
relocated in the coming days.

Irani wants to break the “stagnancy” in media units across the country,
another official said, although the main purpose behind the transfers is said
to be the merging of several existing departments of the media units to
“streamline and disseminate information”.

“The minister has noticed that fresh energy needs to be infused into these
units so that existing cliques of people working against the government or
stalling communication can be checked,” the official said. “A fresh map was
drawn where she identified the places that need stronger communication in the
coming days and then selected people accordingly to handle the new tasks.”

Under the new system, according to the plan put together by Irani and I&amp;amp;B
secretary NK Sinha, the Press Information Bureau will not only handle all
issues of communication but also those related to the Registrar of Newspapers
for India, Cable Television Network and the monitoring by Electronic Media
Monitoring Centres. The Directorate of Field Publicity will also handle issues
related to the Directorate of Advertising and Publicity and the Publications
Division. “Heads of newspapers will no longer have to travel to Delhi to get
their issues sorted. They can go to the district offices,” an official said.

I&amp;amp;B ministry officials have dismissed complaints of a section of IIS
officers who alleged that transfers were taking place without any consultation
and that some senior officers were transferred to stations where the posts
allotted to them did not exist or that multiple officers were assigned the
same role.

Officials said five meetings were held with officers involved in government
communication to know their location preferences. Irani was keen that
government officials who have been posted in the Northeast or other far-flung
areas also get a choice of location, a person aware of the matter said.

“Some people don’t want to leave Delhi while several others have never been
posted in cities. The minister felt that should end. At least five cases where
the person was close to retirement or cases where the officer was unwell or
had a child with dyslexia were looked at and the transfers were stopped,” the
person said on condition of anonymity.

Suitability has been the key governing principle behind the transfers, the
person said. “If a certain officer has had years of experience working in the
RAW and home ministry, he was seen as most suited to handle the North-eastern
states where internal security is a grave concern. In another case, an officer
from Election Commission has also been asked to handle finance as he already
had experience in the area in his earlier years,” he said.

**State to buy 1.5 lakh books on PM Modi for schools, Congress alleges ‘agenda’** 

 ______ 
By:

Express News Service

| Pune |

Published: February 14, 2018 6:03 am

THE CONGRESS alleged on Tuesday that the BJP-led state government’s decision
of purchasing 1.5 lakh books about Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its
schools was an “agenda to promote the BJP among schoolchildren”.

“The state government should clarify under which category — mythological,
religious and historical — were the books on Prime Minister being purchased
for the schools run by the state government. If they were being purchased
under the mythological category, we have never read the name of a Prime
Minister in mythological books; if bought under historical category, then the
Prime Minister is not related to the freedom struggle. This means that the
only purpose of purchasing the books on Prime Minister is to promote BJP among
schoolchildren,” Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, leader of opposition in the state
Legislative Assembly, said during a press conference on Tuesday.

He added that, as compared to the lakhs of books being purchased about the
Prime Minister, the state government has significantly reduced the number of
books it is going to buy on Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr B R
Ambedkar The Opposition leader added that books worth Rs 20 were purchased for
Rs 50, the total expenditure of which would be about Rs 8.17 crore, from
Bhartiya Vichar Sadhane — RSS-linked publishing house.

“The BJP-led government has favoured the publishing house by paying more
amount than required. The content of the books is beyond the understanding of
schoolchildren,” he added.

All this matters little there is no opposition. And the image of Congress amongst the middle class (and remember the dem0graphics of this middle class if very different from 2004) is very poor.

People think oh if they put in Shashi Tharoor people will vote. Ha no. Tharoor in no way relates to the middle class. Just because buzzfeed and people on social media are enamoured by his rote verbosity it does not mean that will translate into votes. His entire persona is built around a being a brown Englishman, why would the middle class vote for him? The 1% might but the rest of us?

This will become plainly obvious as Karnataka elections comes up.

For the middle class the narratives of Congress are inherently neo-coloniaist ideals. Modi when he attacks Nehru knows exactly what he is doing. Indians don't relate with secularism, liberalism and thats the truth that people don't want to hear.

**Punjab National Bank detects $1.77 billion worth of fraudulent transactions** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: Indian state-run

Punjab National Bank

said on Wednesday it had detected some ""fraudulent and unauthorised""
transactions worth about $1.77 billion at one of its branches in

Mumbai

.

The bank said in a regulatory filing the transactions were ""for the benefit of
a few select account holders with their apparent connivance"" and that ""based
on these transactions other banks appear to have advanced money to these
customers abroad.""

PNB

, the country's second-biggest state-run lender and fourth-biggest overall by
assets, did not name the people involved but said it had reported the deals to
law enforcement agencies and would evaluate later whether it faces any
liability arising out of the transactions.

""In the bank these transactions are contingent in nature and liability arising
out of these on the bank shall be decided based on the law and genuineness of
underlying transactions,"" PNB said, without giving further details.

PNB

shares

were trading 4.1 percent lower by 0420 GMT, having fallen as much as 5.7
percent in early trading. The main Mumbai market index was little changed.

PNB is already dealing with other allegations of fraudulent transactions. Last
week, Indian federal agents said they had launched an investigation into
billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, one of the country's richest men, over
accusations that he and others defrauded PNB of $44 million.

It was not immediately known if the latest disclosure on fraudulent
transactions was related to or separate from the previous incident.

Four top PNB executives contacted by Reuters did not immediately respond
requests seeking comment beyond the stock exchange filing. ($1 = 64.1000

**Denying Nehru his due**

Updated: February 14, 2018 9:01 am

If Modi is able to give the gift of a swachch Bharat (clean India) to Gandhi
on his 150th birthday in 2019, as he promised from the Red Fort in 2014, he
will be called the architect of swachch Bharat, though thousands of his
colleagues have worked on the project. Leadership matters. (Express Photo by
Tashi Tobgyal)

In his widely noted parliament speech on February 7, Prime Minister Narendra
Modi made the following claim about India’s democracy. “India did not get
democracy due to Pandit Nehru, as Congress wants us to believe. Please look at
our rich history. There are many examples of rich democratic traditions that
date back centuries ago. Democracy is integral to this nation and is in our
culture.” Modi called attention to the ancient Indian polities, especially
those inspired by the Buddh paramapara (Buddhist tradition). He concluded that
“loktantra hamaari ragon mein hai” (democracy is in our blood).

How valid are these claims? Two analytically distinguishable issues require
discussion. Were ancient Indian polities democratic, democracy thus
representing India’s enduring culture? And what was Nehru’s role in
institutionalising democracy?

To answer these questions, we need to start with a conceptual question: What
is democracy? For at least two and a half centuries scholars have debated
democracy. Two conceptions of democracy have emerged: A narrower concept, and
a broader one.

The narrower concept is purely electoral. It focuses on (a) contestation and
(b) participation. The first means the capacity of political parties freely to
contest the incumbent government in elections. The second points to adult
universal franchise. The right to vote should not depend on caste, creed,
race, ethnicity, income, gender or religion.

The broader notion of democracy goes beyond elections. It also speaks of
politics between elections. Special note is taken of three freedoms — freedom
of speech, freedom of religious practice, and freedom of association — without
which everyday politics can become authoritarian, despite free elections.

In what sense were ancient Indian polities democratic? Did they satisfy the
narrow conception, let alone the broader one? Did they have elected
governments? How widespread was the franchise? One can indeed find polities in
ancient India where kings bound themselves to assemblies and debates. But
kings were unelected, and very few subjects had the privilege of participating
in political debates.

That there was discussion and debate (charchaa and vichaar vimarsh, as Modi
put it) in several ancient Indian polities is beyond doubt, but democracy goes
beyond such constrained contestation. Some scholars have used terms like
“oligarchies” for systems that encouraged limited assembly and debate, but
didn’t have elected governments or broad citizen participation.

The “democracies” of the ancient city-states of Greece also had this problem.
While going quite far towards popular constraints on governments, they
excluded women and slaves from their assemblies.

Indeed, as late as the 19th century, the idea that everyone should have the
right to political participation had few takers. Europe accorded the right to
vote on the basis of property, education and gender, for it was believed that
only the propertied and educated men had the rational capacities to vote.
Women and the poor did not. Nineteenth century democracy satisfied only one
half of the narrower concept of democracy: Contestation. Universal
participation was an anathema.

Consider, also, the claims of John Stuart Mill, arguably the father of modern
liberalism. In the 1860s, he wrote that (a) for their political enhancement,
the Scots and Welsh in Britain required England’s tutelage, and the Basques
and Bretons in France would benefit from Parisian cultural tuitions, and (b)
while white British colonies deserved democratic government, non-white
colonies did not. As Uday Singh Mehta argues in Liberalism and Empire, Mill
viewed white colonies as “of similar civilisation to the ruling country,
capable of representative government: Such as the British possessions in
America and Australia”. And non-white colonies included “others, like India
(that) are still at a great distance from that state”. The latter deserved
colonial tutelage, not democracy.

Claims about differential worth of human beings were also present in India,
especially taking the form of the caste system. To talk about India’s ancient
democracies, as Modi did, and ignore the caste system, legitimated by the
Manusmriti dating back to the 2nd century BC, a text that heaps indignities on
the “lower” castes, can’t be called a plausible claim about democracy being
“integral to Indian culture”. Caste inequalities were also in India’s blood.
There is much to be proud of in ancient India, especially its scientific
discoveries such as the decimal system and the heliocentric view of the
planetary system, but democracy was not one of them.

Nehru departed from the old prejudices. He contended that universal franchise,
including poor and rich, educated and uneducated, men and women, upper and
lower castes, was based on the great 20th-century premise that “each person
should be treated as having equal political and social value”. Nehru also
endorsed the broader freedoms: “Civil liberty is not merely for us an airy
doctrine or a pious wish, but something which we consider essential for the
orderly development and progress of the nation”. This was the reason why,
despite admiring the Soviet Union for its economic achievements in the 1930s
and 1940s, he would claim that “Communism, for all its triumphs in many
fields, crushes the free spirit of man”.

Modi is right to say that Nehru alone did not produce India’s democracy. In
the Constituent Assembly, there was no great resistance to the idea of
universal franchise. But Nehru and Ambedkar led the argument about citizen
equality as a foundation for the new polity. Despite his differences with
Ambedkar, Gandhi also believed in such equality, but his life’s energies were
focused on securing India’s freedom, not on the post-Independence constitution
or polity.

Consider an analogy. If Modi is able to give the gift of a swachch Bharat
(clean India) to Gandhi on his 150th birthday in 2019, as he promised from the
Red Fort in 2014, he will be called the architect of swachch Bharat, though
thousands of his colleagues have worked on the project. Leadership matters.

Nehru has a similar relationship with democracy (as does Ambedkar with the
Constitution). Without the first three universal-franchise elections — 1952,
1957, 1962 — under Nehru’s leadership, when democracies were collapsing in
developing countries, it is hard to imagine the institutionalisation of
democracy in India. Ancient polities did not create, or sustain, India’s
post-1947 democracy.

**Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train to start a year earlier, work set to begin in June** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: Work on the bullet train, one of the

Narendra Modi

government’s signature projects, appears to be moving at high speed.

Civil work on the 508km-long Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor (MAHSR)
has been fast-tracked to begin in June this year and railway authorities have
advanced the completion deadline to August 15, 2022, from 2023 earlier, to
coincide with 75 years of India’s independence.

An official of the

National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd

(

NHSRCL

), which is the implementing body, said, “Geo-technical surveys have already
been done and civil works will begin in June 2018 after we receive the green
signal for the entire corridor.”

Tests have also been carried out beneath the sea bed for the underground
section of the project, which extends from

Bandra-Kurla Complex

(BKC) to Boisar. Of the 21km underground, almost 7km will be beneath the sea.

The project is aimed at reducing travel time between Mumbai and Ahmedabad to
roughly two hours from its present eight-hour duration. The corridor which
falls within the

Western Railway zone

extends from BKC to Sabarmati.

The official said, “Land acquisition is yet to begin but misinformation is
being spread. For example, farmers are worried that soil will be dumped in
their fields and it will make their land untillable. Also, some fear that
access from one side of the train corridor to the other will be blocked.
Maharashtra recently appointed a liaison officer and we hope that misgivings
are resolved to the satisfaction of all.”

In Maharashtra, land acquisition will be needed most in Palghar district.

**Why Arvind Kejriwal Hasn't Tweeted The Word 'Modi' In 11 Months** 

 ______ 
Arvind Kejriwal has never tagged PM Modi in any of his tweets in 2017 and 2018
so far. (File photo)

**New Delhi: **

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose government completes three years
in office on Wednesday, is now a quieter person vis-a-vis targeting his bitter
political rival -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Mr Kejriwal, with 13 million followers on Twitter, has not tweeted the word
""Modi"" even once in the past 11 months. His last tweet mentioning PM Modi was
on March 9, 2017. In 2016, he had mentioned ""Modi"" 124 times in his tweets and
33 times in 2017 -- mostly attacking the Prime Minister.

Party leaders and political analysts say the change from tweeting ""Modi
declares emergency in Delhi"", ""dictatorial Modi govt"" and ""Isn't Modi govt
anti-army"" to stopping all mention of PM Modi's name follows AAP's election
losses -- first in Punjab and Goa and then in Delhi civic polls and a by-
election from Rajouri Garden in 2017.

Also, the AAP chief has never tagged PM Modi (@narendramodi) in any of his
tweets in 2017 and 2018 so far. In 2016, he tagged the Prime Minister eight
times.

Mr Kejriwal even refrained from personally attacking the Prime Minister when
tempers between the central government and Delhi government ran high over
disqualification of 20 AAP legislators in January this year. The AAP said its
legislators were disqualified at the behest of the BJP government at the
Centre.

Party leaders and some political analysts said it was more of a strategy than
an accidental quietude.

A senior party leader said the ""conscious decision"" was taken in a meeting
that Mr Kejriwal convened after last year's debacle in Delhi civic polls in
which the AAP emerged a distant second with 48 seats after the BJP swept the
polls by winning 181 seats.

It was a big blow for the AAP that swept the Delhi elections in 2015 by
winning 67 out of 70 Assembly seats.

""It (attacking Modi) was not taking us anywhere and we decided to rather focus
on governance,"" the AAP leader said.

Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury agreed that it ""was a definite change in
(Kejriwal's) strategy"" to stop attacking PM Modi personally. ""It is evident
that the AAP has lost the trust of the middle class and they need to win back
the trust if they have to keep Delhi.""

Praveen Rai, another political analyst with the Centre for Study of Developing
Societies (CSDS), said: ""We have been seeing a much, much more sober Mr
Kejriwal. He is growing as a leader and is becoming a seasoned politician. But
he has a long way to go.""

AAP Chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj attributed the shift to ""a good
communication system (that) keeps reinventing itself"" and the party follows
that idea.

__ Comments

""Initially people wanted to know why works in Delhi were not being done and we
had to explain to them in the first two years. Now people understand that LG
is not allowing many works and files go through him,"" Mr Bharadwaj said.

He said the strategy of attacking PM Modi and the central government ""served

You see the entire country suffers with a condition where anyone who's standing behind a screen is seen as someone who has made it or someone who's perfect.

When 'the real Tendulkar' didn't perform in cricket, his effigies were burnt in front of his home. 
Treat them as human beings and not people with supernatural abilities. 

Tanmay is 'just' a comedian, and no one can/should escape criticism. I personally don't think Tanmay would be civil in a discussion or a debate. He would resort down to making fun of his opponent, because that's how his defense works. But I may be wrong, we'll never know.

Tendulkar is 'just' a cricketer, Lata Mangeshkar is 'just' a singer, Amitabh is 'just' an actor and Modi is 'just' the head of the state.

**CBI Gets Complaints Against Nirav Modi From Punjab National Bank** 

 ______ 
Nirav Modi, who's in trouble with Punjab National Bank, founded $2.3 billion
Firestar Diamond

**New Delhi: **

The CBI has received two complaints from the Punjab National Bank (PNB)
against celebrity jeweller Nirav Modi and a jewellery company, linked to a
fraud worth Rs 10,000 crore, news agency Press Trust of India said today
quoting official sources.

The CBI received the bank's complaint late last night, official sources said,
adding that the allegations are being looked into and the course of action
will be decided soon.

It's unclear whether the complaint is linked to the bank's revelation this
morning that it had detected a $1.8 billion (over Rs 11,000 crore) fraud at a
single branch in Mumbai.

India's second-biggest state-run bank said in a regulatory filing to the stock
exchange that it had detected ""fraudulent and unauthorised transactions in one
of its branches in Mumbai for the benefit of a few select account holders with
their apparent connivance"". Based on these transactions, said PNB, ""other
banks appear to have advanced money to these customers abroad"".

Nirav Modi, 48, is being investigated by the CBI, which has

filed a case against him

in connection with fraud worth Rs 280 crore.

On January 29, the Deputy General Manager of a Punjab National Bank branch in
Mumbai, Avineesh Nepalia, complained to the CBI that some officials were
causing a loss to the bank. The bank claimed that two of its officials had
issued Letters of Understanding (LoU) without following procedure and without
making entries in the systems. Eight fraud LoUs amounting to Rs 280 crore were
issued for Hong Kong-based banks.

Nirav Modi was also raided by income tax officials on January 31; his offices
in Delhi, Surat and Jaipur were searched.

Nirav Modi is the founder of $2.3 billion Firestar Diamond and counts among
his clients several world renowned celebrities. He has boutiques across three
continents - in London, New York, Las Vegas, Hawai, Singapore, Beijing and
Macau. In India, Mr Modi has his stores in Mumbai and Delhi.

__ Comments

Mr Modi was named among Forbes' list of India's Richest in 2016, with a net
worth of $ 1.74 billion.

**PNB faces claims of Rs 11,300-cr in Nirav Modi case, lenders to recall loans to Geetanjali Gems, Nirav Modi** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI/KOLKATA: Punjab National Bank is hit by the biggest ever corporate
fraud in the country running into Rs. 11,300 crores that raised questions
about its ability to survive the blow and set off disputes with half a dozen
banks requiring regulatory and government intervention, said two people
familiar with the matter.

At a noisy meeting of bankers to resolve the issue after PNB disclosed that it
is in the midst of massive fraud by employees that benefited fashion jeweller

Nirav Modi

and Gitanjali Gems owned by Mehul Choksi, it was decided that banks would
recall Rs. 11,000 crore worth of domestic loans sanctioned to the two
entities, said those people who did not want to be identified.

PNB is attempting to wriggle out of the mess by stating that it is a
`contingent liability' and that it was done without proper authorisation
though the transactions went through the globally accepted Swift messaging
system that is binding on all users.

Those banks entangled in the fraud such as the State Bank of India, Allahabad
Bank, Axis Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of India claim that the funds
were credited into PNB's Nostro account so it is the bank's liability. Nostro
account refers to an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in
another bank overseas.

""The Bank has detected some fraudulent and unauthorised transactions in one of
its branch in Mumbai for the benefit of a few select account holders with
their apparent connivance,"" PNB said in a statement. ``Based on these
transactions other banks appear to have advanced money to these customers
abroad. Liability arising out of these on the Bank shall be decided based on
the law and genuineness of underlying transactions.""

But those banks which had exposure say that it the responsibility of Punjab
National to honour the claims.

""Our Hong Kong branch had taken buyers' credit exposure against unconditional
and irrevocable Letters of Undertaking,"" said Usha Ananthasubramanian,
managing director at Allahabad Bank who earlier headed PNB. ""The money have
been credited to the Nostro account of PNB's branch. Therefore, the exposure
is clearly on PNB, We have already filed our claims.""

Allahabad Bank has Rs 2000-2200 crore exposure to PNB, which was honoring the
claims till January 5 but started defaulting from January 25.

""LoUs act as guarantee and buyers' credit normally given against 100% margin.""
said a former chairman of one of the banks involved. ""The basic liability
falls on PNB but it also needs to be seen whether proper due diligence was
performed by the other banks. It's their duty to find out whether the LoUs
were genuine,"" he said.

The fraud which has been going on since 2010 at the Brady House branch of the
bank in Mumbai came to light in January after an employee who was rolling over
the letter of understanding retired. Subsequently the claims of banks such as
Allahabad Bank, Union Bank of India and Axis Bank requests for rollover were
not honoured by the new staff overlooking the account, said bankers choosing
anonymity.

For PNB, it appears to be a major hole in the risk management with its
software not being integrated with the Swift messaging system that is used for
international transactions.

For Indian banking industry that was just about to see the end of years of bad
loans induced misery, the latest fraud is a blow that would put them behind by
a few years if the money is not quickly recovered. But the business being such
with not much underlying securities, the recovery could be meagre. The
government which decided to invest Rs. 2.1 lakh crores in capital may have to
come up with more.

 ______ 
Under flak

from opposition leaders

over

""

prurient

text"" in two

books

meant for supplementary reading of school students, the

Maharashtra

government today announced setting up of a committee

to review

their

contents

.

""Going by the sentiments expressed by opposition leaders, a committee will be
set up

to

look into the

contents

of the

books

,""

Education

Minister Vinod Tawde told reporters here.

""When these

books

were sent

to

an expert committee for selection, they did not have the

content

claimed by opposition leaders,"" he said.

The first

book

, ""Baal Nachiket"", published by Pune-based Bharatiya Vichar Saadhana, was
singled out by Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, leader of opposition.

He termed its

contents

objectionable and inappropriate for children. The

book

has words like ""loss of virginity"", ""physical pleasure"", ""sexual desire"",
which are unsuitable for children, he added.

Another

book

, ""Bhagwan Ved Vyaas"", also published by the Bharatiya Vichar Saadhana, has a
character called Matsyagandha, talking about her being a fisherman's daughter
and having a repulsive body odour.

While talking

to

Rishi Parashar, she says, ""Hey Rishi, who will accept me after I have lost my
virginity?""

In the same story, there are lines like ""Looking at the movements of her body
Rishi Parashar was possessed by sexual desires"" and ""He lustfully caught her
hand"".

""The publishing house has links with the

RSS

and the government has purchased these

books

at inflated cost,"" Vikhe Patil said.

On the decision

to

buy

books

on Prime Minister Narendra Modi as supplementary reading material in state
schools, Tawde said, ""The

books

on Modi were included because they will cover part of our history and freedom
struggle which could not be covered from the

books

on Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru.""

**The secret lives of India's ultra rich you probably had no idea about** 

 ______ 
If you think

India

's

ultra rich

would be spending a good part of their lives in luxury spas, you are wrong.
Spas don't find favour with them. And when they go on expensive holidays, they
don't pamper themselves at luxury resorts. Most would rather rent a luxury
villa and go out to soak in the local culture by mixing with the common
people.

How do India's ultra

rich

spend? How do they use internet? How do they keep fit? Are they as amenable to
trends as the commoners are? These and many other revelations are part of the
seventh edition of Top of the Pyramid Report by

Kotak Wealth Management

(KWM). It studied ultra high networth individuals (UHNIs) in India to know
their behaviour and preferences in health &amp;amp; wellness, philanthropy,
digital behaviour and family business.

India's ultra rich keep getting younger each year. About 60% of them surveyed
were below the age of 40, compared with 47% last year. These young ones are
introducing changes in consumption patterns.

For example, the ultra rich now spend the most on apparel and accessories.
This category commanded the largest share of their specific expenses.
Apparently, more young people joining the ultra rich club means more fashion
consciousness among them. The second-highest allocation of spending is for
holidays. Indian ultra rich spend more on travel and vacations to foreign
countries (average spend) than any other nationality.

Prime Minister Narendra

Modi

's various measures to curb the black economy seem to have impacted the ultra
rich too. The share of jewellery in their total spending decreased to about
12% from 17% last year. Though higher gold prices may also have contributed to
a fall in demand, the government making PAN disclosure mandatory for all
transactions and purchases above Rs 200,000 must have been a significant
reason.

Quite predictably, the most preferred fitness regime among the ultra rich is
exclusive membership to health clubs or select gyms, possibly due to the
privacy and convenience it offers.

However, despite latest trends such as virtual boxing, 360 Fitness, H.E.A.T
(high-energy athletic training), megaformers, and water workouts, the ultra
rich find yoga and walking as the most effective forms of exercise. A
significant 76% said they practised yoga. However, 38% were CrossFit users, an
indication of the number of young ones increasing in among the ultra rich.

Spas have some way to go before they can wash with Indian ultra rich. Only
about a third of them said that they visited a spa every month. Within age
groups, about 50% in the 51 to 60 category said they never visited spas. Even
in the other age groups, a significant portion were not regulars at spas. Most
in the 41 to 50 age group visited spas twice a month while more 25 to 40 year
olds were monthly visitors.

Wearable tech devices that monitor fitness could be the rage, but the ultra
rich are not enamoured of them. A little less than half wear activity tracker
FitBit. About a third use sleep headphones and MyFitnessPal, a mobile
application that tracks food intake. A quarter use Runkeeper, a mobile
application that tracks a user’s physical activity. None of the gadgets and
applications was rated very highly by them. However, more than half use blood
glucose meters.

Being a great leveller, Internet is the only place where the ultra rich go to
places same as the commoners. Across age groups, Facebook and WhatsApp are the
most favourite apps, with most visiting these at least once a day. 52% of
those who use WhatsApp visit the application more than thrice a day, while 86%
looked at Facebook at least once a day.

They are ultimately the 2 sides of the same coin and they feed on each other. One cannot survive without the other. And that's the point of the *rath yatra*. Modi and the BJP have realised that they may lose the next election and so want to polarise the electorate. They have thus been deliberately provoking the muslims. But secular political parties have convinced the muslims to not get provoked. And that is hurting the BJP's politics of polarisation as without any attacks from the *Jihadis*, and 'Hindu' victims to show for, they come off as the bad guys and the normal Hindus also feel ashamed and anger at the actions of the *Sanghis*. The moment the *Jihadis* step into the picture, and start indulging in violence too, a normal Hindu also feels insecure and suddenly starts having doubts ... and that's when polarisation happens that benefits the *Jihadis* and the *Sanghis* ...",2018-02-14 23:02:35

**New Arvind Kejriwal: CM forgoes street fights for governance** 

 ______ 
Meet

Arvind Kejriwal

3.0.

He is seldom heard and hardly seen. The rabble-rouser once ready to take to
the streets now adopts the cautious middle path. And the scarf that earned him
the sobriquet of the Muffler Man is missing.

Exactly three years after he was voted back to power, the Delhi chief minister
is a new version of the man who caught the electoral imagination of the people
of the state.

In 2015, when his Aam Aadmi Party swept the Assembly polls in Delhi, Chief
Minister Arvind Kejriwal was not just a crusader against corruption but always
ready for combat.

The tactics that typified Kejriwal are missing in the new version of the chief
minister. If the man who enthused the city to vote for him in 2013 was seen as
a champion for corrupt-free politics, Kejriwal 2.0 -- or the second avatar --
was like a street fighter.

A year before the 2015 polls, Kejriwal, who was also the chief minister then,
had called himself an ""anarchist"" when he launched a dharna on the streets
against the police.

The aggressiveness was visible even in the first two years after he returned
to power, when he took on Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

and

Congress

leaders head-on.

Kejriwal is muted in his comments now, does not take potshots at Modi, and is
seemingly focused on governance.

""Arvind is very smart. He knows that he has to change if he has to survive,""
said an AAP leader.

Party watchers believed that the changes in the AAP leader were largely a
result of the electoral reverses that he has faced in the last one year.

""Kejriwal wants to retain power at any cost,"" said Mayank Gandhi, a former
senior party member and author of the book 'AAP &amp;amp; Down: The rise and fall
of Aam Aadmi Party'.

Not many see the 49-year-old IIT alumnus as the common man's representative,
an image that the party had earlier sought to portray.

The iconic hatchback blue Wagon-R, which he used during his 49-day tenure in
2013-14, has been replaced by a multi-utility Innova car in his second term.

There is a physical change as well. In 2015, and in the following years,
Kejriwal, who suffers from high blood sugar, also went through regular
ayurvedic and other therapy to deal with a recurring throat problem. He looks
heavier in 2018 than he did in 2015.

The muffler, once held up by AAP members as a symbol of Kejriwal's simplicity
and the butt of social media jokes, was seldom seen this winter. Even his
youthful rimless glasses have been replaced by a grave and thick black frame.

But he has sailed through three tough years. After the control of the Anti-
Corruption Branch, which played a critical role in building Kejriwal's image
and his campaign against corruption in his first tenure as Delhi chief
minister, went into the hands of the Lt Governor, Kejriwal lost a potent
weapon.

In the last few years, he has faced several other hurdles. His key
legislations were not passed, his MLAs were arrested and dissent in the party
was publicly aired.

The expulsion of founder members

Prashant Bhushan

and

Yogendra Yadav

and the suspension of more than two Cabinet ministers, including Kapil Mishra,
from AAP gave the party the kind of publicity it did not need.

A Delhi High Court decision giving the Lt Governor supremacy on administrative
issues further defanged Kejriwal, as did electoral defeats in civic bodies.

AAP had national ambitions, but after the party's poor show in Punjab and Goa
in March last year, Kejriwal put his focus on Delhi -- concentrating on issues
such as mohalla clinics and government schools.

""But Arvind's core personality has not changed. He is keeping quiet and
launching fewer attacks (on his opponents). These strategies have helped him,
so he prefers to follow this path,"" said the AAP leader.

Gandhi said Kejriwal might have changed, but he was still ""ruthless"".

""Earlier, I agreed to his ruthlessness because it was for the better of the
country. Now it is to retain power,"" Gandhi added.

**PNB cautions other banks about modus operandi of fraud**

NEW DELHI: Hit by a Rs 11,400 crore fraud, state-owned

Punjab National Bank

(

PNB

) has cautioned other banks about the modus operandi of the scam.

""It has been reported through a preliminary investigation that the suspected
fraud has been carried out by the perpetrators in collusion with the staff of
one of our branches in Mumbai,"" PNB said in a letter sent to various banks,
including those from the private and public sector as also to foreign lenders.

**Punjab National Bank fraud: Top developments**

The letter said it was found through the SWIFT trail that one junior level
official unauthorisedly and fraudulently issued Letters of Undertaking (LoUs)
on behalf of some companies belonging to

Nirav Modi

Group.

The companies were maintaining only current accounts with the branch and none
of the transactions were routed though the Centralised Banking System, it
said.

Similar modus operandi was used by the same official for companies belonging
to Gitanjali Gems promoted by Mehul Choksi.

PNB said that RBI norms were overlooked by overseas branches of other Indian
banks and alleged connivance of group companies of Nirav Modi and Gitanjali
Gems with its own official and also apparently of others working in foreign
branches of Indian banks.

The fraudulent act was found out when subsequent to superannuation of the
concerned official, the same companies again approached the branch for
availing Letter of Undertakings (LoUs).

**Women hold over 50% of Jan Dhan accounts** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: In what marks a boost for financial inclusion, more than half of PM

Jan Dhan

Yojna account-holders are

women

and they are also carrying out transactions rather than merely opening
accounts, a sample survey by a financial inclusion consulting firm has
indicated.

The “State of the Agent Network 2017” report released by Microsave on
Wednesday found that there has been a more than 200% increase in volumes of
cashin, cash-out between 2015 and 2017. The

Modi

government’s drive to encourage opening of these accounts was to offer banking
services to the poor for more reliable transfer of government benefits and to
enable the less well off to avail credit or loans.

The transactions are increasing as the bank agents or business correspondents
offer more products and services such as linking of

Aadhaar

to bank accounts, insurance registration and balance inquiry. Moreover,
government-to-people payments such as direct transfer of cash, has led to
increase in transactions.

Aadhar linkage and mobile use are key elements in the inclusion scheme. Banks
appoint entities and individuals as agents for providing basic banking
services in remote areas where they can’t practically start a branch.
Releasing the agent network report, chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian
said while India has made a lot of progress on the financial inclusion front,
gaps remain.

“You have gas cylinders but you need consistent gas offtake; you have bank
accounts but you need to make genuine inclusion; your toilets are built, but
are they used? I think that’s the next stage we need to work on....That is
why, the banking correspondents story needs more work,” he said.

The report has recommended the need to take steps to increase the share of
women agents from the present of only 2%, which could give a fillip to the
financial inclusion of women. The report is based on a nationwide
representative research that covered 3,048 businesses correspondents

**""Break Up With Hatred"": Congress' Valentine's Day Message For PM Modi** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

On Valentine's Day, the Congress tweeted a heart-infused video to Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, with ""love"" and a little bite. ""Spread love, not

_jumlas_

,"" said the message, with a popular Bollywood song as its theme.

""Dear Mr Modi, A happy Valentine's Day from us to you,"" says the minute-long
video posted on the Congress's official Twitter handle. Among its many digs,
the party urges: ""Hug less, work more"" and ""Break up with hatred"".

The tweet reinforces the party's offensive against the BJP-led government over
plans to provide health insurance cover to the poor and hold simultaneous
state and national elections, criticizing them as

_jumla_

, or gimmicks.

""Like every relationship, make promises that you can keep,"" it says, referring
to PM Modi talking about the huge amount of black money stashed away abroad
that could be enough to deposit Rs 15 lakh in each bank account.

This was the second message from the Congress aimed at the BJP. Earlier in the
day, the Congress had posted on Valentine's Day a sketch - two red hearts, a
white moustache and a saffron scarf - that sought to spread the message of
love. ""This day and every day, we hope that love continues to win over hate,""
the party tweeted, taking a cue from its chief Rahul Gandhi, who had said
recently that the Congress would ""respond with love to every attack"".

The BJP has not reacted to the tweet yet.

Earlier this week, the Congress posted a video targeting the Prime Minister
for his joke on party lawmaker Renuka Chowdhury's laughter in the Rajya Sabha.

In a stinging response, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said the Congress
had given up on serious political commentary and was functioning as a ""B-grade
video production house"" with a flippant message. ""The party is now operating
at the level of Rahul Gandhi's IQ,"" Mr Rao had said.

**Who Saved Nirav Modi, Asks Congress, Targeting PM With ""Chhota Modi"" Dig** 

 ______ 
The photo held up by Congress was first tweeted by MEA when PM Modi was in
Davos.

**New Delhi: **

Opposition leaders held up a photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with
leading Indian industrialists at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland's
Davos today, asking how billionaire diamond merchant and jeweler

Nirav Modi was allowed to leave the country

reportedly days before a first information report was filed accusing him of a
massive 11,360 crore fraud.

In the photo from late January, PM Modi is sitting in the centre and in the
rows of industrialists standing behind is Nirav Modi, who the Congress today
christened ""

_Chhota_

Modi (Little Modi),"" alleging that he used clout with the government to slip
out of the country.

It has been confirmed that Nirav Modi left India on January 1. The case
against him was registered on January 31 and the police posted a ""look out""
notice for him after that.

""Guide to Looting India by Nirav MODI 1. Hug PM Modi 2. Be seen with him in
DAVOS Use that clout to: A. Steal 12,000Cr B. Slip out of the country like
Mallya, while the Govt looks the other way,"" tweeted Congress president Rahul
Gandhi.

His party's spokesperson Randeep Surejewala asked if Nirav Modi had been
tipped off and so could leave the country, saying, ""Who is Nirav Modi? The new
#ModiScam? Was he tipped off like Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya to escape by
someone within the government?""

Other opposition parties too made comparisons with liquor baron Vijay Mallya,
who left the country in the middle of attempts by banks to recover unpaid
loans from him.

Left leader Sitaram Yechury demanded a clarification from the government. ""If
this person had fled India before the FIR on Jan 31, then he is here,
photographed at Davos with PM, a week before the FIR, after having escaped
from India? Modi govt must clarify,"" he said, tweeting the Davos photo.

He also alleged, ""There is a pattern in how people who have defrauded Banks in
India, are allowed to escape by the Modi government.""

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, ""Is it possible to believe that he
or Vijay Mallya left the country without active connivance of the BJP
government?

On Thursday,

teams of investigators searched Nirav Modi's properties

, a day after Punjab National Bank, India's second-largest government bank,
reported that Rs. 11,000-crore was illegally transferred abroad by its own
officials from a single Mumbai branch to help the jeweler and others get
credit without guarantees and in violation of rules.

The Enforcement Directorate is investigating complaints that Nirav Modi and
his associates who were involved in cheating Punjab National Bank of over a
swindle worth Rs. 280 crore.

The CBI had earlier raided Nirav Modi, 47, his brother, wife and a business
associate Mehul Chinubhai Choksi for the alleged swindle.

__ Comments

Nirav Modi, who has figured in the Forbes' list of richest Indians, was booked
by the CBI for cheating after PNB sent a complaint to it alleging that the
jewellery firm owner, his brother, wife and Choksi entered into a criminal
conspiracy with the officials of the bank and cheated it, causing a ""wrongful
loss"".

The fraud was revealed when Nirav Modi's companies sought a fresh loan, PNB
has said, stating today that it was the first to detect that fraud and
asserting its ""commitment to clean banking."" The bank has suspended 10

**China denounces Narendra Modi’s Arunachal visit, says don’t complicate border dispute**

**Beijing:** China on Thursday expressed anger over a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, and said India should stop any action that might complicate the dispute.

China claims the region in the eastern Himalayas as “South Tibet”, and it has
denounced Indian leaders’ visits there as attempts to bolster India’s claims.

“China’s position on the China-India boundary question is consistent and
clear-cut,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement
carried by the official _Xinhua_ news agency.

“The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh
and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader’s visit to the disputed area,” Geng
said.

“We will lodge stern representations with the Indian side,” he said.

Modi is visiting as part of a tour of India’s northeastern states.

“I am delighted to visit Arunachal Pradesh and be among the wonderful people
of this state,” Modi said in a Twitter post.

China and India have improved ties in recent years but there is still deep
distrust over their long festering border dispute, which triggered a brief war
in 1962.

Chinese and Indian troops faced off on another disputed part of the border
last year.

Chinese spokesman Geng said China and India had reached an important consensus
on properly managing disputes, and the two sides were working to resolve their
contested border through negotiation and consultation.

“The Chinese side urges the Indian side to honour its commitment and abide by
the relevant consensus, and refrain from taking any action that may complicate
the boundary question,” Geng said.

Modi is expected to visit China in June for a summit of the Chinese and
Russian-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation security bloc.

Modi inaugurated a convention centre in the Arunachal Pradesh state capital of
Itanagar and said the state authorities had prepared an excellent roadmap for
development until 2027. **Reuters**

**""Think Traffic Lights. Red Stops Development"": PM Modi Tells Tripura** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed two election rallies in Tripura today.

**Agartala: **

With just three days to go for the elections in Tripura, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi added finishing touches to high-voltage election campaign of the
BJP, which is out to oust the well-entrenched Left government in the state.
Accusing the blocking development in the state, PM Modi said the party managed
to rule the state for 25 years only because there was a Congress-led
government at the Centre for much of it.

""They had a pact. In Delhi, they have

_dosti_

(friendship) and in Tripura they have

_kushti _

(wrestling),"" the Prime Minister said. The lack of development in the state
under the Left-regime, he said, was the reason why he received so much
affection. As case in point, he cited the crowds at his rallies.

""I need to apologise since we could not accommodate people in the field.
Today, from the helipad till this ground, I saw a human wall,"" PM Modi said in
Agartala, where his second rally of the day was held.

""Can anyone from Tripura say development is really taking place? Red stops
development as the red light stops cars at a traffic signal. For the lights to
turn green, you need saffron first,"" the Prime Minister said.

This was PM Modi's second visit to the state. On February 8, he had addressed
a rally in Sonamura, where he had taken on the state's three-time Chief
Minister Manik Sarkar.

__ Comments

Over the last months, the BJP had conducted a high-profile campaign, bringing
in senior cabinet ministers and state Chief Ministers to the tiny northeaster
state. Besides PM Modi, Union ministers Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, BJP chief
Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have campaigned in
the state.

The party already controls three of the eight northeastern states - Assam,
Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. This time, it hopes to win in all three states
that are going to polls - Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Tripura will be its
first effort to win over a non-Congress state, which is expected to provide a
blueprint for the party's two big targets - Left-ruled Kerala and Mamata
Banerjee's Bengal.

**PM Modi’s brother says many not getting ration in Gujarat due to glitches in Aadhaar-based verification system** 

 ______ 
By:

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Published: February 15, 2018 8:19 pm

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s younger brother, Prahlad Modi, claimed that the
E-FPS system is creating problems in ensuring the smooth disbursal of the
ration.

Several people have been denied their monthly ration at fair price shops in
Gujarat due to technical glitches in an Aadhaar-based authentication system
which is used to validate beneficiaries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s
younger brother, Prahlad Modi, told PTI on Thursday. Prahlad Modi is president
of Gujarat Fair Price Shop Owners Association.

The Gujarat government had launched ‘Maa Annapurna Yoyana’ in April 2016 to
provide subsidised food-grains to eligible beneficiaries through 17,000-odd
ration (fair price) shops under the National Food Security Act. The fair price
shops are linked with a central database through an E-FPS software system
which validates beneficiaries. Under the system, a beneficiary must provide
Aadhaar details and thumb impression to avail his or her quota of ration.

Prahlad Modi claimed that the E-FPS system is creating problems in ensuring
the smooth disbursal of the ration. “There are a number of problems with the
software. Sometimes it does not read the thumb impression and doesn’t accept
Aadhaar card details when it takes a little longer to process. At times, there
is a problem while logging in as the software runs slow,” he told PTI.

He demanded that the government iron out the problems soon, and, in the
meantime, the fair price shop owners should be allowed to use the old manual
system.

“The government should provide an alternative so that a customer is not forced
to go back empty-handed. It should also provide training to shop owners on how
to operate the software,” he added.

Modi and other members of his association met senior officials of the Food,
Civil Supply and Consumer Affairs Department in this regard yesterday. “The
government has agreed that no beneficiary should be forced to go back without
subsidised food-grains due to the problems in the software. It has assured
that some alternative will be provided until the problems are sorted out,” he
said.

**PNB fraud case: ED conducts raid, bank assures action; BJP fumes as Congress calls Nirav ‘Chota Modi’**

Updated: February 15, 2018 8:43 pm

PNB fraud case: Ravi Shankar Prasad also clarified that Nirav Modi was not
part of the delegation to Davos led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and had
reached there on his own.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has lashed out at Congress after its leader
Randeep Surjewala referred to billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, whose firm is
involved in Rs 11,000 crore fraud at the Punjab National Bank, as ‘Chota
Modi’. “What is this word ‘Chhota Modi’? BJP takes strong offence to the kind
of language being used by describing someone like that. It is derogatory,
scandalous and demeaning,” said Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday
in a press conference.

The minister rubbished Congress charges that the government has helped Nirav
in leaving the country. He also rejected the Congress claim that Prime
Minister Narendra had met Nirav during his visit to Davos for the World
Economic Forum. “Nirav Modi did not meet PM Modi at Davos. Nirav Modi had
arrived in Davos on his own and was present at CII group photo event,” claimed
Prasad.

Congress leader Randeep Surjewala, had earlier in the day, showed a picture in
which Nirav can be seen along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his
visit to Davos. Surjewala also alleged that the Prime Minister’s Office was
informed about the alleged fraud in July 2016, but it did not act in the
matter.

“Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, was made aware of this entire fraud by
one Shri Hari Prasad by way of a written complaint filed on 26th July, 2016
and acknowledged by PMO,” said Surjewala, adding that “no action was taken”
and the “bank lost the money and the accused escaped.” He also alleged that PM
Modi was aware of 42 FIRs pending against the absconding.

Responding to the photograph, Prasad said, “Congress photo ki rajneeti bandh

Mehul Choksi is available with us, but we don’t want to stoop to that level.”.

Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, had earlier in the day, tweeted: “Guide to
looting India by Nirav Modi–1. Hug PM Modi 2. Be seen with him in DAVOS. Use
that clout to: A. Steal 12,000 crore B. Slip out of the country like Mallya,
while the government looks the other way,” Gandhi tweeted.

The Congress alleged that the NDA government was looking the other way when
Modi used his clout with the prime minister to slip out of the country and
steal Rs 12,000 crore, drawing a comparison with the case of liquor baron
Vijay Mallya.

State-owned Punjab National Bank had on Wednesday said that it had detected a
USD 1.77 billion (about Rs 11,400 crore) scam where Nirav Modi allegedly
acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from a branch in Mumbai to secure
overseas credit from other Indian lenders.

**ED raids diamond trader Nirav Modi**

A day after the massive fraud was unearthed in a PNB branch, the Enforcement
Directorate on Thursday launched a nationwide raid on the offices, showrooms
and workshops of Nirav Modi. ED teams carried out simultaneous raids on Modi’s
offices, showrooms and diamond workshops in Mumbai, Surat (Gujarat) and New
Delhi.

ED officials landed at Firestar Diamond Pvt Ltd. head office in Bharat Diamond
Bourse, in Bandra Kurla Complex, Modi’s private office at Kohinoor City in
Kurla West, his showroom and boutique at Itts House in Fort in south Mumbai
and a workshop in Peninsula Business Park in Lower Parel.

In Gujarat, six diamond workshops were raided in Surat SEZ at Sachin town and
an office in Belgium Towers on Ring Road, the hub of diamond jewellery trade.
Two diamond jewellery boutiques of Modi in New Delhi – in Chanakyapuri and
Defence Colony – were also raided.

&gt; — ANI (@ANI) February 15, 2018

At least 10 bank employees have been suspended but it is not clear whether
anybody from the crucial PNB Credit Approval Committee or its Board of
Directors figure among them.

The fraud, which includes money-laundering among others, concerns the Firestar
Diamonds group in which the CBI last week booked Modi, his wife Ami, brother
Nishal and a maternal uncle Mehul Choksi. It followed a complaint lodged by
PNB on January 29 pertaining to an alleged cheating case of Rs 280 crore
perpetrated by these four in 2011.

**PNB assures action**

The Punjab National Bank (PNB) said it will take “full-capacity” action
against the wrong doers in the Rs 11,400-crore Nirav Modi fraud case, which
started in 2011. PNB CMD Sunil Mehta told reporters, “In the last 123 years,
we have seen many ups and down. The bank at its full capacity will take every
action to book wrongdoers.

Punjab National Bank Managing Director Nirav Modi addresses the media in
Mumbai on Thursday. (Photo: Twitter/ANI)

“This fraud had started in 2011. Our own bank detected first and told the law
enforcement agencies about this. PNB is fully committed to its clean banking
policy. That is why we are the first one to detect and report this to the
various law enforcement agencies,” he added.

**Where is Nirav Modi?**

According to CBI, Nirav Modi had left the country on January 1 much before the
CBI received a complaint from Punjab National Bank on January 29 about a Rs
280-crore fraud. He is believed to be in Switzerland.

Nirav’s brother Nishal, a Belgian citizen, also left the country on January 1,
while wife Ami, a US citizen, and business partner Mehul Choksi, the Indian
promoter of Gitanjali jewellery chain, departed on January 6, officials said.

The CBI issued a look out circular against all the four after registering the
first FIR against them, they said. A look out circular is issued by
enforcement agencies to all exit and entry ports to inform them about the
movement of an accused. **READ MORE **

You guys won a huge majority in 2014 and you're squandering a chance to effect real change by supporting criminals, rioters. You have an obssession with cows that borders on unhealthy. And your financial and foreign policy has been one series  of bungles after another. 

You don't have to be far left, or even anti-BJP, to realise that the country is not experience good times (acche din). They are in fact bure din. The only difference between Randia and other media sources is that we are not yet controlled by an army of supportive bots (I'm talking mostly twitter, but also FB).

1. Randia is not representative of the country's population by any means. Most people in this sub are either college educated or working class folks from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.

2. Most here lean left of the political spectrum, which you can call as liberal. There are other Indian subs which have more right leaning users.

3. BJP doing well in many states is not equal to majority of randians are from those states or ones who voted for BJP. And when you say ""doing well"", do you mean BJP's election performance or BJP government's performance? I voted for BJP in 2014 election because of how sick and tired I was of Congress and today I am vehemently against BJP, thanks to BJP IT cell and their politicians starting from Modi. I dont support any other party, but I vehemently dispise BJP for many reasons.

4. Most here didnt support policies of BJP like Demonitization. And add social issues like cow vigilantism, right wing online propoganda, violence on minorities, .... there are enough reasons to argue against BJP. 

5. Most of us feel that BJP just like every other political party is ""all talk and no work"".  

6. Right wing groups like VHP and RSS routinely indulge in violence to suppresd others. The recent controversy on movie Padmaavat was evident of that even though the culprit was a different group. ",2018-02-15 21:12:32

**Why 2019 isn’t quite a done deal for the BJP** 

 ______ 
February is arguably the nicest month weather-wise in the national capital.
The icy Himalayan wind gives way to a gentler breeze signalling a gradual
change of seasons. This time, it also marks a possible shift in political
temperature ahead of a big election year with the Congress suddenly finding
its voice on a range of issues from the economy to the Rafael aircraft deal
even as the aura of invincibility around the ruling leadership is eroded.

Two by-election results in Rajasthan appear to have been the immediate trigger
for the shift in political momentum. Resounding victories for the Congress in
the Lok Sabha seats of Alwar and Ajmer (the party led in all 16 assembly
segments) suggest that 2019 may not quite be 2014. Remember, the BJP swept all
25 seats in Rajasthan in the 2014 general elections, part of a north-west
India wave stretching from Goa to Jharkhand that propelled the party to a
remarkable majority on its own. Now, the defeat in Rajasthan suggests that the
saffron surge of 2014 may be beginning to slow down.

But is Rajasthan a mirror to the rest of India, or merely an aberration? The
BJP’s mascot in the twin Rajasthan elections was not Narendra Modi, but the
state chief minister Vasundhara Raje. To that extent, the by-election results
would suggest mounting anti-incumbency against the state government.
Rajasthan, after all, has a history in recent times of voting out the
incumbent government every five years.

And yet, the BJP leadership can no longer be complacent. The agrarian distress
is real and nationwide. Farmers have been temporarily placated with budgetary
promises but translating the promise into delivery is this government’s
biggest challenge. The promise of 10 million new jobs a year is clearly not
happening, and wrapping it up in a plate of ‘pakodas’ is not going to address
the ambitions of India’s young. So far, the growing disillusionment of the
unrealised ‘achche din’ has not turned to anger, but that, too, can change in
the next 12 months if there is no visible improvement on the ground.

One sign of the shifting mood is reflected on social media, the echo chamber
of contemporary urban political discourse. Where once the BJP and Modi in
particular ruled cyberspace, now there are Modi jokes that are going viral.
The union budget, far from stemming the tide, has only aggravated the sense of
disquiet. For the urban middle class in particular, the budget offers little
hope that their wallets will have a distinct bulge in the immediate future.

Which might also explain the growing belief that the Modi government is
seeking to quickly shift the political narrative away from the economy to more
emotional issues revolving around religious nationalism. That the East Delhi
BJP MP Mahesh Giri has chosen to launch a Rashtriya Raksha Yagna in a week
when there has been yet another major terror attack in Jammu is not without
significance: the ‘maha-yagna’ is a conscious attempt to stir a religio-
national fervour ahead of the election season. The RSS chief has already
offered his swayam-sevaks for border protection ‘if the constitution permits’.
The VHP has also announced its plans to reignite the Ram Mandir issue even as
the Supreme Court hears the contentious dispute. The early signs from
Karnataka too suggest that the BJP is looking to create a Hindu consolidation
by raising the familiar bogey of Muslim appeasement.

And yet, whether an unapologetic old-style Hindutva politics can deliver the
spectacular results of 2014 for a ‘new’ India is uncertain. That election
triumph was driven by strong public anger against the ruling Congress-led UPA
with Modi’s muscular image embodying the face of change. That image has been
dented but remains well ahead of what Rahul Gandhi and the opposition have to
offer so far. A fragmented opposition may well be Modi’s ticket to a second
term in power. He is still the consummate election campaigner who will
determinedly make the general elections a presidential contest between him
versus Rahul and the rest. And yet, while the prime minister’s supporters seek
to keep his larger than life image intact, the Indian voter has a history of
eventually slicing through the rhetoric. Indeed, what appeared a done deal
just months ago is no longer guaranteed. The battle for 2019 has only just
begun.

Post-script: A senior Congress leader in parliament insisted before a large
group of journalists that Modi would not be prime minister unless the BJP got
220 seats on its own in 2019. That the remarks were made within earshot of
several MPs from the BJP’s increasingly restive allies was interesting. Is 220
the new 272 and can Modi lead a genuine coalition government? Those are the
questions that are still blowing in the February wind.

443,"From what I could understand

PNB gave letter of undertaking (LoU) for Nirav Modi (NM). LoU is effectively a bank guarantee (BG). BG is a promise by the bank that they will pay in case the buyer fails to pay. Generally used as buyer needs to check goods, might not have cash immediately etc. Buyer generally deposits money etc in the bank for LoU/BG. A supplier gives the goods and he is given BG instead of money with the promise that within 90 days the buyer will give the money. If buyer fails, the BG/LoU will be encashed. This default event rarely happens and if it happens, bank will be very proactive and squeeze the buyer, take over inventory, stop all accounts etc. 

NM took the LoU/BG and went to overseas branches of Allahabad bank and other banks and got them to issue loans to pay his suppliers. It is not clear who these suppliers are. It is also not clear if NM has defaulted on these loans.

Because there is no money being transferred by bank in LoU/BG, it is called non-fund facility. Terms loans, working capital loans involve cash transfer and are called fund based facilities. This is important as PNB head in the press conference didn't tell us if NM is defaulting or BG has been encashed.

The employees of PNB didn't enter this LoU/BG in the banking system in 2011 and the Bank was not aware of the existence of the LoU/BG. The problem cropped up when NM went to PNB and asked them to reissue the LoU/BG (assuming it is expiring).",2018-02-15 21:52:21

This places the liability on PNB now to repay the overseas branches since the LoUs were issued by PNB and Modi has no intention of repaying those overseas branches.
This happened because the Core Banking Solution used by PNB had no record of these LoUs. These LoUs were made over SWIFT, which is an international system used for financial transactions. The SWIFT changes were not recorded in PNB's CBS. This scam came to light when the PNB employee okaying the LoUs retired and Modi's Companies approached a new employee for credit.

**Rs 3,000-Crore 'Statue Of Unity' Of Sardar Patel To Be Ready For Inauguration On October 31** 

 ______ 
The Gujarat government is aiming to inaugurate the 182-metre tall 'Statue of
Unity', dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, on October 31, the birth
anniversary of India's first home minister.

The towering monument, being erected at Sadhu Bet, 3.32 km from the Sardar
Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river at Kevadia, about 100-km from here, will be
ready for inauguration on October 31, Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh said.

Twitter

The foundation stone of the monument, a dream project of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi, was laid on October 31, 2013, coinciding with the 138th birth
anniversary of Patel, popularly known as the 'Iron Man of India'.

Modi, who was then Gujarat Chief Minister, laid the foundation stone of the
nearly Rs 3,000-crore project, being built on a public-private partnership
(PPP) basis by engineering giant L&amp;amp;T under the supervision of the Sardar
Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL).

The memorial is dedicated to Patel, credited with integrating 562 princely
states with the Union of India.

Post completion, the 'Statue of Unity' will be the world's tallest statue,
according to the project's website.

The 'Statue of Unity' will provide visitors a meaningful experience that both
educates and entertains, by focusing on Patel's personage, life, and
accomplishments.

Additionally, a viewing gallery at around 500-feet will provide visitors a
spectacular view of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and its environs, the website said.

The project will also house an audio-visual gallery, a laser light and sound
show on the life of Patel and a virtual tour of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, among
other things.

**Amid Investigation At Home, Nirav Modi At New York Apartment: Sources** 

 ______ 
Nirav Modi is being investigated in connection with Rs 11,300 crore Punjab
National Bank scam

**New York: **

Celebrity jeweller Nirav Modi, who left India just days before the CBI started
investigating him in connection with a Rs. 11,300 crore Punjab National Bank
(PNB) scam, has been traced to an apartment in New York's Manhattan.

Sources have told NDTV that he is staying in a suite at JW Marriott's Essex
House

, a short walk away from his luxe Madison Avenue jewellery retail store.

Yesterday, the government said his passport would be revoked and ""no one, no
matter how big, would be spared"".

Nirav Modi, his family members and business partner Mehul Choksi are accused
of getting billions in credit from banks overseas after using PNB officials in
Mumbai to issue fraud guarantees.

Nirav Modi's apartment at JW Marriott's Essex House is a short walk away from
his Madison Avenue store

The diamond billionaire left India on January 1 and was last seen in a group
photo with Indian business leaders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Davos,
taken on the sidelines of a summit on January 23.  
  
NDTV accessed his upscale suite on the 36th floor, with a view of the Central
Park, on Thursday afternoon. Staff at the apartment said Nirav Modi and his
wife were out, only his children were home. ""The news is only in India, he is
safe in America right?"" an employee questioned.  

There was much activity at the apartment on Wednesday night, NDTV learnt, when
multiple people gathered there around the same time the news of the giant bank
scam broke in India. Hotel staff claimed to have seen the 48-year-old Nirav
Modi, who is unusually reticent, well into the night. His wife Ami Modi was
seen entering and exiting the building frequently during the day.

At the Madison Avenue showroom, employees gave this statement: ""This matter
has no affiliation, legal or otherwise with Firestar International Limited
which is the flagship enterprise of Mr. Nirav Modi.""

Nirav Modi, being investigated in PNB scam, is staying at a suite in JW
Marriott's Essex House: sources

At the time of publishing this article, NDTV was waiting for a promised call
from Nirav Modi's US management. NDTV has also reached out to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice and State Department and is
waiting for a response.  
  
Yesterday, Enforcement Directorate officials raided Nirav Modi's home, offices
and showrooms in multiple cities and seized gold, diamond and precious stones
worth Rs 5,100 crore.  
  
The bank scam was revealed when a consortium of companies related to Nirav
Modi asked for fresh guarantees for overseas credit last month. When the bank
asked for 100 per cent cash guarantees in exchange for Letters of
Understanding, the companies allegedly said they never did that before. On
investigating, the bank uncovered Letters of Understanding issued illegally by
officials who had since retired. Letters of Understanding are bank guarantees
for lenders.  
  
On January 29, the bank complained to the CBI about a Rs. 280-crore fraud,
officials said. The investigating agency filed an FIR or formal case two days
later, against Nirav Modi, his brother, wife and Mehul Choksi.  
  

__ Comments

The CBI learnt that all four had gone abroad and issued a look-out circular in
the first week of February.

Earlier this week, PNB declared that the scam was far bigger and involved a
swindle of over Rs 11,300 crore.
