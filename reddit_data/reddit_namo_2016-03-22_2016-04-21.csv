&gt; * NEW DELHI: Congress today targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a CAG report that questions the Gujarat government's investment in Krishna Godavari (KG) block project, saying it ""exposes the myth of Gujarat model and brand Namo "", and demanded that a JPC probe be ordered into the matter.Addressing a special party briefing, senior party spokesperson Anand Sharma and AICC's Communication department chief Randeep Surjewala said the CAG report tabled before the Gujarat Assembly on March 31 is a ""severe"" indictment of the then Modi government and depicted ""breach of trust, illegal enrichment of Suit Boot cronies and mal intentioned loss caused to public exchequer.

&gt; * ""The report unveils the ""stark truth"" as to how Rs 19,716 crore of hard-earned money of the people of Gujarat was ""squandered away"" by Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) under the watch of the then Chief Minister Modi, they said.

&gt; * The Prime Minister is not above the law,"" Sharma told reporters.The Opposition party indicated it may raise the issue to target the Prime Minister in the next session of Parliament.The party also showed a short video which contained some remarks of Modi on the gas project, his tweets targeting the UPA government over CAG reports and certain comments of then leaders of opposition Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj slamming Congress leaders for allegedly not honouring CAG reports.Sharma said: ""Since the indictment by CAG is serious and public money is involved, a JPC is all the more required.

&gt; * ""CAG has called into question state PSU Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation's investment of Rs 19,576 crore in its Krishna Godavari (KG) block project, saying ""future prospects"" of the block remain shrouded in ""uncertainty"".In 2005, Modi as Gujarat chief minister had announced that GSPC had struck 20 tcf gas in the KG basin block, named 'Deendayal block', where commercial production is yet to start.CAG has also painted a gloomy picture of GSPC's finances, as its borrowing stood at Rs 19,716 crore as of March 2015, a jump of 177 per cent since 2011.

And btw the entire topic is about private equity its hilarious you use an example of a global equity rally to make a point about private equity investment shows how little you know about the topic.

Both Indonesia and Brasil have significantly better environments to invest in. Their currencies are are more open, they have better rule of law, their capital markets are far more mature, better regulatory environment.  And most importantly better liquidity.
