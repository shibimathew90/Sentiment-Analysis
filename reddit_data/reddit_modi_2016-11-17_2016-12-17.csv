While I do hold him partly responsible for what happened, as it was his state, I don't believe what the English media in the country has been trying to shove down everyone's throats for the last few years. If anything, all that they have done is to convince me to give him the benefit of the doubt every time they start crying about something. They were all portraying him as the second Hitler, and as far as I can see all he's done so far is take a tougher stance on Islamic terrorism and Pakistan (which is a huge no-no to all the liberals for some reason), and now he's trying to go after the black and counterfeit money, which will take a while before we can really see it's effects. Done way more than the political party that was in power for 90% of the time since our independence. 

And most importantly he's united more of the country than anyone else. He's the only one that's so far addressed Indians as a whole, instead of Dalits, Hindus, Muslims, etc etc. Frankly I don't think there is anyone else that is even capable of doing a fraction of that in the opposition parties. 

Honestly, the way the english media in the country speaks of him, you expect him to eat babies and keep slaves locked up for his amusement and take over the country. And those JNU morons keep calling him Hitler. And the same media keeps giving them air time as if they have any credibility. If he was anywhere close to what they keep shouting he is, they would all be dead by now or locked up and never heard from again. Instead we're still dealing with them making a nuisance of themselves. They keep painting such a one sided picture and they're not even trying to hide their prejudices anymore. While everyone I talk to have the same hope that maybe we're finally moving in the right direction as a country(then again I could just be talking to like minded people). 

End of the day, the only thing that matters are the results. The Congress party spoke nice things and the media parroted it for decades and the country hasn't progressed. We have the highest number of people living below poverty line, highest number of people that starve to death every year. But the people who live in mansions keep talking about socialism and communism and the congress party, while all three have categorically failed the people of the country for decades over and over again. 

So I'm willing to swallow whatever grievances I have with the BJP and Modi, because it's time for some drastic changes from what we had to deal with the last few decades. For every one of us that is enjoying a middle class life, there are thousands more with without access to the most basic utilities and resources, because the opposition has utterly and completely failed and in fact turned it's back on the very people it was supposed to represent.

17,"&gt; Pms can be changed when they lose parliamentary majority. 

Presidents can be impeached.    

&gt; American presidents can veto congressional acts which require a supermajority to bypass.   

That's not even required in the Prime Ministerial System because their Party is the majority in the Lok Sabha - so stuff which they do not like will not be passed in the Lok Sabha - so the veto won't even be required. This is very different from the US presidential system where the PM can have both the House and the Senate from the Opposition Party - something like is not possible in the PM system. Which gives vastly less power to the Pres.   

&gt; They can nominate supreme court justices    

Our PM also appoints SC judges - http://www.livemint.com/Politics/qQer95iRsV7I9OglOzEOaJ/Govt-appoints-four-Supreme-Court-judges.html    

He also vetos - http://thewire.in/76841/modi-government-uses-pocket-veto-neutralise-primacy-sc-collegium/   

Not just that, the Pres in the US has lesser power in this because - the Congress has to approve. The SCOTUS has been one judge short for more than 6 months because the Congress is not approving Obama's nominee for the SCOTUS.   

The Presidential system does not seem to have any more executive power than the PM system.

26,"&gt; Presidents can be impeached.

Yup. They have to be impeached, in a long, cumbersome process. That is why till date, not a single one has been thrown out with this process, so far - johnson and clinton were impeached by the house but acquitted by senate, while nixon resigned before impeachment. That is three in over, what, 240 years now? Shall we count the number of our pms that resigned and the number that lost the vote of confindence in less than 70 years? 

&gt;their Party is the majority in the Lok Sabha - so stuff which they do not like will not be passed in the Lok Sabha 

Exactly. The **party** or the alliance in majority has to like the stuff, not just the pm. As for house and senate in opposition, yes, only when they both are, they can slow a president's **legislative** agenda down - they cannot interfere with his **executive** function. If our pm pisses off his party sufficiently, even the most sychophantic ones may develope spine to simply abstain when the opposition calls for a vote of confidence.


&gt;Our PM also appoints SC judges 

**Our governmet signs off on judges selected by the collegium**. Yes, they can, and have, hold up appointments for a while citing excuses, such as the ""memorandum of procedure"" being out of date, in your second link. The sc chief justice has called it a red herring. The mop in fact puts a timeline to be followed -  just read a few paragraphs starting with ""The existing MoP, followed since 1999, is clear on this:"" in your own second link. So what this amounts to is the pm using borderline gray areas arising out of the njac/collegium fight with sc to hold up judicial appointments. This is **not** an official veto. One modi can get away with it once, for a few years, but the sc will hopefully lay the rule of law before this goes too far.

Contrast this with us system, where the president selects a candidate for sc, and house and senate vote on it. In that system, fekuunkill can nominate babu bajarangis, maya kodnanis and amit shahs (and not even subramaniam swamis with litigation experience) one after another, and other politicians have the choice of watching the sc empty out if they want to hold up those appointments or appointing baboons. Watch trump. He'll show you how it is done. 

The current 9month impasse on obama's pick is because of a peculiar situation, and not a common occurance. As for both house and senate being in opposition, remember, despite all the drama of goverment shutdowns, he managed to armtwist the congress into passing the healthcare law (while feku had to wait for a long time to clear just one house of parliament for gst). That is only possible because he has big bargaining chips, thanks to the executive power.

Us presidential veto extends to any law passed by the congress. Not just sc appointments. Technically, Indian parliament can pass a private member's bill, and the president, not the pm, can at worst ask, ""are you sure you want to do this?"", and be told, ""yes"", to lay the matter to rest.

Edit:but this discussion here is more about why I am afraid of india having a presidential system. For RSS to have wet dreams about it, they only need to believe that one man can establish ramrajya, and that it will be one of their chaddiwalas. People who think injesting cow dung and piss is good for you don't need logical reasoning for supporting any belief.

Patna:  
  On a day when the opposition launched an offensive against the government over the abrupt withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, there was a rare exception. Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, expressed his ""total support"" for the ban, introduced last week by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.



In parliament, which began its winter session today, a cohort of other leaders he frequently leans on - including Mamata Banerjee - decried the ban on notes as a move that is punishing the poorest and weakest, who suddenly find themselves cashless.



""Fake notes will disappear,"" said Mr Kumar in his home state, sharing rare agreement with PM Modi, who has said the reform will attack the roots of black or untaxed money, counterfeited currency and corruption.



But eight days after the old notes were cancelled, with just a few hours' notice, banks are swarming with huge crowds desperate to get to the counter or an ATM to collect some new currency. A new version of the Rs 500 note is still a rarity; the 2000 rupee note is being rejected by many vendors who say they cannot provide change for the high-denomination bill.



Nearly 48 billion dollars have been deposited in banks so far, as people turn in the old notes. And though the lines at banks in cities are long, it is in villages that a crisis is threatened with lakhs who are excluded from the banking system.



The government has repeatedly said it is working night and day to reconfigure ATM machines, which need bigger trays to stock the new currency. The Reserve Bank of India has also confirmed that it has made special arrangements to help villages by dispatching micro-ATMs, which are like the machines used in shops to swipe credit cards and are carried to remote areas to dispense cash.



For now, people can exchange Rs 4,500 of old notes for new ones - after this swap, indelible ink is used on the customer to ensure it remains a one-time exchange; upto Rs 24,000 can be withdrawn per week from a bank account; Rs 4,500 can be withdrawn from an ATM per card per day.



In an all-day debate in parliament today, opposition leaders like Anand Sharma of the Congress said they are not opposed to the reform, but to what they described as the lack of preparation to manage the cash crunch. The government has emphasized that if the notice for the initiative had been longer, the move would not have been effective.

---

&gt;* To stop repeat money-exchangers thronging banks with invalid currency notes, banks have started applying indelible ink mark on the right index finger of customers in the select metro cities.

&gt;* As per a government statement, 11 branches of SBI are using the method to weed out customers queuing up repeatedly to exchange invalid currency notes.

&gt;* As per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for exchanging notes, bank branches and post offices concerned will use indelible ink before the new notes are given to the customer to allow the ink to dry up within a few seconds and prevent its removal.

&gt;* The move comes amid reports of long queues and chaotic scenes at banks and ATMs across the country for past several days since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced withdrawal of old Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes last week.

&gt;* Identified bank branches are provided with black indelible ink bottles of 5-ml each.

 By Iain Marlow and Bibhudatta Pradhan 

 

  Beneath a towering billboard of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s beaming face, Sainood Khan slaps together dung cakes she uses for cooking fuel.  

 

  Not much has changed for her family since Modi was elected in 2014. Despite his campaign promise to create jobs, she still works as a day laborer, while her husband pedals a rickshaw, together earning just $45 each month. The only improvement in their lives has been a gas canister in their kitchen, provided by the government, that they cannot afford to refill.  

 

  ""Except for the cooking gas, nothing has changed,"" said Khan, 30, as her four children played barefoot nearby, surrounded by sugarcane fields in Garhi village in rural Uttar Pradesh.  

 

  Halfway through his first term as India’s prime minister, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party have a mixed record in power. Growth is expected to be around 7.7 percent in the year through March and Modi passed a goods and services tax. There have been no major corruption scandals. India has momentum.  

 

  And yet for ordinary Indians like Khan, Modi’s successes have little meaning. After stiff opposition from lawmakers and unions, the prime minister abandoned efforts to reform land and labor laws that would dramatically improve the ease of doing business. And there is little employment growth. In early November, a decision to scrap India’s highest denomination bills, in order to fight tax evasion, resulted in chaos as millions lined up at banks to exchange worthless notes.  

 

  To his critics, the polarizing Hindu nationalist leader is also creating a more divided India.  

 

  ""There have been major success stories,"" said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.  

 

  ""At the same time, some of Modi’s most ballyhooed economic reform proposals fell flat, and the country has experienced very stark communal tensions and violence,"" he added, referring to attacks on religious minorities and lower castes.  

 

  As Modi faces more than a dozen state elections until the general election in 2019, the lack of progress on jobs could impact his Bharatiya Janata Party at the polls, while legislative defeats could setback further efforts to liberalize India’s economy and risk raising tensions in a country of 1.3 billion people.  

 

  Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office, didn’t answer a call or respond to text messages seeking comment on Modi’s reform record.  

 

 Gradual Reforms 

  In the 2014 election, Modi rode a wave of dissatisfaction with corruption and economic stagnation to India’s first parliamentary majority in 30 years.  

 

  With each budget, he liberalized more sectors for foreign investment. The government also introduced a bankruptcy law and created marketing campaigns to re-brand the country, such as the ""Make in India"" manufacturing push.  

 

  ""I believe Prime Minister Modi’s track record on reforms is brighter than he is generally given credit,"" said Richard Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in U.S. India Policy Studies at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.  

 

 Currency Move 

  On Nov. 8, Modi gathered his cabinet ministers in the colonial-era sandstone Secretariat Building in New Delhi. Insisting on complete secrecy, Modi told them of his surprise plans to abolish the 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, according to two people who were present but declined to be named citing rules.  

 

  Not one of the ministers asked a question, and all were barred from carrying their mobile phones to prevent leaks before Modi announced his reform on national television, these people said. It was an example of the extraordinary control Modi wields over his ministers.  

 

  Yet even as he consolidated power, Modi also had to abandon controversial reforms to laws governing how companies acquire land, as well as hire and fire workers.  

 

  ""There was a moment of time -- the first 12 months -- when the government could have acted more boldly,"" said Milan Vaishnav, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""But they decided that the political costs were too high.""  

 

  Despite the hype around Modi, India barely budged this year on the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings, coming 130 out of 190 countries.  

 

 ‘Anti-National’ 

  Under Modi, there has also been concern India is becoming more divided and less tolerant.  

 

  So-called ""cow protector"" vigilantes have begun attacking those suspected of harming cows, which Hindus consider sacred. Hindu nationalists have attacked and killed Muslims for allegedly eating beef, and even filmed themselves beating Dalits -- formerly known as untouchables -- for allegedly skinning a dead cow, a traditional occupation.  

 

  ""He’s deeply polarizing,"" said Harsh Mander, a New Delhi-based human rights activist who advised the previous Congress administration on social programs. ""That will be his lasting legacy, leaving India even more divided than it was when he came to power.""  

 

  Modi, accused of failing to put an end anti-Muslim riots in 2002 when he ruled Gujarat, has remained largely silent on recent violence. ""He’s very selective about his silence,"" said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, who wrote a biography of Modi.  

 

  He also kept quiet when a BJP politician crusaded against former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, who warned about growing intolerance. Modi only spoke about the matter after Rajan said he would not seek a second term.  

 

  Since Modi was elected, people who question India’s policies have been vilified as ""anti-national."" During student protests in Delhi, Rajnath Singh, India’s home minister, tweeted that anyone who shouts anti-India slogans ""will not be tolerated or spared."" The opposition Congress Party’s Rahul Gandhi, Modi’s rival in the 2014 elections, was detained by police twice in one day trying to meet the family of a veteran who killed himself over his pension.  

 

 Change on the Ground 

  It’s clear Modi is far from done with his attempts to change India.  

 

  Observers who doubted Modi had any reforms left were shocked by his move to abolish 86 percent of India’s circulated currency notes. It was typical Modi: Bold and polarizing. Supporters said it was visionary. Critics said the long queues and policy tweaks showed the government lacked a proper implementation plan and risked alienating small traders, who form the party’s base.  

 

  Meanwhile, many of Modi’s social initiatives remain distant promises: Villagers such as Khan, in Uttar Pradesh, still do not have the bank accounts or toilets promised by the government. ""If someone comes here and tells us, then we’ll apply,"" Khan says.  

 

  Modi, however, remains popular even to those who see little change. Shyamvir Singh, waiting with his sugarcane-laden bullock cart outside a factory in a town called Modinagar in Uttar Pradesh, said he hasn’t seen any benefit from Modi’s election. He doesn’t believe it’s possible to double farmer incomes by 2022, as Modi promised. But that won’t stop him voting for Modi again.  

 

  ""Even if I’m not getting benefits, it seems like other people are getting benefits,"" said Singh, 42.  

 

  Before his term ends, Modi must focus on restoring social harmony and ensuring his numerous social initiatives are actually implemented across India, said New Delhi-based political commentator Arati Jerath, who has written about Indian politics for about four decades.  

 

  ""Time is running out,” Jerath said, noting Modi must create jobs and have a meaningful impact on people’s lives before he starts campaigning for the 2019 election. ""These are the biggest challenges. If he is unable to do this, he will be in serious trouble.""

  Mihir Sharma | Bloomberg  

 (This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners) 

 

  One week after India’s sudden declaration that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes were no longer legal tender, the economy is in chaos. And that’s perhaps because the policy was designed as much to shock and awe observers with the government’s command of the Indian economy as to control India’s “black money” problem. What seemed at first to be a masterstroke by Prime Minister Narendra Modi now looks like a grave miscalculation.  

 

 India's Aspirations 

  Modi is beginning to sound like he may agree. His recent speeches on the subject have been frankly bizarre. In one, he seemed to laugh at those inconvenienced by the ban; in another, he broke down while speaking of the “sacrifices” he'd made for India, and warned that he might be assassinated by “forces” desperate to protect their “loot.""  

 

  What’s changed in a week? Well, for one, it’s become clear that the government was simply too cavalier in its planning. Now that 86 percent of India’s currency is no longer valid, the central bank has struggled to print replacement denominations -- and the new notes are the wrong size for existing ATMs. Modi’s asked people to be patient for 50 days, but the process could take as long as four months.  

 

  You have to wonder if Modi truly sought expert advice, or relied once again on a small and trusted set of politicians to determine policy. India’s simply too big and complex for shock and awe. Large parts of the rural economy use cash for 80 percent of transactions and have been hard-hit. In seafood-mad West Bengal, for example, the fishing industry is in a state of near-collapse; in the wheat-growing states of the northwest, farmers halfway through the sowing season have run out of cash to buy seeds.  

 

  Few villagers have access to an ATM. Most have to trek to a bank branch to change their cash, which means losing out on crucial days of labor. Many Indians, particularly women, still don’t have an active bank account. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wondered aloud how many poor people would even have 1,000-rupee notes -- probably a rhetorical question, but surely it shouldn’t have been. Someone should've sought the answer before shutting down India’s financial system.  

 

  Among India’s middle class, Modi’s “surgical strike on black money” still appears to be popular. It’s the old “vegan fallacy” -- if something tastes terrible, it must be good for you. Enough Indians are suffering that they believe it must be in a greater cause. It’s a moral project, not an economic one. Stand in line, we’re told, and you honor our brave soldiers at the border.  

 

  But will that support last? The government’s plan is likely to be ineffective in the long term. Economists agree it will have no effect on the generation of black money through corruption.  

 

  Meanwhile, estimates of the amount of black money that will eventually be recovered vary widely. The optimists (wrongly) think enough cash will be destroyed by hoarders that the central bank will be able to pay a hefty dividend to the government. Others point out that a very small fraction of black money tends to be held as cash and that there are a dozen ways still available to launder that fraction. The government has largely failed to close these loopholes. Worse, rumors of the demonetization were reportedly circulating before Modi’s announcement, leading to suspicions that the well-connected may have had time to dump their cash piles.  

 

 India's Scramble to Switch 23 Billion Banknotes 

  Even in the best case scenario -- that a significant proportion of the outstanding currency is destroyed -- there’s no reason to suppose it was all black money and not the savings of regular citizens scared of harassment by tax authorities. Modi has dropped dark hints that this is just the beginning, raising fears that business should now worry about of constant tax raids and the reopening of decades-old cases. In fact, that dark new age may already be here.  

 

  Even setting aside the painful adjustment, the long-term effects of this monetary shock on India’s informal economy could well be severe; a large proportion of marginal firms may not survive the loss of a fortnight of income. The informal financial sector -- unregistered moneylenders who provide loans to businesses worth 40 percent of total bank lending -- will be decimated.  

 

  The costs to the government could be equally high. Modi's administration has put political considerations over economic detail once too often -- and this time, it's severely dented its image for efficiency and practicality. Even if the long queues vanish in the next few weeks, that damage to the government’s reputation is permanent.

When RBI hands over seigniorage to the Central government, it shows up in the government’s bank account at the RBI itself. Photo: PTI



There is a meme circulating that the government will reap a kind of windfall gain from its monetary coup d’état. To the extent that some portion of these notes will remain unexchanged by the deadline, the argument goes, these notes will stand cancelled as liabilities of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). With its liabilities thus reduced, the RBI can afford to fork over more surplus, known as seigniorage, to the government as a one-time bonanza.



This argument is based on a misreading of the central bank’s balance sheet. Currency notes are not the same thing as having a checking account with the central bank. Seigniorage is paid out of the RBI’s income flow but cancellation of currency notes changes only its net worth. Conflating both income and value as well as currency and credit can have seriously monetary consequences.



How does the RBI or any central bank make money? At one level, the same way any regular bank makes money: it borrows short and lends long, making the “spread” between borrowing and lending. Unlike a regular bank, however, a central bank is the government’s bank, having sovereign capital not financial capital.



Look at RBI’s latest balance sheet. Abstracting a bit, its liabilities are the deposit accounts that commercial banks have with RBI plus currency notes, comprising 16% and 53% of its liabilities, respectively, according to this year’s statement. And the assets? In the main, central banks hold bonds and a bit of vestigial gold. In emerging markets, central banks tend to hold a combination of domestic bonds and foreign-currency bonds. RBI has 93% of its assets in bonds, (22% domestic plus 71% foreign) and an ornamental 4% in gold.



Interest payments from both domestic and foreign-currency bonds comprise RBI’s actual cash income. RBI’s balance sheet also moves up and down in net worth depending on the market value of these bonds, the bulk of which are foreign-currency bonds.



What is interesting is that the vast majority of the RBI’s assets are now foreign-currency bonds earning them an interest payment in foreign exchange. These foreign bonds represent the nation’s foreign exchange reserves. Because India is a net importer on trade account, it is a net borrower on capital account. So these reserves are not savings so much as borrowed reserves, a bulwark to protect the nation from its fragile external position.



Also note that, given the low interest-rate environment globally with quantitative easing, most of RBI’s cash income at present comes from interest on domestic bonds rather than foreign bonds; the situation was the reverse before the crisis. This is even though most of its net worth in absolute terms comes from the value of its foreign bonds, which form the majority of its asset-holding.



So we can see where the profit comes from. Like all central banks in normal times, RBI does not pay interest to the commercial banks for their deposits (which represent their cash reserve requirement or CRR). And cash, currency in circulation, is basically a zero-coupon, perpetual bearer-bond; unlike other IOUs, cash does not yield an interest payment to the bearer.



RBI’s liabilities are interest-free whereas its assets are interest-yielding. This spread between interest-free liabilities and interest-bearing assets is the source of the RBI’s income, which is tax-free by law. This is where seigniorage comes from. A portion of this cash income is credited to the government after deducting running expenses and various reserves.



Seigniorage is a very small share of the RBI’s net worth (about 6%) but a substantial share of its cash income, almost 100% at this juncture. Either way, seigniorage is always paid out of an actual income flow rather than notional valuation changes in net worth.



Recall that about 70% of the RBI’s liabilities are in the form of commercial bank deposits (16%) and currency notes (53%). The balance 30% on the liability-side comprises an item called “Other Liabilities and Provisions” which is basically a balancing entry representing the spread, the difference between the RBI’s assets and liabilities. Seigniorage transfers to the government are booked as a part of this balancing provision on the liabilities side even though their source is actual income flow.



By far the largest item in this provision is held under the heading of “Currency and Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA)”. This is where “unrealized gains/losses on valuation of foreign currency assets (FCA)” are parked.



This CGRA account, representing 30% of the net worth, is there for a good reason. Because RBI’s foreign-bond assets fluctuate with movements in the rupee, RBI could at any point be in the black or the red viz. its FCA holdings. When the rupee strengthens, RBI’s takes a loss on its FCA and its balance sheet shrinks, and vice-versa. This fluctuation in the balance sheet requires a buffer, which is the CGRA account.



The bottom line is that seigniorage is paid from income flow not liquidation of the balance sheet. The difference in assets and liabilities is kept as a buffer against rupee movements. This buffer is only a liquid resource for seigniorage if bonds are actually sold at a profit. The size of the buffer (the CGRA account) represents a policy choice on the part of the RBI in choosing how to deal with rupee fluctuations in the context of “borrowed reserves”.



Now, where’s the bonanza? Assuming that it’s the relatively rich whose money would stand cancelled after the demonetization deadline, and further assuming that the government would spend the resulting bonanza on the relatively poor, the government’s monetary coup would amount to a expropriation of the rich in favour of the poor. Socialists should rejoice.



Yet this is a misreading of the situation based on a kind of literalism. Yes, currency is RBI’s liability (“I promise to pay the bearer the sum of...”), and in literal terms, a reduction in one’s liability is a gain. But cash is no ordinary asset, and the central bank’s no ordinary balance sheet.



We live in a world of “inside money” not fiat money. Money has value not because of sovereign fiat but because, through central banking and sovereign debt, it is a promise to pay a slice of (domestic or foreign) gross domestic product. The universalization of inside money means that the asset used as a final means of settlement is just some institution’s liability.



Thus in exchange, central bank money is just a promise to pay itself. In normal times, go to RBI and try and get it to discharge its “liability” to you, and you will just get another note in return. This is not normal liability. The normal rules don’t apply.



This circularity is also expressed in the fact that the central bank is where the government itself banks. So when RBI hands over seigniorage to the Central government, it shows up in the Central government’s bank account at the RBI itself. That is, it just moves from one line on the liabilities side to another. It remains the liability of the RBI until the government spends it.



Once seigniorage is spent, it will either take the form of someone’s income as a bank deposit or cash. Thus either the balance sheet of the banking system will expand, leading to more CRR deposits at the central bank, and over time, more cash will have to be printed. Either operation would again expand the liabilities side of the RBI. In other words, any contraction in the RBI’s liabilities might be reversed once the extra seigniorage gets spent. What looks like a one-time bonanza could just be a temporary fluctuation on the central bank’s balance sheet.



Further, the literalism of this account treats



all items on the central bank’s liability-side as



if they were qualitatively the same thing. It is



as if currency in circulation is the same thing



as having a checking account with the RBI.



Both appear as line-items on the liabilities side after all!



Yet patently, physical cash is not the same thing as a checking account with a central bank.



Recall that seigniorage is paid out of actual cash income from interest payments. In the past few years, virtually all RBI’s interest income (mainly domestic since the crisis) has been paid out in seigniorage. The “cancellation” of some currency notes would increase the net worth of the RBI but not its cash income that comes from interest payments and out of which seigniorage is paid. This bump in net worth would allow it to book more to the balancing provision in the CGRA account or indeed to the government’s own deposit account with the RBI. However, there is a difference in the source of this extra seigniorage.



Cancelled currency is not cash income in the same way that interest on bond is income: the latter is actual cash flow. So in the “bonanza” scenario, the extra would not be paid out of any extra cash flow but out of a change in the value of the stock of liabilities. This amounts to the creation of new high-powered money or, in layman’s terms, “printing money”.

Say that your labour force is increasing by about 2 percentage points(this is not the same as population growth since the people entering the workforce *today* were born 20 years ago or so, when India's TFR was higher than it is in 2015).

If you are growing at 7.6%, what is your needed employment elasticity? Well, that is easy division. 7.6/2= 3.8. Then you take 1/3.8= **0.26** &lt;-- employment elasticity required at 7.6% GDP growth. 

So your employment elasticity has to be at least 0.26 just to clear the *incoming* labour force entrants. The 2011 census showed that India already has 47 million unemployed. So in effect, you need a higher number just to clear the backlog.

What is India's employment elasticity? [Close to zero](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/zAcuIvXlzIfML7N2Q10L2H/Employment-elasticity-almost-zero.html).

The problem of jobless growth has haunted India for many years, but what is worrying is that it seems to have accelerated. Modi has claimed that there is a huge upsurge of employment through mudra bank lending in the unorganised sector. Needless to say, this is spin.

India is growing fast, but it is not creating any jobs. Worse, the jobs that are being created are increasingly concentrated in the high-end service sector. FDI into manufacturing has not been as robust as it has been in services sector. A lot of FDI is in reality not so-called ""greenfield"" investment but take-overs like the Essar Oil deal or Vodafone pumping in billions of USD through equity injections. Genuine FDI/Greenfield investment is much lower, and concentrated in sectors where India already has an advantage and where the skill thresholds are high.

What does all this mean for India? To my mind, the only solution is that there will be somekind of UBI scheme implemented. The middle classes will not enjoy being the economic engine that everyone else depends on, but it seems this is the future. Combine this with worsening pollution and population, and it is not unfathomable that India will see even greater levels of emigration of smart/educated citizens. In a post-Trump/Brexit world, where will they go? Canada and Australia are much smaller countries.  ",2016-11-17 11:03:35

(Representational image)

A 78-year-old man, who had come to deposit cash at a state-run bank Hyderabad died today after allegedly suffering a heart attack, police said. Laxman Rao, a retired government employee, came alone to the Marredpally branch to deposit Rs 1.5 lakh this morning and stood in the queue at the entrance of the bank, they said.

“He collapsed on the bank’s entrance steps and the policemen on duty immediately shifted him to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him brought dead,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (North Zone) B Sumathi told PTI.

“He died of heart-ailment… He had once suffered a heart attack and had been operated upon,” the DCP said based on preliminary investigation. Rao was a native of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh.

Another police officer, who was on duty at the bank when the elderly man collapsed on the steps, said: “Though there were large number of people at the bank, separate queues were made for depositing and exchanging currency. He waited in the queue for around 30 minutes.”

“After seeing him collapse on the steps, I got him shifted in an auto-rickshaw and later in an ambulance to a hospital, but he died,” the police officer said.

___

The government has issued instructions to the private hospitals to accept cheques in case a patient cannot pay by card. The government has issued instructions to the private hospitals to accept cheques in case a patient cannot pay by card.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock ban on high-value banknotes will hit the war chests of his rivals before a key state election next year, sparking accusations that his strike against “black cash” will unfairly boost his party’s chances. That is despite widespread anger among millions of Indians forced to queue outside banks to change small amounts of old money for legal tender, possibly denting support for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at least in the short term.

Opposition politicians are scrambling to redraft campaign plans ahead of the ballot expected early next year in Uttar Pradesh, a state of more than 200 million people which will be crucial to Modi’s long-term plan for re-election in 2019.

The prime minister last week outlawed 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in a drive to rein in corruption and a shadow economy that accounts for a fifth of India’s $2.1 trillion gross domestic product.

With no state election funding, illicit cash is the lifeblood for political parties that collect money from candidates and businessmen, and then spend it to stage rallies, hire helicopters and hand out “gifts” to win votes.

Spending on the Uttar Pradesh election is forecast to hit a record 40 billion rupees ($590 million), despite the cancellation of big notes.

MIXED REVIEWS

Modi’s demonetisation drive has so far proven popular among increasingly aspirational voters who are tired of corruption, although views among the broader population and economists are divided over the efficacy and fairness of the move.

Opposition politicians have united to decry it.

“We will have to plan the entire election strategy all over again,” said Pradeep Mathur, a senior Uttar Pradesh leader of the Congress opposition party that was trounced by the BJP in 2014 national elections.

His concerns reflect a view that the BJP, with more members than its rivals and close ties to big corporate donors, can survive the cash crunch better, helping Modi win Uttar Pradesh and four other territories heading to the polls early in 2017.

For Modi, winning India’s main battleground state is vital to strengthen his party’s position in the upper house of parliament, where it is still in the minority, before seeking a second term in the 2019 general election.

“Their calculation is that this is going to hurt everybody, but in relative terms the BJP is going to come out stronger,” said Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.

According to the Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies (CMS), which tracks campaign financing, the BJP relies on cash for less than two-thirds of its funding in a state like Uttar Pradesh.

Its regional rivals use cash to cover 80 to 95 percent of campaign spending.

SCALING BACK

Demonetisation will force Congress to hold smaller rallies, said Mathur, and there will be fewer “freebies” for voters.

Other parties are also adjusting plans in Uttar Pradesh. Ashok Agarwal, a politician with the incumbent Samajwadi Party in the city of Mathura, will have to rely more on his team of 1,000 volunteers to connect with voters.

In a bid to limit the squeeze, parties are paying workers to queue at banks and swap old notes for new ones and evade scrutiny from tax inspectors, said party activists in Mathura.

Event managers, whose businesses usually boom at election time, are worried.

“No political party except the BJP wants to organise big rallies before January. All of them depend on cash,” said Rajesh Pratap, who has provided loudspeakers, outdoor air conditioners and security to party rallies for over a decade.

Mayawati, a powerful former leader of Uttar Pradesh who Modi’s aides view as his biggest electoral threat in the state, says the demonetisation timing appeared highly political. BJP officials accuse Mayawati of hoarding “black” money garnered from selling tickets to candidates to fund her campaign.

One senior official and a close aide to Mayawati said some of her party’s rallies would be axed and replaced by more door-to-door campaigning.

“Last month … we had to bring over 300,000 villagers from across UP (Uttar Pradesh) to Lucknow city for a day … It’s not just us, but every political party spends money at grassroots level to win votes,” the official said.

Modi has not explicitly linked demonetisation to a clean-up of electoral funding, but officials in his party say rivals should have heeded his warnings earlier this year that he was serious about clamping down on “black” cash.

“You cannot call it a bolt from the blue because Modi … had dropped sufficient hints that he will take strict action,” said a close aide.

“MOTHER OF ALL CORRUPTION”

While an immediate liquidity crunch for parties is clear, the longer-term impact on funding is less so.

The symbiosis between businessmen seeking favours and parties needing cash has sent campaign funding soaring.

In southern Andhra Pradesh state, three in four voters reported receiving money from parties during the last general election, according to research by CMS.

The group’s chairman N. Bhaskara Rao describes electoral corruption as “the mother of all corruption” in India.

In the 2014 election, when Modi swept to power with an electrifying campaign that included 3D holograms of him giving speeches in villages across India, parties spent a record 370 billion rupees ($5.4 billion), CMS estimated.

They have also long circumvented rules and learned to avoid using cash – parties get donors to acquire equipment for rallies directly, or local traders to buy gifts for would-be voters, such as mobile phone credits.

By Anirban Nag and Anto Antony






  From keeping Indian defense jets on the ready to transfer cash from mints, to banks knocking on the doors of religious institutions to access smaller change, Indian ingenuity is being stretched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cash ban to crackdown on unaccounted money.
  





  India's cash economy has been thrown into turmoil since Modi announced last week that 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would cease to be legal tender and would have to be deposited at banks by year-end, leaving about one-seventh of currency in circulation. Economists say the move will be beneficial in the long-run as it is targeted at weeding out tax evasion and corruption. Unaccounted money makes up nearly a fourth of the economy. In the short-term though, the biggest crackdown on money laundering in India's history is having some unusual side-effects. Here are some unintended consequences.

Defense Jets



  Indian defense jets are on standby to airlift cash from mints across India to remote corners of the country. ""Depending on urgency, security and non-availability of commercial aircraft, requests for support from the Indian Air Force is within standing procedures,"" a spokeswoman for Reserve Bank of India said.
  





  Currency notes are usually transported from printing presses owned by the central bank to some 4,000 vaults around the country and then to bank branches in specially-built trucks with gunners for security. Since the crackdown, new currency bills have had to be airlifted by helicopter from Patna after reports of shortage in Bokaro and Jamshedpur, a finance ministry official said.
  





Rolex Demand



  There was a surge in demand for luxury watches after Modi's sudden announcement as wealthy Indians rushed to make costly purchases with unaccounted cash. One luxury watch outlet in north-west Mumbai saw 45 units of Rolex watches sold on a single day, according to a representative of a watchmaker, who was present when the sales took place. Demand matched what the shop would usually sell in a month and the store had to turn away customers, the person said, asking not to be identified because the person is not authorized to speak to the media.
  





Gold Rush



  A new gold rush also emerged soon after Modi's announcement. ""Jewelers who had shut shop for the day on Nov. 8 had to reopen their stores within a couple of hours and were selling gold up to 4 a.m.,"" Chirag Thakkar, a director at gold wholesaler Amrapali Group, said by phone from Ahmedabad in Modi's home state of Gujarat. ""Customers were lining up with bags of cash. Some jewelers even had to call the police to organize the crowds."" Customers paid as much as 52,000 rupees per 10 grams, almost double the current prices, he said.
  





Retirees Return



  State-run banks have called retired employees to man new makeshift counters where the banned currency notes are being exchanged for new ones. Bank employees have been working long hours without breaks to ease the transition and the government has told lenders to provide them with transportation and food, All India Bank Employees' Association General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said by phone.
  





Trucks Abandoned



  About half of an estimated 9.3 million trucks under the All India Motor Transport Congress were off the road eight days after the announcement as drivers abandoned vehicles mid-way into their trips after running out of cash, according to Naveen Gupta, secretary general of the group. India's roads carry about 65 percent of the country's freight. Drivers don't have enough money for food, truck maintenance and to make payments at border check posts. ""It will take a few more days for the situation to normalize,"" Gupta said in an e-mailed statement.
  





Cash Machines



  Compounding the problem of pumping new money into the system is the need to reconfigure the country's 220,000 cash machines so that they can dispense the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes, which do not fit into existing ATM cash trays, according to Navroze Dastur, the managing director for India and South Asia at NCR Corp., which supplies about two-thirds of the country's machines. Dastur said it will take as much as a month to adjust all the ATMs.
  





Free Coffee



  In Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, Starbucks Corp. has been serving free coffee to people waiting for many hours in queues in front of ATMs and banks, a spokesman for the company said.
  





Turning to Religion



  India's religious institutions are opening up their donation boxes to help people meet their day-to-day needs. Martin De Porres church in the Ernakulam district of Kerala, a south Indian state, decided to open its donation boxes after seeing the public's suffering, Jimmy Poochakkatt, the parish priest, told India Today magazine. Shree Dharma Shastha Mahavishnu Temple in Mumbai also opened its offering box, Raghunath Raghavan, president of the temple trust said by phone. Lenders are also reaching out to religious places to ask them to deposit funds given by devotees to bring currency back in circulation and ease the shortage, according to a statement from the Finance Ministry.

Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee at the rally in Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee at the rally in Delhi

Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal denounced the Narendra Modi-led Centre in fiery speeches at a protest rally in Azadpur Mandi, Delhi on Thursday. Both leaders targeted the government for its decision to withdraw currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 from circulation. They threatened to intensify their agitation if the government did not roll-back its decision to discontinue old currency notes in three days.

Daring the government to send those protesting against the move to jail, Banerjee said the fight will continue till the move was scrapped. “If you have courage, send us to jail or shoot us…But we will continue fighting,” she said. Accusing the government of trying to sell the country, Banerjee called the prevailing situation worse than the 1975 emergency. “They want to sell this country. They are trying to break the constitution. We cannot allow that,” the TMC chief said at the rally.

Kejriwal, speaking after Banerjee, took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly and accused him of helping liquor baron Vijay Mallya flee the country. He said while common people are standing in queues outside banks and ATMs, Mallya was enjoying in London.

The Delhi chief minister also assailed the government over the number of deaths of people while trying to exchange old currency notes. “Marriages are being broken and people are killing themselves…Who is responsible for their deaths?” Kejriwal thundered into the microphone.

She submitted a memorandum to President Pranaba Mukherjee and sought his intervention on the issue. TMC MPs will move an adjournment motion in the House on Thursday, Banerjee said. Kejriwal, however, skipped the protest march as he did not want to be seen with the Shiv Sena, sources told The Indian Express. Kejriwal did send his representative, with suspended Punjab MP Bhagwant Mann joining the march.

Updated Nov. 16, 2016 2:40 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS

Narendra Modi’s abrupt Nov. 8 decision to make nearly 90% of India’s cash unusable continues to cause huge disruption to the economy, inspiring protests against the Prime Minister. He insists the sudden demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes (worth $7.40 and $14.80) is necessary to fight “black money,” the fruits of corruption and crime. But by failing to cut taxes and deregulate first, he is curtailing economic freedom.

It’s not just bad guys who hold large amounts of cash in India. The informal or underground economy comprises an estimated 45% of GDP and employs 80% of the workforce. These enterprises can’t afford to comply with onerous government regulations, so they carry out all transactions in cash, even though their activities are otherwise legal. Informal lenders who finance such businesses also hold large amounts of cash.

Underground activity continues to grow faster than the economy as a whole. In an interview with Bloomberg a year ago, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley called himself a “great supporter” of the technically illegal enterprises. “The informal sector generates more jobs than the organized industry,” he said.

Yet Mr. Modi seems to have underestimated the extent to which his money swap would hurt these businessmen, along with their employees and customers. A week after the switch, Indians are still standing in long lines at the bank to convert their banknotes instead of working.

Because the old bills were demonitized immediately, the government had to maintain secrecy ahead of the announcement. That meant the new banknotes weren’t printed in advance, and ATM machines weren’t recalibrated. Mr. Modi asks for patience during the 50-day adjustment period. But this is no small hardship for the millions of Indians who live hand-to-mouth.

Meanwhile the real criminals can pay runners to convert their cash, which is only a small part of their haul. Corrupt officials and big crime syndicates launder their illicit earnings into gold, real estate and offshore bank accounts. The government expects to reap a $45 billion windfall from cash that is not exchanged, but that by itself will do little to curtail future crimes.

Mr. Modi says he will push Indians to use banks and electronic payment systems for more transactions, and there are fears the government could demonetize large bills again. So criminals will hold less cash, and informal businesses will be starved of liquidity.

A better way to tackle corruption would be to eliminate unnecessary regulations that give officials the arbitrary power needed to solicit bribes. Likewise reform of the tax code to cut rates and eliminate loopholes would reduce the opportunities and incentives for tax evasion. Then the fight against corruption wouldn’t need to harm the poor.

Cash is vital to the Indian economy because it allows people to escape the crushing weight of state bureaucracy. Reduced reliance on cash could be a useful indicator that Mr. Modi’s reforms are succeeding. But punishing Indians for their rational preferences will only backfire economically and politically.

96,"&gt;Hindus &amp; Muslims have lived together peaceful for centuries, 

I never stated otherwise. How is it relevant to Aurangazeb being a bigot?


&gt;Akbar the King was a secularlist

He was.

&gt;in contrast Aurangzeb has been castigated as a religious Muslim who was anti-Hindu, who taxed them, who tried to convert them, who discriminated against them in awarding high administrative positions, and who interfered in their religious matters. 

He did all of this.

I literally gave you the years and the laws he passed which did ALL of this.

Let me repeat it for you,

* In 1665, Hindus were banned from lighting lamps during Diwali - **Interfering in religious matters**

* In 1668  he prohibited construction of Hindu temples as well as the repair of old ones- **If not outright destroying temples, this is close enough**

*  In 1671, he issued an order that only Muslims could be landlords of the crown lands (reversal of mansabdari put in place by Akbar) - **Discriminating against high administrative positions**

* In 1672 he dismissed all Hindu clerks in the Mughal administration.- **Discrimination in low administrative positions**

* I think it was 1672 not sure of the year, when he outlawed singing and music...remind you of someone? The Taliban? ISIS?- **Wherever this might fit into**

* In 1674,  lands held by Hindus in Gujarat and Rajasthan were confiscated. The same year, the customs duties levied was doubled for non-Muslims.- **Taxing them heavily...double even**

* In 1679, Jizyah!- **Religious discrimination**

Since you persist, let me give you some more info,

* In his civil war against Dara, his constant stance was that Dara was not a Muslim and he was the true guardian of the faith, his actions sure bear this out,

* In 1669 he ordered the destruction of a famous (the name escapes me now) temple and 10 other temples in Delhi,

* In 1670 he ordered the destruction of both the Kashi Vishwanathh temple in Varanasi and the Somnath temple (must have been pretty run down by now, given that 3 Muslim invaders had destroyed it prior to this) to be destroyed,

* In 1669 he had (prior to his temple destruction spree) issued a firman that asked for Hindu schools to be demolished,

* In 1671 iirc he issued a firman that banned public worship for non Muslims,

* In 1678, he ordered the destruction of the Kesava Deo temple and erected a Mosque in its place, this had a particular hatred for Alamgir as Jahangir had patronised the temple and later Dara Shikoh was said to have patronised it as well as maybe even prayed in it. Oh, he didn't just destroy the temple, the idols were then made part of the foundation of the steps to the Mosque so you know...people would walk on it all the time,

* During the Rajput rebellion wars, he destroyed on his own count some 500 temples in Rajasthan, and classy that he was, it is estimated that some 100 carts took these idols back to Delhi and buried in the steps of various mosques. #Alamgirkeepingitreal,

* At some point he wanted to destroy the Puri temple, but thankfully for the Jaganath of Puri, the Marathas managed to push back an invasion into deep Orissa and thus saved the temple from certian death, or else the Jaganath would also have joined his colleagues on the steps of some Mosque in Delhi,

I think you get the point, As a bonus, in 1689 iirc he also for the lulz slaughtered cows in side Temple premises in many temples across his empire. The temples were safe, but you know, for teh lulz let us slaughter some cows, funny amirite? 

Aside from all this, moving away from the policy of tolerance of his forebearers as well as magnanimity (Akbar sent iirc 10 emissaries of peace to Rana Pratap, though he could have crushed him easily if he so desired), he restarted the gory practice of torture (mostly death by impalement) and tortured till death Sikh gurus, Sambhaji and a whole host of others...even his brother wasn't spared the torture. He loved his father so much that he gave him a paupers burial in the Taj complex...he wasn't even present for it and it was done at midnight.

Here is a direct quote from the tolerant man himself,

&gt;&gt; To even look at a temple is a sin in the eyes of Allah.

 I could maybe fill 2 10k posts just with his bigoted firmans, but if you don't change your mind with these, you won't change your mind with anything.

The only Alexander Hamilton I know (aside from the US one) is a pirate who was Scottish. Not that it is relevant given the laws I just quoted, but can you source it please?

&gt;The famous Indian historian Dr. Bishambhar Nath Pande said“If Aurangzeb had the intention of demolishing temples to make way for mosques, there would not have been a single temple standing erect in India.

This is as ridiculous as saying, if Hitler had his way, not a single Jew will be left alive - both tried, but the enormity of the task and the time available to them made it such that it was not possible.

&gt;On the contrary, Aurangzeb donated huge estates for use as temple sites and support thereof in Benares, Kashmir and elsewhere. The official documentations for these land grants are still extant.”

Which are these and source?

&gt; The proof of Aurangzeb’s land grant for famous Hindu religious sites in Kasi, Varanasi can easily be verified from the deed records extant at those sites

So he destroys all the famous temples in these sites, buries their idols in steps, some of these temples he converts to Mosques, but sanctions some random temple in their stead it is fine?

If Modi destroys Jamma Masjid and the top 5 mosques in the country, but sanctions 1000 sq meters to build a mosque in Delhi as compensation, would you call him tolerant?

&gt;Now let us deal with Aurangzeb’s imposition ofthe jizya tax which had drawn severe criticism from many Hindu historians. It is true that jizya was lifted during the reign of Akbar and Jahangir and that Aurangzeb later reinstated this. Before I delve into the subject of Aurangzeb’s jizya tax, or taxing the non-Muslims, it is worthwhile to point out that jizya is nothing more than a war tax which was collected only from able-bodied young non-Muslim male citizens living in a Muslim country who did not want to volunteer for the defense of the country.

I know how Jizya works, I can provide you exact Jizya and Zakat rates for a wide range of Islamic Caliphates even if you like...from memory.

In India's case, this is utter bollocks as Hindu men were pressganged to join the army. Second, we have actual data to show that he DOUBLED the taxes paid by Hindu merchants as opposed to Muslim merchants. Even the Jizya (however you spell it) was twice that of the Zakat (tithe) that Muslims were expected to pay.

The only concession that can be granted to him here is that he at least layered it and did not apply one flat tax. The wealthy had to pay Rs 48 / the middle class Rs 24 / the poor Rs 12. However, he must have been a crony capitalist because the tax percentages for the rich are lower than that of the poor. Anybody with a net wealth of Rs 200 was considered poor (the effective tax rate was 6%), the rich was anybody with 10k and above was poor hence the effective tax rate was a rounding error for them. However he did stiff them with double the merchant taxes so this is over and above that. The Zakat was at 2.75%. So if you were poor or middle class, you were paying more than twice or twice the tax rate paid by a Muslim. If you were rich, you paid twice the merchant taxes+some small amounts as Jizyah!

Again, he was a fair bigot - Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, Jains...all had to pay it. He was even fair to the Islamic apostates (the Shiites, Ahamadiays, Sufi etc) as he exempted them from paying this as if they were an apostate, they were to be executed or they accept Sunni Islam. 

This is just the Jizya mind you, over and above the revenue sharing that each peasant tiller was liable to pay to his Zamindar. It is estimated that the average tax rates were around 50% for the poor.

&gt;That is, no such tax was collected from non-Muslims who volunteered to defend the country. 

That is what the Book (Quran) says, that is what the good Caliphs like Umar followed, but not what Aurangazeb did. So your info is...again, false and horribly incorrect.

97,"#Adani, Ambani knew of cash scrap, says Rajasthan BJP MLA Bhawani Singh Rajawat

___

BJP MLA from Ladpura in Rajasthan’s Kota district Bhawani Singh Rajawat has purportedly claimed that “Ambani and Adani” had prior knowledge of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, as shown in a video released online on Wednesday.

“Adani, Ambani atram-satram in sab ko pehle hi pata thha. Inko hint de diya gaya. Unhone apna kar liya (Adani, Ambani and others knew it beforehand. They had been given a hint and they made arrangements accordingly),” Rajawat purportedly said in the video.

Watch What Else Is making News

Rajawat told The Indian Express later in the evening that it was an “off-record” bit of conversation with “some journalists” and alleged that they are presenting “distorted comments”.

“I did not say any of those things being shown in the video,” he claimed.

About the quality of new currency notes, which have attracted criticism from some quarters, Rajawat allegedly said in the tape, “The new currency note is third class. It feels counterfeit.”

Critical of the sudden announcement by PM Narendra Modi and implementation that has seen long queues outside banks and ATM kiosks, the BJP MLA purportedly said, “Poori currency aap print karte. Desh ki abadi aur uske anupat mein currency print karte, uske baad mein aap ek saath.ab petrol pump ki keematon ki tarah aaj 12 baje 500 aur 1000 ka note band ho jayega. (First you should have printed the new currency as per requirement. But like announcements of change in petrol prices, you announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 are invalid from midnight).”

Denying the conversation, Rajawat told The Indian Express, “Some journalists… came to my Kota home today for a bite on demonetisation, as I had visited villages in my constituency on Tuesday. But unethically they recorded an off-record conversation.”

99,"#Oil wars: How Russia's $13 billion Indian refinery deal almost fell apart

___

[IMAGE](http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-08/09/full/1470734941-4217.jpg)

___

A multi-billion-dollar Russian deal to buy Indian refiner Essar was nearly sunk at the eleventh hour by a rival bid from as the two oil superpowers vie for supremacy across the world.

The deal between Essar and a consortium led by Kremlin oil giant Rosneft appeared dead in the water two months ago after Saudi state energy firm Aramco weighed in, according to seven Russia, and Saudi-based industry sources familiar with or involved in the negotiations.

It was salvaged due to the involvement of Russian President and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who were keen for it go through, and after the consortium agreed to pay $13 billion - more than double what Rosneft had initially valued Essar at, sources told Reuters.

This made the refiner the biggest-ever foreign acquisition in and Russia's largest outbound deal.

The tussle for Essar - a state-of-the-art plant in the world's fastest-growing fuel market - illustrates the growing battle for oil markets between and Saudi Arabia, the world's two largest crude exporters.

It also sheds light on the challenges OPEC member and non-OPEC - which are also fighting a proxy conflict in Syria's civil war - will face in trying to clinch a global agreement to limit output growth to prop up oil prices.

The full details of how the Essar deal was struck remain unclear. Two industry sources said it was rescued thanks to the involvement of Putin and Modi while three other sources said Rosneft had simply outbid Saudi Aramco.

Officials in Modi's office declined to comment while Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied there was any Kremlin intervention in the deal.

""Naturally, we defend the interests of our companies. Of course we lobby for them, especially on such large deals,"" said Peskov, but added that in the case of Essar ""there were no orders from the Kremlin"".

""It was a corporate decision by Rosneft to gain synergies via cooperation with India,"" he said.

Rosneft and Saudi Aramco declined to comment.

Essar said it had held discussions with several potential buyers but had gone with the Rosneft consortium because their offer was considered the most attractive. It denied there was any intervention from Putin or Modi.

Showdown

Rosneft boss Igor Sechin is keen to buy refining assets around the world to guarantee outlets for Russian oil. He had been negotiating since 2014 to buy 49 percent of Essar from its owners, Indian brothers Ravi and Shashi Ruia, and the two parties had been in exclusive talks since July 2015 when a preliminary deal was signed.

While the exact amount Rosneft was prepared to offer for the stake at that stage is unclear, Russian and Indian industry sources said it valued the whole of Essar at about $5.7 billion.

However it became apparent that there were problems with the deal in early September, when Sechin travelled to to meet the Ruia brothers, flying from Hangzhou, China, where he had been part of Putin's G20 summit delegation.

Sechin walked into the meeting with the Ruia brothers soon after landing in at 1 a.m., determined to close the deal, according to sources briefed on the discussions.

As the meeting started, one of the brothers told Sechin the deal process had been going on for too long, the exclusivity period had expired in July and Essar was now talking to other parties.

Those other parties included Saudi Aramco, he said.

According to the sources familiar with how the meeting unfolded, Sechin responded by saying that if Essar walked away from the deal it risked losing Russian financial and oil-supply support.

The Ruia brothers then said the talks with Rosneft were over and called an abrupt end to the meeting.

""People started leaving the room, embarrassed,"" one of the sources said. Another source said the Essar management had drafted a statement to say the deal with Rosneft was off.

Rosneft and Essar declined to comment on what transpired at the meeting, or on whether such a statement had existed. Sechin and the Ruia brothers could not be reached for comment.

Three Saudi-based sources familiar with details of talks between Essar and Saudi Aramco said the firm was seriously considering buying Essar. One of the sources said Aramco was prepared to pay up to $9 billion for all or most of the refiner.

Aramco declined to comment on whether it had made a bid.

Too big to fail

In the end, however, the Rosneft-Essar deal proved to be too big to fail.

For India, a deal collapse or a delay because of talks with another party would set back Modi's drive to clean up India's $140 billion mountain of bad debt given Essar's multi-billion-dollar debts to local and foreign banks after years of rapid expansion.

For Russia, the deal in the huge Indian market represented an important milestone in building a global oil empire despite Western sanctions imposed on over its actions in Ukraine.

Facing the Saudi competition, Rosneft formed a consortium that bought 98 per cent of the refiner plus a fuel terminal for $13 billion. The Kremlin oil firm bought 49 percent - below the 50 percent level that would have fallen foul of Western sanctions - with Swiss trading house Trafigura and Russian private investment group UCP buying the other 49 percent.

According to the Indian and Russian industry sources, Rosneft and Essar returned to the negotiating table within days of the spat in early September, and the deal was finally struck.

One of the sources said there was a fierce battle between Essar and Rosneft over the terms. They said the Russian-led consortium was forced to outbid the Saudi offer, which they said comprised a combination of cash, long-term low interest credit and oil supplies.

Trafigura declined to comment on how the deal came together, while UCP did not reply to a written request asking for comment. Washington said the deal did not violate sanctions.

The deal was signed in Mauritius on Oct. 14, a day before a formal announcement on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Goa where Putin and Modi met. The leaders also oversaw the signing of a raft of other transactions including agreeing to pay $5 billion for Russian long-range air defence missile systems.

Two industry sources said the Essar deal had first been discussed by Putin and Modi as far back as May 2014 on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia's main investor show.

It was unclear what form - if any - high-level government intervention might have taken after the September dispute.

But the two sources said that without political will in Moscow and New Delhi, an agreement could not have been struck.

""Putin and Modi saved that deal,"" said one.

&gt;* During the 10-minute telephonic conversation, Mr. Singh is understood to have told Mr. Thackeray that Shiv Sena joining hands with the opposition, despite being part of the Modi government, was sending a confusing signal and such an action was avoidable.

&gt;* The Shiv Sena had on Wednesday taken part in a march to Rashtrapati Bhavan led by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and participated by Aam Aadmi Party and National Conference.

&gt;* The parties lodged their protests before President Pranab Mukherjee against Prime Minister Narendra Modis announcement of demonetisation of Rs.

&gt;* While the other parties which took part in the march sought immediate withdrawal of demonetisation exercise, the Shiv Sena had differed on the issue and insisted the government extend the deadline of accepting the old currency notes.

By: Nitindra Bandyopadhyay





The real estate industry is already feeling the pinch of Modi’s demonetisation move against black money. City-based developers, who did some good business during the festive season, have seen 60 per cent cancellations on the Deepawali bookings.







Venkatesh Reddy, a real estate dealer who has an office in HSR Layout, said: “We got good response during Deepawali compared with last year. Most people who came to check out flats paid a lump sum booking amount. But soon after the announcement, I have been getting calls for cancellation. Many don’t even mind losing the booking amount.”





A senior government official from the registrar office told Bangalore Mirror: “There is a group that invests with hard cash. Most of these real estate buyers are in the business of lending money and charge high interest rates. This group is in mourning.”





The city has been a preferred destination for investments in residential real estate as the prices of new inventories are lower compared with the saturated markets of Mumbai and National Capital Region (NCR). Despite this, in the last two quarters, this sector was troubled over unsold inventories rising out of a gap in demand and supply. Demonetisation would only add to the woes.





Shrinivas Rao, chief executive officer, Vestian Global Asia-Pacific, said, “It won’t affect the big realtors much.” That said, the smaller players make up 15-20 per cent of the market, and around 40 per cent of the stock in residential real estate, locally, is controlled by them. This involves a substantial amount of cash transaction, Rao explained.





“The city already has a stock of more than 1 lakh unsold residential inventories. This, coupled with demonetisation, will obviously lead to a drop in the value and a correction of price will happen in the next 18 months with real estate value expected to plummet 15-20 per cent,” he said.





The commercial real estate section, meanwhile, has been doing great and will likely witness a positive growth. There will be minimum impact on office industrial leasing and transactions business, given that cash components don’t play a significant role in such transactions, said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head, JLL India.





POSITIVE OUTLOOK





Real estate players, however, have stayed positive in their acceptance of the new order. Shivaram Kumar Malakala, co-founder and director of Habitat Ventures said the government’s decision would have medium to long-term positive impact, even though he expected some short-term glitches in the industry.





The real estate sector will definitely be affected by the demonetisation exercise, as it has traditionally seen very high involvement of black money and cash transactions. Such incidences have been in the secondary sales market, where cash components have traditionally been a veritable ‘must’. In other words, the resale properties segment will take a big hit.





“However, short-term pain is inevitable when we look for any eventual long-term cure for the disease. There has been, for long, a strident demand for transparency in the sector so that it becomes more organised, and cash dealings must necessarily be the first symptom of the disease to be dealt with,” said Ashwinder Raj Singh, CEO, residential services, JLL India.





Experts in unison said the impact will be felt across board with tier-II and tier-III markets taking a bigger hit. But with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Benami Act, and now this recent move, the real estate sector can expect a positive transformation ahead.





Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director, Knight Frank India, said: “The broader effects of this move will help the sector grow in the long run. Firstly, it will create a level playing field among all stakeholders. Institutional funding to developers, which until now came with a higher risk weightage, is bound to see some softening with the increased transparency.





MEANWHILE...





Rs 100, Rs 50 won’t be demonetised





Seeking to dispel rumours making the rounds, the Centre on Wednesday said there is no intention to demonetise Rs 100 and Rs 50 notes. In a series of tweets, the government described as “myth” a rumour that the prime minister will again address the nation to declare Rs 50/100 as invalid currency. “Baseless; no intention of cancelling legal tender status of notes of any other denomination,” PIB said in a tweet. It also described as “myth” the contention that cost of demonetisation is more than the benefits. There is no intention to seal bank lockers and freeze gold and diamond jewellery. On complaints that Rs 2,000 notes are of poor quality and colour comes off, the government said there is no need to worry as this is a security feature.







Oppn corners Centre, within and outside Parliament





Major Opposition parties, including the Congress and Trinamool Congress, on Wednesday took on the Narendra Modi government in and outside Parliament over the acute problems faced by people following the “financial calamity” unleashed by the demonetisation move. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is also the Trinamool supremo, and leaders of three other parties including the Shiv Sena, an NDA constituent, sought President Pranab Mukherjee’s intervention on the issue while Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi trained his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded action against “his friends” and those who are hoarding black money.





No holiday for banks today





All banks in the state will remain open on Thursday. Though it is a declared holiday on account of Kanakadasa Jayanti, the state government issued a notification, stating that banks must remain open. The move comes as a big boon to public which has been struggling to exchange or deposit notes following the Centre’s move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

The finance ministry’s officials admitted the government is falling far short of meeting requirements for Rs100 currency notes. Photo: PTI

Mumbai: For people expecting respite from the government’s clampdown on cash, here’s a reality check: it probably won’t come soon.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration may need until May 2017 to replenish the stock of now worthless bills, according to Saumitra Chaudhuri, an economist who advised Modi’s predecessor. The government on 8 November banned Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes in a surprise move against graft and tax evasion.

Delays in replacing the currency risk prolonging the pain in the $2 trillion economy, where about 98% of consumer payments are made in cash. Deutsche Bank AG predicts the crunch could easily shave off a half-point from India’s growth in October-December, which could imperil its position as the world’s fastest-growing major market.

This is how Chaudhuri reached his conclusion, which he published in a blog post on the Economic Times’ website: Extrapolating from central bank data, he estimates that Modi’s move sucked out about 16.6 billion notes of the 500-denomination, and 6.7 billion Rs1,000 bills. That means more than 23 billion notes totaling Rs15 trillion.

Modi intends to replace these with new Rs2,000 and Rs500 bills. However, Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt., which prints the higher denomination currency, has a stated capacity of just 1.3 billion notes a month. That’s with working double shifts. Raise this to triple shifts and it becomes 2 billion bills, which means it will need until the end of 2016 to replenish in value the Rs1,000 notes.

Security Printing &amp; Minting Corporation of India Ltd, whose capacity Chaudhuri estimates at 1 billion pieces a month, will need several more months to meet the Rs500 target, even if it joins forces with BRBNM, he said.

“Ergo, currency shortages will remain with us for many months and economic contraction will rule this period,” he wrote. “At the end of the period, confidence will be at new lows and recovery will take time.”

In what could make matters worse, the presses -- busy with the new bills -- have almost completely stopped printing Rs100 notes, Bloomberg Quint reported Wednesday citing central bank sources it didn’t name. These bills are the bread-and-butter of India’s $780 billion informal economy, which employs more than 90% of the workforce.

Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik rejected the assessment. “This is not correct, things will improve shortly,” he said. “Once supply of Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes increases and re-calibration of ATMs is over, which is underway on a fast pace, the situation will improve to a huge extent.”

The ministry’s officials, however, admitted the government is falling far short of meeting requirements for Rs100 notes. They declined to be identified, citing rules on speaking with the media.

In a teary-eyed appeal, Modi on Sunday requested Indians to bear the pain for 50 days. “After that, if any fault is found in my intentions or my actions, I am willing to suffer any punishment given by the country,” he said. Bloomberg

* The motive to kill counterfeit currency is really hollow. First, the amount in circulation in fake currency is approximately 400 Crore according to various reports (ISI, Finance minister himself said this in Parliament before) i.e. 0.02% of the complete circulation. Second, the new notes don't really have some revolutionary new security measure which would make counterfeiting impossible, they have just increased a few things here and there. It is only a matter of time fake currency would be again in the market, this time with a vengeance and in a higher denomination. Modi is really brainwashing gullible people of India and sadly, majority of our population is going to fall for this claim even though it isn't really effective and worth the pain the country is going through

* The 200% fine actually has some issues. Under income tax law, you can not impose a 200% fine. There issue is much more nuanced. People are preparing a case against it. I'll source this thing once I've time

New Delhi:  Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal made a double bore attack on the government today, warning that there will be intense protests and unrest if it does not withdraw its ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes. They also visited the Reserve Bank of India to check on the progress of printing new notes, Mr Kejriwal said.



""Take back this decision in three days... Don't test people's patience. Otherwise, there will be a 'bhagawat' (revolt) by people,"" said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at Delhi's Azadpur Mandi, the country's biggest wholesale hub.



He called the demonitisation the country's ""biggest scam since 1947.""



""Prime Minister Modi has broken constitutional rules...Why did not you (Modi) make a proper plan before the implementation (of demonetisation). The common man is suffering due to it. We are giving you three days. If you do not fix all problems, we will not leave you. We are still alive,"" vowed Mamata Banerjee, who is West Bengal Chief Minister.



Together the leaders also visited the office of the Reserve Bank of India in the capital. ""How much currency needed? How much printed? What is capacity? How many more days will it take? Me n Mamtadi at RBI to get this info,"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted.



Ms Banerjee had led a march on Wednesday to petition the President against the notes ban, but Mr Kejriwal had not joined her protest because, said sources, he did not wish to share space with the Shiv Sena, which is an ally of the ruling BJP, but threw in its lot with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress on this issue.



Mamata Banerjee's party, the fourth largest in the Lok Sabha, is trying to also move an adjournment motion in the house on demonetisation, which entails a debate followed by a vote.



Both houses of parliament were adjourned today as opposition members raised slogans against the government on the notes ban. In the Rajya Sabha or upper house, they demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi respond to questions they have raised in a debate on the issue.



The government has refused to give in to that demand. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this evening said ""there is no question of a roll back"" of the decision to abolish 500 and 1000 rupee notes, aimed at ending black or untaxed money. He also ruled out the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee as demanded by the opposition.



At the public rally Mr Kejriwal asked who was responsible for the death of 40 people who have reportedly died in incidents linked to the notes ban.



The sudden move to scrap high value notes has caused huge disruption to daily life with people standing in long queues for hours outside banks and ATMs.

New Delhi: Former Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie has strongly criticised the government's decision to ban 500 and 1000 rupee notes, saying while the stated objective may be good, the idea was not well thought out.



 
In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Mr Shourie said the government had not anticipated the distress that would be caused by doing ""away with 85% of Indian currency.""

""Small and medium enterprises, the transport sector, the entire agricultural sector...I can't reach six lakh villages,"" he said, adding, ""They did not think about this? It is about being carried away by a big idea, getting into a self-image that I have to do some surgical strike. Therefore every week you see them saying - its been a week, a month, I have to do something.""



 
When asked if he thought it was a bold and radical move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr Shourie said, ""jumping in the well is also very radical, committing suicide is also radical...if you want to make a beginning, make a beginning on reforming the tax administration.""



 
The former minister, who has been critical of PM Modi in the past, said he did not think the cash clean-up would get to the heart of the black or untaxed money problem. ""People who hold this black money or black assets don't hold it in cash...they are not going to put their money under the mattress...they are holding it abroad, and there also they are not dollars, in gunnybags. It is property, jewelry, maybe other assets which we don't know about, maybe stock markets,"" he said.



 
What was needed, he said, was strict and fair enforcement. ""Then you will be acting against the bribe taker and bribe giver. But if you let disproportionate assets cases fall through because you don't present evidence, you are doing nothing on the Vyapam scam, you are doing nothing on the Sarada scam, the Narada scam, you let Hasan Ali go, nothing happened, Moin Qureshi goes away, Vijay Mallya is saying bye bye, Lalit Modi keeps sitting outside, then what will the officer think?""



 
Mr Shourie, who was a union minister in the BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said he did not think India was ready to move to becoming a cashless economy. ""I have been writing on it for 35 years and I am all for it but this is the not the way to go about it,"" he said.Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelatedOpposition Finding Excuses To Scuttle Debate On Demonetisation: Venkaiah NaiduMore StoriesMore Dead From Notes Ban Than In Uri Attack: Ghulam Nabi Azad's ShockerDays After Notes Ban, Queues Shrink In Some CitiesAt Andhra Hospital, Wife Had To Drag Him Behind Her Up A Ramp

I mean, isn't Modi being dangerously reckless here?

130,"Well yeah. That was my point with MNREGA.

As far as the demonetization is concerned. The governments dialogue that it has been done to curb black money is complete bullshit. If anything, I believe and I have good reason to do so, that the only reason modi went ahead with demonetization is to bring the people who evade tax into the ""system"".

&gt;  You have to be completely bereft of the capability of critical analysis if you think demonetisation, or currency exchange (let's call it what it is), is a good plan.

Its not a good plan for black money. Its a genius move to bring the tax evader into the IT net. 

But think about that for a second, how can a politician possibly come out into the open media and state that he's done this to try and screw over the tax evaders, when almost 99% of our population (read: vote bank) does not pay tax? 

As a reply to the general condescension that your comment contains, I do read a lot, I do possess the capability of critical analysis, and I am also studying for a masters in economics.

How about we try to have a discussion based on the merit of the argument rather than condescension?  ",2016-11-17 20:31:25

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My business required me to have cash at me at all times. I also have a sick mother at home who might need hospitalisation because of this I had cash at home. That cash accounted to about 1 crore 52 lakhs. When the our beloved Prime Minister announced that the notes are illegal, I was happy as well as sad. I was happy because I wanted the people with black money to be punished. Meanwhile, I was sad because I had so much cash at home. All my cash was white and I have declared everything in my ITR. I pay 3-4 crores as tax every year and all my accounts are tallied correctly. I thought I could go to the bank and deposit this cash in my account. I went to the Basavangudi branch of SBI (which is the bank in which I have an account). Sadly, I had to wait for 4 hours in line and still my turn had not come. Its not the fault of the bank, but my time was being wasted. I manage my business without any help so I could not have my shop shut for a long time. I decided I would deposit my cash later and got busy with my business. My market has many people who have loads of black money and they were all worried about how to get their money converted to white. At this point, one man by the name Mr.Gopal Shridhar came to all the shops and told them he could get their money converted to white. In exchange he charged 10% commission and as surety he gave them a post dated cheque. Now, there was no way that the lines in the bank would be freed up and there was no way I could shut shops again to stand in the queue. So, I thought I would hire this service. After a lot of negotiations, I convinced him that my money is white and all he had to do was to deposit it in the bank. He agreed to do so for 1% comission which was fair enough. I gave him all the cash and so did my friend whom I do not want to name. My friend is one of the biggest dealers in Ceramics and he had about 15 crores money in black. 3 days later, we both tried reaching Gopal and Gopal told that the money was converted and we could both go and deposit the cheque. As advised, we did so and trusting Gopal did the job, we had a peaceful sleep with the burden gone from our backs.

Early morning next day, I saw two IT officers knock my door. I was shocked. They asked me about my transaction and told me that the cheque was bounced. They scared me with arrest and fine. It was a raid! An Income Tax raid. I immediately dialled my accountant and he was came as fast as he could with all the records. 4 hours of disconnection and searches later, the officer was convinced that I indeed did not have black money and they let me go with an apology. But my friend who had 15 crores of black money has to pay 14 crores 95 Lakhs as fine and go to jail for 3 months, unless the court gives him a bail! Even if he gets a bail, he has to pay a bond of 10 lakhs so he is losing all the money he had. I was shocked and I patted myself on the back for paying taxes correctly.

I spoke to the officer over tea and the officer told me that the govt. has appointed SFM force (Special Field Monitoring) who act as agents to convert black money to white. They also give you assurance through post dated cheque and pretend like they charge a commission ranging from 5% to 30% to make it look realistic.

This is great work done by our PM Modi. This idea was personally developed by Modiji and is estimated to help catch nearly 50,000 people with black money. Today, I am proud to be an Indian and a honest tax paying Indian! Jai Narendar Modi! Jai Hind! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!

NEW DELHI:US President elect+will approve a Congress bill todeclare Pakistan a terror state+when the legislation reaches him in what would be a shot in arm for India's antiterror narrative, said Shalabh Kumar, a key Indian-origin member of Donald Trump's advisory council and prominent businessman. ""President Trump and PM Narendra Modi willundoubtedly share a good chemistry+. The Indo-US partnership is expected to touch new heights under Trump Presidency.



A key step that the new president is expected to take is to give assent to the US Congress bill that has been introduced in the house to declare Pakistan a terror state when the legislation reaches him,"" Kumar told ET in an exclusive interaction over phone from USA days after the presidential polls.



Mounting pressure on Pakistan in the backdrop of theUri terror attacks+, two influential US Congressmen for the first time ever introduced a legislation to designate Pakistan as a terror state by the administration in Washington last September. Congressman Ted Poe, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, along with Congressman Dana Rohrabacher introduced the 'Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act' in the House on Tuesday. The legislation calls on the US administration to provide a report on designation of Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.



""The stars have aligned - Modi took the bold step to initiatedemonetisation to fight black money+and within hours Donald Trump became the 45th President of USA,"" noted an ecstatic Kumar, indicating good days ahead for the bilateral partnership. Kumar, who made a fortune as an entrepreneur after migrating to the USA in the 1960s, said the transition team of the president elect is well versed with Indian affairs. He claimed that senior members of Indian government are in touch with Trump team enabling continuity in Indo-US ties.



Dismissingfears of loss of jobs for Indian IT professionals+under Trump presidency with stricter rules for H1-B visas, Kumar claimed that as US economy will grow by 4-5 % annually under Trump and will boost America's service sector. ""This will increase the demand for Indian IT professionals in America. You will recall positive noises that Trump made about India during his campaign."" He also predicted an increase in Indo-US trade over the next four years.



An area that is expected to receive further boost under Trump presidency is the Indo-US Defence partnership, Kumar said. However, he suggested that India must initiate further steps to encourage ease of doing business including tax reforms and favourable legal mechanism to attract American investments in India.



Kumar, who maintains close contacts with both BJP and RSS, is a member of Indian American Advisory Council of Trump and member of Asian American Advisory Council of Trump. Kumar, the owner of an electronics manufacturing company (AVG Advanced Technologies) and founder of the Republican Hindu Coalition, donated a whopping $898,000 (approximately Rs 6 crore) towards Trump's victory campaign.

&gt;With no state election funding, illicit cash is the lifeblood for political parties that collect money from candidates and businessmen, and then spend it to stage rallies, hire helicopters and hand out ""gifts"" to win votes.

&gt;...

&gt;**According to the Delhi-based Center for Media Studies (CMS), which tracks campaign financing, the BJP relies on cash for less than two-thirds of its funding in a state like Uttar Pradesh.**

&gt;**Its regional rivals use cash to cover 80 to 95 percent of campaign spending.**

&gt;...

They are asking for demonetization to be rolled back and old currency notes to be legalized because otherwise their election funds and their political survival are at stake.

Examples like this show that at some level the government's move IS effective against a significant amount of hoarded black money, although the collateral damage to common people and businesses is also significant.",2016-11-18 00:13:01
159,"I am no Modi bhakt but looking at the list there are things like:

&gt; A 45-year-old farmer allegedly committed suicide as he was apparently upset over not being able to get his high-denomination notes exchanged for fresh ones due to serpentine queues in banks.


&gt; Immediately after PM Modi informed the nation of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes on national TV, a businessman began feeling chest pain. He succumbed to a heart attack that followed

&gt; An elderly woman living alone died of heart attack counting her notes. Her body was found with R2.69 lakh worth of old currency notes.

&gt; Sumit, a class 12th student, a 17-year-old boy allegedly committed suicide over not possessing smaller denomination notes


All the deaths where people died of exhaustion/ heart attack while standing in line or were denied medical treatment is real and have to be blamed on this. But cmon, some of them are clearly just blamed on it. This happens fairly commonly. Remember 20 something people committed suicide after Andhra's YSR died? Turns out a lot of unrelated farmer suicides and other deaths were labeled as death because of YSR's death by the media. I mean why would you kill yourself if a politician is gone?

I have a feeling a lot of unrelated deaths are also on this 47 list which have been blamed on demonetization. But majority of them look legit and is very shameful.",2016-11-18 00:17:43

I hope AAP cadres do not emulate their allies in Punjab and Delhi in the near future.

[**Modi's cash crackdown hits Indian rivals' election campaign coffers**](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-modi-corruption-politics-idUSKBN13B2YW)

&gt;With no state election funding, illicit cash is the lifeblood for political parties that collect money from candidates and businessmen, and then spend it to stage rallies, hire helicopters and hand out ""gifts"" to win votes.

&gt;...

&gt;**According to the Delhi-based Center for Media Studies (CMS), which tracks campaign financing, the BJP relies on cash for less than two-thirds of its funding in a state like Uttar Pradesh.**

&gt;**Its regional rivals use cash to cover 80 to 95 percent of campaign spending.**

Possibly among the worst affected by the demonetization scheme are our regional parties, who've had most of their cash reserves for election time wiped out in one swoop.

This latest move confirms beyond doubt that AAP really is no different in how it conducts politics compared to the parties it opposes. And I thought having transparent funding was one of their USPs.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday rejected demand for Prime Minister Narendra Modis response on the debate on demonetisation and accused the opposition of using it as an excuse to scuttle discussion on the issue in Parliament.

&gt; * The opposition disrupted the Rajya Sabha, stalling midway the discussion on demonetisation that started on Wednesday.

Rajawat’s controversial jibe came at a time when opposition parties were accusing Modi government of giving prior information of demonetisation to industrialists and black money hoarders.

Rajawat refuted giving any such statement to media. “I was just chatting informally with some journalists but did not give any statement against demonetisation,” he told Hindustan Times.

He, however, said demonetisation was affecting farmers due to currency crunch but the move would certainly fetch black money.

This is not the first time when Rajawat is in trouble for his controversial jibe.

He was earlier accused of threatening people to give votes to the BJP in the Kota Municipal Corporation election in 2014 and had questioned the role of coaching students from Bihar studying in Kota behind the alleged murder of a student from the state.

Couple of months ago, the three-time MLA from Ladpura had talked about gunning down the crocodiles that he said had been troubling the people of his constituency.

New Delhi:  Former Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie has strongly criticised the government's decision to ban 500 and 1000 rupee notes, saying while the stated objective may be good, the idea was not well thought out.



In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Mr Shourie said the government had not anticipated the distress that would be caused by doing ""away with 85% of Indian currency.""



""Small and medium enterprises, the transport sector, the entire agricultural sector...I can't reach six lakh villages,"" he said, adding, ""They did not think about this? It is about being carried away by a big idea, getting into a self-image that I have to do some surgical strike. Therefore every week you see them saying - its been a week, a month, I have to do something.""



When asked if he thought it was a bold and radical move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr Shourie said, ""jumping in the well is also very radical, committing suicide is also radical...if you want to make a beginning, make a beginning on reforming the tax administration.""



The former minister, who has been critical of PM Modi in the past, said he did not think the cash clean-up would get to the heart of the black or untaxed money problem. ""People who hold this black money or black assets don't hold it in cash...they are not going to put their money under the mattress...they are holding it abroad, and there also they are not dollars, in gunnybags. It is property, jewelry, maybe other assets which we don't know about, maybe stock markets,"" he said.



What was needed, he said, was strict and fair enforcement. ""Then you will be acting against the bribe taker and bribe giver. But if you let disproportionate assets cases fall through because you don't present evidence, you are doing nothing on the Vyapam scam, you are doing nothing on the Sarada scam, the Narada scam, you let Hasan Ali go, nothing happened, Moin Qureshi goes away, Vijay Mallya is saying bye bye, Lalit Modi keeps sitting outside, then what will the officer think?""



Mr Shourie, who was a union minister in the BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said he did not think India was ready to move to becoming a cashless economy. ""I have been writing on it for 35 years and I am all for it but this is the not the way to go about it,"" he said.

If Government does not concede in some form then Opposition going to cause ruckus and Parliament will not function. I think BJP wants this and they will do this try to disrupt the parliament themselves or manipulate the chutiya opposition to do it for them. The impression I get is they trying to buy time, but is it running out. If the parliament is keeps adjourning and the situation on the grounds does not improve, the opposition will come out on the streets and protest. And its anyones guess what will happens when people are protesting on the street for days and the situation doesn't improve. If I right, the only way BJP comes up on top with this Strategy, is trying to bring the system back to normal ASAP and minimize the adverse impacts that have such a ill conceived and unplanned Policy.

Opposition rushing members to the floor in protest agasint the Policy also NDA member screaming from beaches demanding an apology. Lmao NDA disrupting the house. You are ruling party, think with you brain, if you try disrupt parliament and none of you bills pass this session. No GST, no further no tax and structural reform to fix the demand side of black money. Good luck Indian Economy. This whole exercise would have been futile.

Edit 11:30 AM: Round 2 this time NDA member rush to the floor of the house. Demanding apology for yesterdays comments. Screaming and sloganerring. Rest of the parties join in on the shit fest. Speaker trying his best, poor fellow. Approximate 5 mins in, house adjourned again till 12:00 PM

EDIT 12:00 PM. No one seems to back down. Adjournment again. Don't think anything gonna get done today. 

EDIT 1:00 PM. News Report saying Government next move is attack on large property transaction in the last 10 year. Yeah good luck going through all those million transition. 

EDIT 2:30 PM. Speaker told everyone to Figuratively to Calm the Fuck down and that there would be no more adjournment without introducing some bills in the parliament. The most significant new bill that was introduced would  declare Pakistan as a terrorist state based on their state funding of terrorist, introduced. 

Edit 3:00 Pm. We adjourned for the day in both house. BJP bought some more time. Government announced that petrol pump belonging to public oil cooperation will function as ATMs for SBI cards.

The first story was about a doc on whom a rumour was spread about his property being raided by IT sleuths and there was a local uproar from people and some miscreants used it to claim his death.

The second was claimed to be true by various other publications - only the bank name was mentioned incorrectly by some and later retracted. That doesn't make the death fake.

NEW DELHI: A glimpse of how much the world's richest man, whose current net worth of $87.4 billion is more than the market value of India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries, enjoys India could be witnessed at Delhi's India Gate on Thursday morning.



Bill Gates+was zipping around in a phut phut (modified three-wheeler) for a virtual reality film being shot on the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.



Since 2002, when it started operations in India, the foundation has invested $1 billion in India. It's looking to do much more in the country. ""I am very optimistic on India. Even if one of my ideas contributes to making a difference to the lives of 1.3 billion Indians, it will be huge for me,"" Gates told TOI in an exclusive interaction.



He was referring to the ideas he shared during his lecture on technology for transformation at Niti Ayog on Wednesday. The lecture was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,finance minister Arun Jaitley+along with other ministers and top officials.



Gates believes digital payments can transform the lives of poor, and ifdemonetisation+helps quicken digitisation, the temporary pains may be worth going through.



""Government transitions are never managed perfectly and never easy,"" he said, referring to the transitory problems caused by the replacement of high-value currency notes.



""India is pushing towards digitisation in a big way. The scale of the country means that once India gets there, the amount of digital innovation here will be greater than anywhere else in the world,"" Gates said. Among big benefits of digital financial transactions, he counted a deep reduction in the cost of borrowing for the poor.



Swachh Bharat is another government initiative Gates is excited about. His foundation is working with California Institute of Technology to develop what he calls a ""reinvented toilet"" that will dispose of waste without the toilet being connected to a sewage system.



The India that Gates sees now is very different from the one he saw during his active years withMicrosoft. ""Now I am more in Patna than in Hyderabad and Bangalore. And it's great to see progress in Bihar,"" he says, proving that his optimism for India is not skin deep.

1. With no state election funding, illicit cash is the lifeblood for political parties that collect money from candidates and businessmen, and then spend it to stage rallies, hire helicopters and hand out ""gifts"" to win votes.

2. ""Their calculation is that this is going to hurt everybody, but in relative terms the BJP is going to come out stronger,"" said Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.

3. According to the Delhi-based Center for Media Studies (CMS), which tracks campaign financing, the BJP relies on cash for less than two-thirds of its funding in a state like Uttar Pradesh. Its regional rivals use cash to cover 80 to 95 percent of campaign spending.

4. ""We will have to plan the entire election strategy all over again,"" said Pradeep Mathur, a senior Uttar Pradesh leader of the Congress. Demonetization will force Congress to hold smaller rallies, said Mathur, and there will be fewer ""freebies"" for voters.

5. Other parties are also adjusting plans in Uttar Pradesh. Ashok Agarwal, a politician with the incumbent Samajwadi Party in the city of Mathura, will have to rely more on his team of 1,000 volunteers to connect with voters.

6. One senior official and a close aide to Mayawati said some of her party's rallies would be axed and replaced by more door-to-door campaigning.

7. Event managers, whose businesses usually boom at election time, are worried. ""No political party except the BJP wants to organize big rallies before January. All of them depend on cash,"" said Rajesh Pratap, who has provided loudspeakers, outdoor air conditioners and security to party rallies for over a decade.

8. Spending on the Uttar Pradesh election is forecast to hit a record 40 billion rupees ($590 million), despite the cancellation of big notes.

The BS Papers - BullShit Papers?

[Birla &amp; Sahara Papers](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article9345953.ece)

There's a Iranian Proverb: “If a bald man were capable of curing baldness, he would cure himself first!”

Or we can just say, The blind leading the blind!

Sahara Papers

- Documents allegedly recovered from the Sahara premises during a raid on November 22, 2014 by the Income Tax Department show payments to several politicians, including some Chief Ministers and MPs from various political parties, running into crores.

-  It ought to have been shared by the IT department with the CBI &amp; SIT on black money, since the matter was not limited to income tax violations but included bribery, corruption and black money. 

- The persons named in the diary who had apparently received ought to have been raided and investigated for disproportionate assets, but the same was not done.

- Authencity of said Sahara papers - In a report on July 1, Anurag Sharma, Assistant Director (documents) of the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, said: “On intense comparison of red enclosed signatures stamped and marked X1 &amp; X2 (only reproduction copies made available by the forwarding authority), some similarities are observed in the formation of characters between the two signatures which collectively indicates that these two signatures stamped and marked X1 &amp; X2 appear to be written by one and the same person.”

Birla Papers

- The documents seized by the CBI in its search operation in Mumbai reportedly revealed massive bribery of politicians and officials of various ministries by the Aditya Birla group over several years. The simultaneous search operation conducted on 15.10.2013 by the CBI at Aditya Birla group’s office at Parliament Street, New Delhi, reportedly led to the recovery of a huge stash of unaccounted for cash of Rs 25 crore besides incriminating documents.

- The documents also show a payment of Rs 7.08 crore during January 9, 2012 to February 2, 2012 for “Project J- Environment &amp; Forest.” Mr. Bhushan says this was the time when allegations of corruption had emerged in environment clearances being issued by the UPA government.

- From the laptop of Aditya Birla Group Executive President Subhendu Amitabh, the raiding party recovered details of some financial transactions. A particular email of November 16, 2012 reports an alleged payment of Rs 25 crore to an entity referred to as a CM (Gujarat), with Rs 12 crore already delivered, according to the complaint.

So why was this Birla &amp; Sahara Papers not scrutinised by CBI? 


Both Sahara group and Birla group have approached the Settlement Commission of Income Tax to settle and bury the whole issue. - Now shouldn't that be vehemently opposed by this govt which is purportedly going against curbing Black Money in India?

So coming back to the proverbs, Mr. Modi, these are some very serious allegations against you. Under normal circumstances, you wouldn't even have to bother because, hey a PM doesn't have to bother about some xyz throwing about some allegations in the air without an iota of evidence, but now what with your Surgical Strike specifically against Black Money and even calling the whole of India to participate in your Demonetisation Drive, it is only justifiable for you to break your silence over this BS Papers issue.

Your statement is necessary because you have been mentioned in those papers (or atleast an entry) alleging to your esteemed CM office! And what's more, these were unearthed during the raids of the Coal block allocation!! Yes, the very same Coal scam which you used in your BM speech in Goa to deride Rahul Gandhi and Congress.

So its only imperative for you to categorically deny that you had nothing to do with that illegal 25Cr (40Cr?) alleged to your esteemed CM office and your name. 

Else, this whole exercise would just be a case of the Blind leading the Blind!

NEW DELHI: Digging in his heels, Finance MinisterArun Jaitleyon Thursday ruled out roll back of thedemonetisation+decision and slammed Delhi and West Bengal chief ministers accusing them of spreading ""unnecessary panic"".



He said the move to demonetise the high value notes was ""very well planned"", and added that the rush in bank branches is ""significantly"" coming down and 22,000 ATMs are getting recalibrated daily in order to dispense Rs 100, and new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes.



Criticising senior Congress leaderGhulam Nabi Azad's comments+in the Rajya Sabha, Jaitley said opposition has developed ""cold feet"" to debate the issue of demonetisation and criticised Azad for making irresponsible political comment.



Jaitley said he expected every responsible citizen, political party, state governments to support this huge effort because this will mean that India's formal economy will increase, access to banking will increase, taxation quantum will increase, banks will have far more money to support the economy in terms of trade, interest rates will come down, and therefore the kind of economy it will generate is huge.



""Now unnecessary panic is being spread particularly by some individuals and I didn't expect chief ministers of one or two states to join in this effort,"" Jaitley told ANI.



Rejecting the demand of political parties likeAam Admi Party and Trinamool Congress+, he said, ""whatever AAP and Trinamool Congress said about the roll back, there is no question of that. It is a clear decision of the Prime Minister and government to cleanse politics and economy of the country. We will stick to it (demonetisation)"".



Jaitley questioned the ""vested interest"" of Congress party in opposing government's effort to root out black money.



""At the end of the day, this exercise will only succeed in rooting out black money, crime money and make the Indian economy cleaner. Congress as a national party must support this,"" he said.



In a major assault on black money and terror financing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes and asked holders of such notes to deposit them in bank accounts.



Jaitley said Rs 14 lakh crore or 86 per cent of India's currency has been withdrawn and replacement is being done and printing of the new currency was done in adequate by the RBI much in advance.



""The whole thing is a very well planned and executed exercise. Obviously in the first two-three days there was a lot of rush, last three days I have been going everyday myself to look at bank branches and I can say with full confidence that the rush has significantly come down... and today it has come down substantially,"" he said.



Jaitley said 22,000 ATMs are being recalibrated in a day on war footing and in next few days all would be dispensing money. ""RBI has provided more than adequate currency to the currency chest, there is absolutely no shortage"".



He said the earlier currency exchange limit of Rs 4,500 was being ""misused"". Following complaints that people are being hired to convert money and that is responsible for big queue, the government decided to start using indelible ink and reduced the limit of currency exchange to Rs 2,000 per person till December 30.



""For me, there is a great regret that some people have been inconvenienced, which was bound to take place in an operation of this kind because the larger object in the interest of country that we have to squeeze the quantum of currency, we have to withdraw the quantum of currency which was used in generation of black money, counterfeit. And we had to allow normal volume of currency in the market...,"" he said.



He said most chief ministers across the country have not only supported this but they have in a big manner used the apparatus of state government to support this entire move.



On why the government was targeting only cash to unearth black money, Jaitley said it was necessary to squeeze cash to prevent generation of more black money.



""You have to squeeze cash because black money generates more black money. Not whatever is in assets is a matter of assessment by the income tax authorities. But whatever is lying in hard cash so that it does not generate anything for the future, has to be squeezed out,"" he added.



Jaitley also dismissed the criticism that banks have written off loans belonging to large industrial houses.



""Write off in the banking parlance, does not mean loan waiver. It just means, that a performing asset has become a non-performing asset. And therefore the opposition must understand the banking terminology before making an irresponsible statement,"" he added.

It’s been over a week since demonetisation, but the queues and the chaos continue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose decision to scrap ₹500 and ₹1,000 rupee notes has been intensely criticised, has asked for patience.

“I have asked the country for just 50 days,” Modi said during a speech in Goa on Sunday. “Brothers and sisters, give me 50 days.”

New notes are being printed, officials say, and those notes are being distributed to banks and ATMs as fast as possible. But will that happen in 50 days? The answer is, probably not.

Printing new notes could take about six months

Here’s the math. The new rupee notes are being printed at four mints. Together, they can print about three billion notes per month.

The mints have to replace about ₹14 trillion taken out of circulation — roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Portugal. If half that value is printed in ₹500 rupee notes and the other half is printed in ₹2,000 rupee notes, the mints will have to print around 17.5 billion total notes to replace the value of the notes taken out of circulation.

Isn't it similar to how randia has also reacted. Initially, everyone, I mean everyone - irrespective of their party affiliations, cheered on this unprecedented move in this day and age! We were led to believe by that 9pm address that this is something that will cleanse this nation of black money and fake currency.

When the government was unable to substantiate their claims by having a concrete game-plan for such a monumental feat, coupled with no additional steps apart from releasing new notes (like targting the big cats and the real black stash abroad) and further the sarcastic remarks by Modi on how only dishonest people were feeling the brunt of the move when clearly the whole of the lower middle class and poor were standing in lines for what is rightfully theirs, coupled with insenstivity from the government regarding those people who died (yeah actually died due to this) have all but entirely put out the initial euphoria.

If only this govt was firm on the black money or the fake currency agenda, this would have been their defining moment - but on relying on their tried and tested strategy of Jumla's - they've only made sure to create a monumental clusterfuck!",2016-11-18 13:25:05

""Denominations Of Notes :

(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), bank notes shall be of the denominational values of two rupees, five rupees, ten rupees, twenty rupees, fifty rupees, one hundred rupees, five hundred rupees, one thousand rupees, five thousand rupees and ten thousand rupees or of such other denominational values, not exceeding ten thousand rupees, as the Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central Board, specify in this behalf.

(2) The Central Government may, on the recommendation of the Central Board, direct the non-issue or the discontinuance of issue of bank notes of such denominational values as it may specify in this behalf.""

Given that two thousand rupee notes did not already exist, it was necessary for the Central Government to make a specification in this regard, after recommendation of the Central Board. The Central Board consists of 17-20 members which are appointed as per the procedure mentioned in this Act. Hence, at least 17-20 people knew of this demonetization scheme long before the decision was taken. Of course, that is assuming that the legal procedure was followed. 

It is also to be noted the such specification is generally made by a notification in the Official Gazette of India. Was such a notification made in this case? Not to my knowledge. Anybody care to shed light on this? 

Finally, if you take a look at General Clauses Act, it is specified that in contexts like these, Central Government means the President of India. When did Modi become the President? 

This decision is not legally tenable. 

Edit : It seems that notifications have been issued for monetization of 2000 notes and demonetization of 500 and 1000 notes. This means that legal procedure was followed. This means that the Central Board knew. This means that Modi lied when he said that only 2-3 people knew. It's likely that the super rich had already been leaked such information.

People line up in a long queue outside a bank in New Delhi

North MP on Wednesday faced opposition flak after his comment on deaths of people in bank queues - ""kuchh pane ke liye, kuchh khona padta hai.""

Shetty made the remark when he was asked to speak on the deaths of some persons who joined long queues outside banks or ATMs to exchange the demonetised Rs 500-Rs 1000 currency or make withdrawals.

""Every year, 3,500 commuters die on railway tracks, five lakh people are killed in road accidents, many more die in terror attacks and other incidents, but nobody speaks about them. For gaining something, you have to lose something,"" Shetty told a private news channel.

The opposition pounced on the lawmaker terming his statement as ""insensitive"" and divorced from the ground realities of the huge suffering experienced by the common citizens across the country.

Lashing out at Shetty, Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant demanded action against the MP for his remarks which he said added ""salt to the wounds"" of the people spending so many hours daily in long queues.

Bharatiya Janata Party ally at the Centre and in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena's spokesperson Arvind Sawant termed Shetty's statement as ""far from the ground reality.""

""He should first step outside and experience the sufferings of the people who have been hit by before making such statements,"" Sawant said.

Nationalist Congress Party spokesperson Nawab Malik flayed Shetty saying they have lost touch with the ground situation and are not concerned about the pain of the people.

So far, at least five persons have died in incidents directly linked with the November 8 announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

While a 73-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died in Mulund on Friday, an infant lost his life a day after when he was denied admission to a Govandi hospital as his parents only had the old currency notes for paying the deposit.

A 42-year-old man, Chhotelal Jaiswal, suffered a heart attack after waiting for over five hours in a queue in Kalwe suburb of Thane on Tuesday and later died in a hospital.

On Wednesday, tragedy struck twice. A 50-year-old man, Deepak Shah, collapsed and died after standing in a queue for over two hours in Bhayander town, Thane.

In Nanded, a 60-year-old man, Digamber Kasbe, faced a similar fate after waiting several hours to exchange old notes at a PSU bank.

The oil ministry has decided not to take any coercive action to recover the $1.55 billion it has demanded from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) as compensation for producing gas allegedly at the expense of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) from a shared offshore reservoir while the dispute remains under arbitration, an official aware of the development said.

Keeping the demand, raised on 4 November, in abeyance is a departure from the approach the government had taken in several past disputes that have gone into arbitration, including with RIL and Cairn India Ltd. The development will avert an immediate financial impact on RIL, one of the largest private investors in the oil and gas sector.

The move is also set to signal certainty of the regulatory regime governing resolution of disputes in the natural resources sector, and is in line with the Modi administration’s intent to improve the country’s track record on enforcing commercial contracts, an indicator in World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking.

The oil ministry has been campaigning for investments into hydrocarbon exploration and has set a target for reducing oil and gas import dependence by 10 percentage points to 67% by 2022.

The ministry raised the demand after the Justice A.P. Shah panel, which looked into ONGC’s claim of gas flow between the neighbouring fields of the two companies, recommended on 31 August that RIL should compensate for the “unfair enrichment” it had by way of retaining the gains of gas flow into its block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG D6).

“Recovery of the compensation will be kept in abeyance. There is little sanctity in arbitration if coercive measures are taken simultaneously,” a person briefed about the oil ministry’s position said on condition of anonymity.

An email sent to RIL on Thursday remained unanswered at the time of publishing.

This contrasts with the approach the government had taken earlier. When gas price was raised by 33% to $5.61 per million British thermal unit on 18 October 2014, the government insisted that since an arbitration with Reliance was pending since November 2011 on recovery of cost of gas production, the incremental revenue from price hike should be kept in an account maintained by GAIL (India) Ltd till legal proceedings are over. That arbitration is still on.

Also, the government had in May 2014 attached the residual stake of 10% that UK’s Cairn Energy Plc holds in Cairn India Ltd in relation to a tax dispute arising from the controversial 2012 retrospective amendment to the Income Tax Act. That dispute too is in arbitration.

Dispute resolution is one area the government is working on to improve investor interest in the country’s sedimentary basins, the entire unexplored part of which will be opened up for bids next year under a new open acreage policy. Director General of Hydrocarbons Atanu Chakraborty told Mint in an interview published on 13 October that the upstream regulator was planning to set up a portal to facilitate communication among stakeholders in the industry that will help in reducing disputes. At the moment, there is no such mechanism for companies operating different blocks which are adjacent to one another.

According to Kalpana Jain, senior director, Deloitte in India, prolonged disputes do not augur well for the natural resources sector considering the high risk and capital-intensive nature of the industry.

244,"It is no secret that this is an hot issue and everybody wants to attack the Modi govt in any way they can. So the kind of baseless statements and threats Mamta or Kejru are making are just for political gain. 

But we should not ignore the problems that the current scheme has 

1) Lack of public knowledge about it to common people. The way it was announced was not good, they could have bought a 30 minute slot on every tv channel and announced via that instead of a youtube video. Media is biased as hell and thus either people were praising modi or critising him but almost no one was willing to give all the details about how things are going to happen. 

2) Too much flexibility in the policy, yeah I understand it is a big move and thus requires you to be flexible to make the most of it, but there is a new circular about it everyday and that is a little too much. Have a circular on every bank holiday. 

3) When people like Kejriwal and Mamta are creating hysteria among masses, we do not have our favourite leader(aka Modiji) attacking them with his own PR dept. It helps when leader of your country tells you that everything is under control and things are going to get better. It is a big move and govt needs people on their side to make it a success. 

4) Medical facilities are a big issue and I think govt should have thought of something about it. Most of the private banks are not accepting old currency notes or are asking for a lot more to accept them. They should have had better facility for this. 

The policy or rather how they are handling things now is far from a failure but is not as flawless as it should have been. ",2016-11-18 16:02:32
245,"Hmm. I think the author is torn between two emotions. He has been very critical of Modi in the past but he certainly admires this demonetization action. 

His critique though has generally been insightful and devoid of rhetoric and partisanship, not that one agrees with it. Most importantly, he writes extremely well unlike the other 'popular' journalists. His 2010 book 'Serious Man' was very enjoyable. ",2016-11-18 16:03:28

He and Mamta have a lot similarity. They both were seen as the person who would stand up to the system, but they become a bigger burden on the people.

Mamta is TMC and TMC is Mamta.


AAP is Kejriwal and Kejriwal is AAP.


He knows he cannot win with Modi, but he can become the biggest opponent of him surpassing Rahul Gandhi and other regional parties.",2016-11-18 16:08:21
248,"Yep.

I don't think you realize this, but you're talking to someone who was strongly opposed to voting Modi in power. Not because I had a problem with his policies, but because I wasn't convinced he did his best he could during godhra. I felt that voting someone like him would've raised the confidence of hindutva elements and polarized the country further.

I like this sudden demonitization though. At its worse, it'll encourage a lot of people dealing in black money to launder money as soon as they get it. At its best, it'll reduce the black economy itself. One way or the other, it'll route the money back into the economy.",2016-11-18 16:26:38
249,"Several changes have been made in the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes to crack down on corruption and counterfeit currency. Several amendments have been made in the original announcement since then.

&gt; * Initially, the exchange limit for Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes was capped at Rs 4,000 and withdrawals were restricted to Rs 2,000 per card per day, and later to Rs 4,000 per card per day.

&gt; * Till November 11, government-authorised places, institutions and services such as hospitals, Railways, airline, bus ticket booking counters, petrol, diesel and gas stations authorised by public sector oil companies, consumer co-operative stores, milk booths, crematoriums, burial grounds, toll plazas, pharmacies, onboard rail catering and LPG cylinder supplies were authorised to accept old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes for payment.

&gt; * While reviewing the demonetisation process, the Narendra Modi Government also received reports that Jan Dhan accounts were being used by other people to deposit their unaccounted cash.

&gt; * Minutes after PM Narendra Modi made the historic announcement in his 8 pm address to the nation on November 8, the Government learnt that some people rushed to jewellery shops to buy golden ornaments with a view to converting their unaccounted cash.

Inconvenienced but all for it -- a small market in Mirzapur perhaps best captures the prevailing mood in eastern Uttar Pradesh following the government’s surprise move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes.



Ram Sudhar runs a small electric goods shop in Mirzapur’s Jamui bazaar. He was watching news on television on November 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes had ceased to be legal tenders.



Two days later, he went to a wholesaler in Varanasi to procure wires, cables, light bulbs and other supplies. He offered to pay in banned currency. The wholesaler refused and told him he could take goods worth Rs 50,000 and pay him later.



Over the week, Sudhar has seen his daily sales dip from around Rs 4,000 to Rs 1,000. The local market has only two banks and cash supply is limited, which means customers have little money in hand to buy from him.



Read | We did the math: Replacing all the old currency will likely take several months



He is in a bind -- he owes money to the wholesaler and his earnings have dropped.



What does he think of the note ban? “Bhaiya, it is not a ban. If it was a ban, we would have been destroyed. They have only asked us to deposit the notes and given us time. I think it is a very good move.”



Despite the inconvenience? “If our jawans can protect us 24 hours, we can stand in the bank queue for a few hours in national interest,” Sudhar said, referring to soldiers standing guard at the borders.



In Mirzapur’s Jamui, Shatrughan Bishwakarma (left) and Ram Sudhar (right) have both seen drop in their shop sales. Yet, they support the move. (HT Photo)



And what is this national interest? Sudhar has a quick answer -- money will come into banks, people with black money will be ensnared and the economy will be swachh (cleaned). “In two weeks, it will all be fine.”



Next to Sudhar’s shop is Shatrughan Bishwakarma’s small workshop where he repairs motorbikes. Business has been bad.



“Who will come to repair bikes if they have no money? I used to earn about 500 a day, it is now down to 100,” says Bishwakarma.



And what does he think of the move to withdraw high-value notes? “Money will flow into banks. It will increase government’s resources and will lead to a more equal society. For too long, too much money has been with too few people.”



A little ahead on the same road is Prem Singh’s medical store. He greeted Modi’s announcement with relief – he had deposited a “substantial” sum in his account the same morning.



Sales have dropped but Singh is not worried. His books, he says, are clean.



Read | Why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already won the demonetisation gambit



“Many people who have hoarded crores in cash will have to bring it in the market. This will help improve the economy.” But reports -- including in HT -- have shown that cash accounts for a small chunk of the black economy. Singh has a ready answer for it as well. “That is why Modiji has said he will go after property next.”



Is he a BJP supporter? Singh, a Kurmi (other backward class or OBC), says “No, I was with the Samajwadi Party. The local MLA is a relative. But this time, I may vote BJP.”



Caste matters a lot in India’s Uttar Pradesh and especially now with the state due for the assembly election early next year.



There are many corrupt people in the BJP’s ranks, he says, but no one dare get involved in corruption. “Modiji is against corruption,” says Singh.



Sudhar, Bishwakarma and Singh, who come from different castes, are not exceptions in small town Uttar Pradesh.



Every conversation -- in HT’s travels across Mirzapur, Varanasi, Azamgarh, Jaunpur -- revolved around how there was a lot of pareshani (inconvenience) -- people don’t have access to their own money and are struggling to meet daily needs.



Yet, most interactions ended with how “Modiji” – the demonetisation move is identified more sharply with the PM than his government -- has done the right thing.



There are murmurs of dissent as well – from those worried about their livelihoods and also those responsible for helming the change.



Tangible suffering, intangible good



Many, it appears, are willing to go through immediate suffering for long-term good. There is a startling paradox at play here, difficult to decipher and unravel through only conventional analytical categories.



The impulses for support are varied. Some have faith in Modi’s commitment and the government’s stated vision of ridding India of black money. Some hope this will pump in money into the economy, eventually leading to welfare measures. Some believe it will eventually lead to a drop in prices and corruption.



Others have a more wishful assessment -- greater equality. Yet others are driven by a deep desire to see the rich punished -- and are willing to absorb relative loss as long as the “amir seth (the rich businessman)” is inflicted greater pain.



Sipping tea at the Bihari Dhaba in neighbouring Chunar’s bus stand, Chhotedhar says he managed to deposit old notes and withdraw some money as well. A marginal farmer and a die-hard Bahujan Samaj Party supporter, Chhotedhar desperately needs cash to buy seeds for upcoming planting season but he supports the move.



Chhotedhar is a BSP supporter and a small farmer. He supports demonetisation, says more money will lead to investment in the poor. (HT Photo)



“There is temporary pain. But in a month or two, notes will start coming in and all will be well. People are saying that the money that will be collected from the rich will then be invested in the poor,” he says.



Will people connect with Modi or get upset with him? Chhotedhar takes his time before he says, “Thirty percent will get irritated and 70% will be with him. I am with BSP but this is good work.”



Up ahead in Mirzapur district is the Rajgadh bazaar. At the Kisan Degree Inter College, students have left and the school hall is doubling up as a wedding venue, a common practice in the area.



Read | Demonetisation: Why India’s poor will no longer believe the news



Amit Patel is sitting outside. His brother-in-law’s daughter is getting married. A small businessman, Patel says the demonetisation announcement left them worried, with the wedding just a week away.



“But we managed. We made TV and fridge, tent and catering payments by cheque. And we had to take furniture on credit. I think this is a good move.”



I ask him why?



“I think this will reduce EMIs. Real estate value will come down. And everyone will be forced to do use cheques,” says Patel. Close by, a college teacher, who doesn’t want to be named, is not convinced. He says the government failed to manage the change.



Amit Patel organised a family wedding in the middle of the cash crunch. He believes that the move will reduce interest rates and real estate prices. (HT Photo)



Similar sentiments play out in other districts.



Standing in a bank queue in Jaunpur for more than four hours, an elderly woman says she is in a great deal of difficulty. “I have no money at home. Modi sarkar has started new money.” So, is the government wrong? She responds immediately, “No, the government did the right thing. If big, big people are troubled, how does it matter if I am troubled?”



Another woman, in the same queue, agrees. The government is on the right, it has forced the rich to declare their money. “They made money by suppressing the poor, so what if we have to face some hardship.”



Notes of dissent



Patience, however, is not infinite.



There is a thin line between being upset and angry. Some have crossed that line, a sign that should worry the government.



Sechu Ram is a Dalit who works as a labourer in Delhi’s Azadpur market. Back home in his village in Azamgarh, Ram is angry with Modi. He had to run around to deposit money and faced trouble in organising his niece’s wedding.



His wife speaks up. “If we exchange money they give us a 2,000-rupee note. What will I do with that big note? The government is wrong.” When asked if this would help remove black money, “How do we in villages know what is black money? What does it mean?”



Sechu Ram (left) is a Dalit labourer who struggled to find money. (HT Photo)



Lalitesh Pati Tripathi is the Congress MLA from Mirzapur’s Marihan -- a rural constituency.



He argues the timing of the move has upset farmers. “This is the cash intensive time of the agricultural calendar. They need money for seeds, fertilisers, and daily labour.”



But, they have no money. Cash hasn’t yet come into many cooperative and rural banks for them to even avail the limits set by government. “The smaller farmers will not be able to take credit too.” Right now, Tripathi and his constituents can share a joke about the liquidity crisis. But, he says, it will not take too long for the jokes to turn into anger.



Read | Farmers fear lost crops and income after Modi govt’s demonetisation move



Those on the front-lines of effecting the money switch are worried too.

The Supreme Court on Friday questioned the government’s move to reduce the exchange limit of old notes from Rs 4,500 to Rs 2,000, saying the situation was serious and there could be riots.

The court, which came down hard on the Modi government, also refused its request to put on hold petitions pending in various high courts challenging the decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes that has led to a scramble for cash across the country.

“We asked you to give some relief but you have reduced the exchange limit,” the court said, referring to the previous hearing when it asked the government to ensure that people were not inconvenienced.

“Is there a printing problem?” Chief Justice of India TS Thakur asked attorney general Mukul Rohatgi.

The Centre was facing problem in moving cash to banks, ATMs and post offices, the government’s top law officer said. He also said it was not possible for the government of give Rs 100 notes to everyone.

The government’s surprise decision to scrap high-value currency has led to cash chaos in the country, with snaking queues outside banks and ATMs even after 10 days of the decision. The high-value notes accounted for 86% of the currency in circulation.

Multiple petitions reflected the scale of the problem, the court said, adding it might move pleas pending in various high courts to the one in Delhi.

Adjourning the matter for November 25, it asked the attorney general to move transfer petitions, which the court would consider.

The Centre on Thursday reduced to 2,000 the limit for one-time exchange of old notes in a fresh list of measures to ease the cash crunch.

The government, which has limited cash withdrawals, has struggled to keep up with the demand for cash. Several people have complained that banks were giving them Rs 2,000 notes that were of little use in face of the currency shortage.

Rohatgi also clashed with Kapil Sibal who is representing one of the petitioners to have challenged the demonetisation move. He accused Sibal, a senior Congress leader, of turning the court into a political platform.

As Rohtagi listed steps taken by the government, Sibal said if the AG was to be believed then “there is swarg (heaven) outside”. “I can’t be denied my legitimate money of which the government is a trustee,” Sibal said.

Opposition parties, including the Congress, have accused the Centre of imposing economic emergency. The two sides have clashed in Parliament as well, with the opposition demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who announced demonetisation decision on November 8, be present in the House to answer their queries.

Doesn't that happen in with every PM? For example, do you really think that high level corruption has disappeared under Modi and his ministers aren't ""looting"" the Indian taxpayer? Or the dilution of whistleblower laws are not a part of a deal that Modi has cut with his financiers? Or the fact that zero action has been taken over politicians and celebrities named in HSBC or Panama leaks? Or one of the 100s of examples that I can name?

If you really stick with your principles, there is no way you can become a PM or a senior political figure in this country. Just look at Jayaprakash Narayan of Lok Satta party and see how much success he has got. Or someone such as Prashant Bhushan and the success his new party has. ",2016-11-18 17:18:17

Please notice, I said, 'If it had to be done'. Here again my opinion is different from even the modi-haters, here or in MSM or politics. I have reservations on demonetization itself, but I am happy at the process.

Hong Kong: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream for offshore financial hubs in India to rival Singapore and Hong Kong is attracting interest from currency-derivative designers.

Commercial banks operating in India’s international financial services centers — the first of which will be Gift City in the province of Gujarat that Modi once governed — will be allowed to offer structured products with prior approval from their board of directors, according to Reserve Bank of India rules issued on 10 November. That looks set to allow banks that formerly focused on equity-linked securities to expand into foreign-currency contracts, according to Care Ratings. Ten banks have applied for Gift City licenses, with Yes Bank, ICICI Bank and IDBI Bank among those to receive branch approvals, it said.

“The introduction of these guidelines may pave the way for the emergence of structures with different underlyings such as currency,” said Mukund Upadhyay, manager at Care Ratings.

India’s expanding capital markets need to be able to transact a full range of products to satisfy demand in an economy growing at more than 7% annually, without upsetting the central bank’s control on a depreciating rupee. Modi is building the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City to take some share of the India-related investing and hedging activities from other Asian finance hubs. China is establishing a similar city called Qianhai in Shenzhen, where pilot policies can be tested before being rolled out nationally.

Modi is likely to unveil a 16-story tower at the city near the provincial capital of Ahmedabad in January, Press Trust of India reported last month. The former governor of Gujarat said his “dream” was to create the technology and infrastructure to support “modern India and to create a space in the global financial world,” according to the Gift City Web site

Indian banks setting up units in Gift City are given tax breaks and can more easily offer foreign-currency loans and investments to Indian companies abroad, overseas nationals and foreign companies. Non-resident institutional clients will be the primary source of funds for bank units targeting increased sales of structured products, according to Vivek Sharma, Singapore-based head of asset management for Southeast Asia at Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd.

“Primary customers for these products should emerge as businesses both onshore and offshore which have a significant quantum of foreign-currency dealings with India,” he said in a telephone interview. “Importers and exporters will clearly be a target segment for these products.”

There are currently no structured products linked to the currency in India, according to Care’s Uphadyay. About 93% of products are linked to the Nifty index with the remaining 7% tied to government securities and gold.

As banking units in Gift City are supposed to primarily handle non-rupee business, there is an opportunity to offer foreign currency-linked investment or hedging products that may, for example, take directional bets on the US dollar. This month alone, the rupee has declined 1.4% against the greenback. Over the past five years it is down 25%.

“Corporates trying to borrow in foreign currency and handle this position for import and export purposes will see a visible difference from this rule change,” said Mihir Sundhani, head of the structured solutions group at Reliance Capital Ltd. Bloomberg

___



___



  The Modi government's bold demonetisation move may have taken away India's claim to being the fastest growing economy in the world, with brokerages and economists revising their GDP growth estimates sharply downward as a result of the cash squeeze created in the economy.
  





  Till the other day, the domestic economy was projected to grow at above 7.5 per cent in FY17, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself raising its projections by 0.2 percentage points this October to 7.6 per cent for 2016-17 and also for 2017-18.
  





  In July, World Bank projected India to grow at 7.6 per cent in 2016-17. Rating agency Fitch earlier this year had projected India's real GDP to accelerate to 7.7 per cent in 2016-17 and 7.9 per cent in 2017-18.
  





  The economy expanded at 7.6 per cent in financial year 2015-16, outpacing China for the second year in a row.
  





  Post-demonetisation, GDP growth projections for the Indian economy for FY17 has slipped to as low as 3.5 per cent. In comparison, the Chinese economy has been growing at around 6.7 per cent this year for three quarters in a row.
  





  Broking house Ambit Capital on Friday lowered its FY17 GDP growth forecast for India by 330 basis points, saying it expects GDP growth to decelerate from 6.4 per cent in the first half of FY17 to 0.5 per cent year-on-year in the second half of FY17 with a distinct possibility of GDP growth contracting in the third quarter.
  





  ""The demonetisation-driven cash crunch that is playing out in India will paralyse economic activity in the short term. We expect a strong 'formalisation effect' to play out as nearly half of the non-tax paying businesses in the informal sector (40% share in GDP) will become unviable and cede market share to their organised sector counterparts. We expect this dynamic to crimp GDP growth in India in FY18 as well and hence we have cut our FY18 GDP growth estimate to 5.8 per cent YoY (from 7.3 per cent),"" Ambit economists Ritika Mankar Mukherjee, Sumit Shekhar and Prashant Mittal said in a note.
  





  The analysts have also scrapped their March 2017 Sensex target of 29,500 and pegged their Sensex target for March 2018 at 29,000.
  





  Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist of CARE Ratings, also anticipates a big hit on GDP, but has a little healthier target.
  





  He says India see some pain in the GDP in third quarter as well as fourth quarter, but longer term the recovery is well on track and the economy should recover. ""So FY17 GDP number might come down, but FY18 hopefully will not,"" he said in an interview with ETNow.
  





  ""Earlier we had something like 7.8 per cent (GDP target) for FY17. We still need to work out what exactly would be the impact based on what happens in the next one and a half months. But my own sense is that we will moving more towards the 7.5 per cent range or maybe even lower than that,"" Sabnavis said.
  





  Brokerage Anand Rathi Securities said India's GDP will decline over the next two quarters due to reduction in overall spending. ""After a slow rate of GDP growth for around six months, the subsequent two years could see sharp 'hockey stick' revival in growth,"" it said.

The Narendra Modi-led central government has on several occasions chest-thumped about having changed the fortunes of and Express. Only recently it announced that had made a profit after long. However, it turns out, some part of this profit would have been made by charging booking tickets as much as three times the normal adult airfare across sectors in India.

Thousands of people above the age of 60 years – pensioners, retired people, armed forces personnel and others – use every month. The government-run seems to have charged these people at much higher rates than usual, even as they are entitled to concessionary airfare. What is more disturbing is the fact that most of these elderly people would have booked these ‘exorbitantly priced concessionary tickets’ unsuspectingly.

Particularly hit have been the elderly people travelling long distances. Many who have to spend 36 hours or more to travel by trains usually go for Air India’s concessionary fares to avoid the discomfort of travelling by rail for long distances.

A senior citizen wanting to avail of a concession for flying from Delhi to Chennai on December 12 this year, for example, was offered a “concessionary fare” of Rs 11,053. A normal ticket on the same day for the same flight was priced at Rs 3,647. In effect, the “concessionary fare” for a senior citizen comes to more than three times the normal airfare.

Bookings made for travel two months from now aren’t spared, either. For instance, five routes for travel on January 28, 2017, show similar discrepancies. For flying from Delhi to Kolkata, a senior citizen is asked to pay Rs 10,261, even as a normal ticket on the same route and flight is priced at Rs 3,630.

The story for Delhi-Mumbai flights is hardly different. operates 14 flights between these cities. The normal for a flight on this route is Rs 2,782. But if a senior citizen books the ticket under “concessionary” fare, prices the ticket at Rs 9,991, almost four times the cost of a normal ticket.

Similarly, a normal ticket for a Mumbai-Bengaluru flight on the same day is priced at Rs 2,144. A senior citizen booking on a concession is, however, asked to pay Rs 7,455. A senior citizen flying from Mumbai to Chennai on January 28, 2017, likewise, has to pay Rs 8,705 for a concessionary ticket, compared with the price of Rs 2,780 for a normal ticket on the same route on the same day.

When contacted, an spokesperson said: “Not many avail of concessionary airfare. always plan their journey in advance and don’t fly on an urgent basis. So, the normal fares for them are lower.”

However, a look at the airfares of shows that even if need to fly urgently, doesn’t give them a concession on normal fares. For instance, the normal cost of a ticket on a Delhi-Mumbai flight for November 19 (Saturday) is Rs 6,112. When booked under a senior citizen concession, the same ticket costs Rs 9,991, which is 50% more than normal.

For a senior citizen booking a ticket urgently under the concession, this fact would inevitably escape their attention. It also suggests that has virtually eliminated concessions to senior citizens. The airline’s spokesperson, however, said: “It is wrong to say we don’t have a concession.” He sought to know of a senior citizen who used the facility: “Show me any senior citizen who uses the concession.”

An email was also sent to the management seeking details of the number of who booked under the concession category on a higher without realising that the normal fares were lower. The email had not been unanswered till the time of going to press.

270,"#Notes Ban: Problem Is Serious, We Will Have Riots, Says Supreme Court

___

[IMAGE 1](http://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-11/atm-queues_650x400_51479458680.jpg)

___

New Delhi:  For the second time in a week, the Centre has faced tough questions on the notes ban from the Supreme Court, which cautioned on Friday: ""We will have riots on the streets.""



Chief Justice of India TS Thakur said petitions challenging the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes indicate the magnitude of the problem.



""You have scrapped 500 and 1,000, but what happened to the 100 rupee note?"" the Chief Justice asked the government, referring to the daily scramble for cash across the country and the punishing queues outside banks and ATMs.



ATMs, the government replied, need to be recalibrated because they have a ""single drawer"" for Rs 100 notes. For thousands, this has meant that cash dried up long before they could reach the top of the line after several hours.



The court had more questions on the currency ban announced suddenly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 to check tax evasion and black or untaxed money. In the past 10 days, there have been several additional announcements to ease the crisis for people.



""The last time you said you are working out relief but you have reduced the withdrawal amount to 2,000. What's the problem? Is it a printing problem?"" Justice Thakur asked the government.



The government earlier this week reduced the Rs 4,500 limit for the exchange of notes at banks to Rs 2,000, saying it would enable more people to get cash.



Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said: ""Not only printing... it has to be transported to lakhs of branches across the country and ATMs have to re-calibrated.""



Mr Rohatgi added that the government did grant relief to farmers, families planning weddings and small traders.



Representing one of the petitioners, senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, a senior Congress leader, alleged that people in villages and in the northeastern states are unable to withdraw money.



The government lawyer retorted: ""Mr Sibal is making a political issue here. You can't convert this court into a political platform. Let him go outside and address people as a Congress person.""

Courage is often a misunderstanding of suicide or gamble. It appears that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose devotees are celebrating his “boldness” for delegitimising large bills, has in fact made a calculated gamble. And it is turning out to be an excellent move. He has already gotten away with it, only the extent of his rewards is unclear.

This may not be apparent at first glance, especially if you are not very fond of him. There are communism-grade queues outside banks, which do not have enough cash to distribute. For the first time an Indian economic crisis is not about people being broke but about their inability to reach their sufficient or abundant money. There are stories of the old dying in the queues, the poor distraught, restaurants and malls bleeding, commercial sex workers unemployed.

There is no doubt that the citizens are furious, but they will not punish Modi for it. He did suspect that. He may not have been so confident about inflicting demonetisation in the summer months when people, especially in north India are prone to violence.

Even though people have suffered greatly, and many have lost portions of their hard-earned illicit money, it is hard to dispute that the government has performed a moral act. Surprisingly, the government has been able to communicate the reasonable message widely and deeply. It is rare for people to have an accommodating view of a sudden policy that only has long-term benefits, especially one that has hurt them. But there is observable evidence that the general public is with Modi on this.

The hostile reactions to the cash crunch are understandable and worthy of respect, but some of the anger should amuse us. It reminds me of the men who used to burn the effigies of cricketers, including Sachin Tendulkar’s, after an Indian defeat. Journalists usually portrayed such extreme reactions as emotional outbursts of fans. In reality most of the effigy-burning was performed by bettors who had lost money on their emotional backing of India. Reactions to the demonetisation, too, contain the grief of hoarders clinging on to honourable reasons to be angry, reasons that they probably even believe to be true.

An unknown portion of India’s unrecorded economy is run by politics. Parties receive cash through illegal means, which they then spend on illegitimate or nefarious activities, which include efforts to win elections. The important question is why does Modi’s BJP need less black money than other political parties? Is the party comparatively cleaner, or does it have more sophisticated systems in place, systems that a Putin would recognise? We will go there another day.

Read | There’s little connection between cash in economy and corruption

One strand of the moral outrage against demonetisation has been led by the refined urban class that dislikes Modi. They are excited by any story that assures them that Modi has made a catastrophic mistake. The reason why the story about the new Rs2,000 notes bleeding colour received good play in the social media even after the government pointed out that the notes are meant to lose colour, and that if they don’t they are counterfeit.

There is something clownish about the urban middle class. They keep whining about the state of the nation but when powerful solutions appear they reject them. They reject them because they are as corrupt and harmful as the aspects of the nation they despise.

Not long ago they prayed for a clean, highly-educated politician who was not the genetic material of political dynasties; but when Arvind Kejriwal miraculously made an appearance they loved him only till he was a gadfly fast-until-orange-juice activist. When he turned out to be a sharp politician they suddenly wished to dismiss him as an “anarchist”. In Delhi they keep whining about pollution but they do not tolerate any inconvenience to their car travel. Their grumblings about demonetisation are in line. Their lament cloaks the immediate prospect of the policy as a highly effective and even popular measure.

Read | Demonetisation: Kejriwal says PM Modi using his mother for politics

A war against cash hoarding and illicit cash flow is also a war against disorder and informality, which means it is a war against two central qualities of the Indian way of life. Such wars against the Indianness of Indians can be destructive to politicians who wage them. But there can be great rewards, too, to those who take a chance. Some people may have theorised that the Delhi Metro, which sought to ban Indians from spitting and littering, would be defeated by rampaging mobs. Instead, commuters ended up appreciating how the Metro constricted their exceptional freedoms as Indians. It is highly likely that Indians would exhibit such a capacity for appreciation for Modi’s attempt to end an economic disorder. Also, he knows how to spin every economic good news in the coming months as a consequence of demonetisation.

It is tempting to imagine what would have happened if the Congress government had taken the same step. Or say, if the Aam Aadmi Party, if it had been at the Centre, had made the move?

It may have been disastrous because of how the parties are perceived by the people. Modi, for now, has the charm to get away with many reforms that other politicians and parties cannot. We must use this man to get some difficult things done.

278,"&gt; The documents that were seized during the raids are appear to have been **signed by Ankita Pandey, deputy director, Income Tax (Investigation)** and counter-signed by other government officials along with a representative from the Sahara India Group. **When I spoke to Pandey over the phone on 3 November, she said she was on a long leave. She added that she was not authorised to speak to the media and could, therefore, neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the documents.**

&gt; The documents form a part of an Interim Application (IA) that has been filed by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Common Cause, in its pending petition challenging the appointment of Kosaraju Veerayya Chowdary, the chief vigilance commissioner of India since June 2015. The organisation filed this IA on 15 November 2016.  It is being **represented by the lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who had earlier written letters to nine individuals**, attaching copies of some of the documents that had been seized during the raid on the Sahara India Group. Bhushan sent these letters, with detailed annexures, in the course of the last week of October.
&gt; 
&gt; In his letters, Bhushan asked each of these offices why various law-enforcing agencies of the government had not initiated action against those whose names feature in the documents and have allegedly acquired assets disproportionate to known sources of income. **He claimed that different wings of the government were sitting tight on important documents indicating “bribery” and “corruption”** even as the accused persons and firms were attempting to strike conciliatory agreements with the tax authorities through the Settlement Commission.

&gt; I first learnt about the existence of these documents on 28 July 2016 from the member of parliament and well-known lawyer Ram Jethmalani, who was expelled from the BJP in May 2013. During an informal conversation that followed a panel discussion at the  India International Centre in Delhi, **Jethmalani told me—in the presence of around half-a-dozen individuals (including a Rajya Sabha MP from the BJP)—that the documents that had been seized by income tax officials from the offices of the Sahara India Group were “explosive”** as they suggested that Modi had received huge cash payments. I repeatedly asked the 93-year-old lawyer if he would show me the documents but he was non-committal. A number of phone calls to him over the next few weeks elicited no response.

&gt; I subsequently discovered, that on 28 June, Jethmalani had writted to Satyendar Jain, minister in the government of the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. Jethmalani had attached the documents recovered from the raid and a copy of an official letter that the income tax officer Ankita Pandey had signed in December 2015, with a request to verify whether the signatures on the two sets of papers belonged to the same person. On 1 July, **Anurag Sharma, assistant director (Documents), Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Government of the NCT of Delhi, wrote to G Sudhakar, the secretary to Jain, stating that the signatures on the two documents “appear to be written by one and the same person”.**",2016-11-18 18:13:50

  These banks enjoy good customer base in various areas, particularly in the ‘sugarcane belt’ of Meerut, Saharanpur and Muzaffarpur.

Aditya Yadav, chair man of UP’s Provincial Cooperative Federation (PCF) that provides seeds, fertilisers and other agricultural inputs to farmers, said the withdrawal of '500 and '1,000 denomination notes has created a lot of problems for farmers as it’s the “buwai” (sowing) season.

  Farmers are up in arms against the restriction on DCBs. Members of Bharat Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee are expected to meet the prime minister on the issue and have warned if the decision is not rolled back they may protest nationwide.  

 

  Punjab has 12,673 villages and farmers largely deposit their earnings from produce in cooperative banks. “This is a major setback to the farming community.  

 

  The development has actually scuttled the entire purpose of cooperative movement and these banks were set up to help farmers,” said Bhupinder Singh Maan, president of BKU.

  While nationally one-third of short term loan and crops loans to farmers are given out by cooperative banks, in Odisha DCBs account for two-thirds of such loans.  

 

  Hence, the RBI restriction on DCBs will hit farmers here hard, experts said. “The state is in the middle of kharif harvest season, it is going to be hard to make labour payments in Rs 100, and I don’t see farmers moving to Paytm in three months,” said a senior official with obvious sarcasm.  

 

  Agriculture economists and officials said mandis and traders are exploiting farmers by forcing them to either accept demonetised notes or charge less for their produce, leading to significant increase in distress sale.

 By Dhurjoti Bhattacharya

  With the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes hitting the rural economy the hardest, cooperative banks in Gujarat are on the warpath over the decision to restrain them from accepting old notes. And here the movement is led by BJP leaders.  

 

  “More than 50% of the farmers are linked with the DCBs across the country,” said Dilip Sanghani, a BJP heavyweight from Saurashtra.  

 

  “It is strange that while other banks are carrying out the exchange and accepting deposits, DCBs have been barred from doing so. Imagine the plight of a farmer who has just sold his crop.  

 

  He can’t deposit his money in the bank he holds account in, can’t exchange notes which are no more valid, and is stranded in the middle of the season in want of money to saw the crop, buy fertiliser or employ labour despite having money in his hand,” said Sanghani who is chairman of National Federation of State Cooperative Banks.  

 

  The market yards of Saurashtra region have been shut for unspecified period. A committee of 11 members from the various market yards will soon approach the chief minister and the Union government to resolve the cash crisis.

  Business has come to a grinding halt in hundreds of cooperative banks that play an important role in Kerala, having total business of more than '1 lakh crore. CM Pinarayi Vijayan and other ministers will go on a satyagraha in front of the RBI office in Thiruvananthapuram in protest as his meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley did not lead to a positive decision of such banks.  

 

  Opposition UDF has also extended its support to the government.  

 

  For primary cooperative banks at grass-root level, the demonetisation drive has cut the deposit and credit facility with the district cooperative banks.  

 

  By law these banks are supposed to deposit their excess cash with the district cooperative banks. But the RBI has now fixed their withdrawal limit at '24,000 per week (Rs 50,000 per week for current accounts), said A K Purushothaman, GM, Kannur district cooperative bank. Now these banks are facing customer ire.

283,"[K.C. Chakrabarty, who was deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) between June 2009 and March 2014, said that there was no economic rationale behind the ongoing demonetisation drive and that such a proposal had been floated by the UPA govt, we said NO](http://www.thehindu.com/business/upa-government-also-proposed-it-we-said-no/article9357895.ece?)

First, this lends more credibility to the fact we've discussed here - MODI surrounds himself with Yes Men. If you don't agree with him, you get booted out. [Rajan didn't seem to agree with Modi's Tuglaqian Drive](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/11/09/heres-what-raghuram-rajan-thinks-of-currency-demonetisation/) and quit before he could be made a Yes Man - I seriously applaud his guts, 'I'd rather quit than agree to your barbarian ideas!'

Second, it also lends credibility to the political equation, albeit jocular, BJP = Congress + Cow. You just rehash what the previous UPA govt has planned and try to make it yours by coining some fancy terms like Surgical Strike!

Third, just how many U-Turns (a simple google search will tell you just how many ranging from Budget and Fiscal Policies, 
Dilution of Democratic Institutions, Subsidies and Price Hikes, Laws and Foreign Policies to Individual Politicians!) have we seen from BJP so far! The latest ones Adhaar - vehemently opposed but forcefully implemented without any proper understanding of its ramifications, Demonetisation - passionately opposed on the idea that common man will suffer and yet silently pushed down the throat of every Indian - where is your concern for common man now?",2016-11-18 18:24:59
284,"Where are the scams? EVERY SINGLE govt till NDA II has been hit with financial scams bar none, 

* UPA - no need to get into the details, we all know.
* NDA I - Coffin Scam, Op West End all touched the highest levels (though Fernandez was later exonerated in the Coffingate),
* Rao - Chandraswamy, bribery of legislators, Sugar import scam,
* Rajiv - Bofors. Nuff said,
* Indira - Maruthi Technical Services scam, and later the absurd bending of rules to set up Maruthi automobiles
* Nehru - Dalmia Scam and Haridas Mundra Scam (Feorze Gandhi was the Prashanth Bhushan and SuSu of his day in taking on scamsters...pity we lost him early)

In this case what? Lalit Modi ""scam""? We have nothing, and it is not sufficient to say ""I know scams are taking place, I just know it"". High level corruption at the cabinet level HAS disappeared for all intents and purposes. Forget being chargesheeted or a case going to court (as all the above cases did), literally nothing has come out, but it is interesting how this is also seen as ""Modi is clever"". Your post smacks of that also in all honesty.

While I agree that the amendment of the Whistleblowers bill is over reach, how is it a part of the deal that Modi has cutwith his financiers? What does this even mean? This is the kind of...baseless agenda mongering that actually dilutes meaningful protests or logic driven counter arguments to such bills.

So you are saying that Modi and Adani cut a deal where Modi will dilute the WB act so Adani can go about killing people? This is some House of Cards level conspiracy - I have exaggerated for effect to prove a point.

&gt; Or the fact that zero action has been taken over politicians and celebrities named in HSBC or Panama leaks? 

Again, much hyperbole in the media has obfuscated this. On what basis can a democracy take action against people for holding an offshore account? Is it illegal or unconstitutional to hold an offshore account? What kind of action do you expect to be taken?  The money is offshore, we don't even know how much money, but for the sin of holding an offshore account, should these people be jailed?

Mind you, am not saying that the BJP or Modi is some super clean entity. They are not. In fact, I firmly believe (apropos of any objective evidence) that the SIMI encounter is a sophisticated method of fanning the communal embers. Riots are old school, instead let us just fucking execute 6 boys in cold blood and then chest thump in UP at how strong we are. However even this is based on facts surrounding the incident not something as baseless as Modi crony capitalist for Paytm.

Principles are different from being an utter sell out. Was Rao a principled politician? No. But he got shit done.

To watch as you couldn't even nominate your own cabinet, or to watch as files were delivered to 10 Janpath first before being sent to the PMO, to just sit and watch cabinet thugs like A Raja swindle the country or while Maran literally threatened businessmen is not being unprincipled, it is called cowardice and loyalty to family above all.

If Mr Singh had lied, cajoled and pushed bills, your argument will hold. If Mr Singh had played the Chankyan game of politics, pushed out thugs like A Raja, your argument would hold. If he told Sonia to fuck off from micro managing or he would quit, your argument would hold. Mr Singh was a sell out, forget principles, he first needed a backbone.",2016-11-18 18:29:11

New Delhi:  Arvind Kejriwal, among the most voluble critics of the ban on 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, has said ""it is anti-national to support demonetisation in (its) current form"".



Mr Kejriwal, who is the Chief Minister of Delhi, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiative to combat black money is designed to fail. Those who are honest and poor are waiting in lines at banks, he told NDTV, while ""those with black money are getting the new notes home-delivered to them"".



Last week, PM Modi in a surprise televised address said that just hours later, high-denomination notes would be illegal for transactions. The sudden announcement has been followed by winding queues at banks and ATMs as people scramble to access the new Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 notes.



""This Rs. 2,000 note...you tell me. How will it change black money?"" Mr Kejriwal asked. ""The man who packed his briefcase with 1,000-rupee notes at will now stocks half the notes (but adding up to the same amount) as he heads to pay a bribe,"" he alleged. ""Aren't we seeing how bribes are already being found in the new (2000-rupee) bills?""



Together with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the Delhi politician has demanded the rollback of the notes ban, which the government has flatly ruled out.



Objecting to criticism that his stand on the currency reboot is forged in a habitual hostility towards the PM, Mr Kejriwal said, ""When he has done good things, we have backed him. We swept the streets with him for his Clean India mission, brought our mats to do yoga with him to mark and popularize International Yoga Day.""



""Of course, black money must be fought and removed. We will back any robust move for this,"" he said, ""but how will this be effective?""



Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party grew out of a vast anti-corruption campaign led by activist Anna Hazare in 2012. ""Nobody has fought corruption on behalf of this country like us,"" said the Chief Minister.



""It would be anti-national"" to back the reform as is, he said, using a phrase that critics of the BJP say it levels indiscriminately and too frequently against those who question its policies.



The BJP has dismissed Mr Kejriwal's comments. ""Kejriwal's nationalism and patriotism is the kind that is revered in Pakistan... he discounts the bravery of our soldiers posted at the border, makes dangerous claims...We don't take his comments on nationalism seriously because his own priorities are highly suspect,"" said the BJP's GVL Narasinha Rao.



In the first week after the notes were outlawed, nearly 50 billion dollars were deposited in banks. Individuals have till the end of the year to turn in the old notes.

287,"In this timeline, India saw itself as the successor state of British India and hence naturally expected (as is historic tradition) that the borders (and its agreements) signed by the previous state pass over.  

(I won't go further in this, but this position of India was wrong on multiple facets, which aren't specific to your question at the moment)

This is why India behaved liked it did post Independence.  
After the war in 1962 things changed, its a very big event in India(in China its not even a fraction of that in relevance). India became insular on this, it HAD to protect its claims for its own sanity.  
Then multiple generations grew up. In the backdrop a certain narrative developed which was not positive towards China. And naturally it became harder and harder to solve the border.   

Now the problem is Political (its been political for at least 3 decades). This Modi Govt was the first Single party Govt of India in 3 decades.  
The idea/suggestion that India can take part in an agreement with any State (let alone China) a land exchange deal is misunderstanding the on ground reality.  
India took 4 decades to even enter negotiations with a friendly country in Bangladesh to have a land exchange deal.  

China has a track record of dealing with this subject matter. India does not and its not for China only, its for EVERYONE of India's neighbors, big or small. There was a similar thing with Sri Lanka even.  

India-China border is what it is because of Indian Political and Systemic issues.  
Pre-Modi in the last 3 decades, India could not have settled the border EVEN IF its Govt wanted it because it had no legitimacy and consensus to make that happen.  

In a comment further down you mentioned that you read Xi and some land exchange being barriers.  
From what i have read, the specifics of border demarcation has been done in the insane amounts of Border-Talk rounds that have taken place in the last decade. Its the next stage which is now the hurdle, the bureaucratic and then the Political.  
China has already mentioned they would not disturb populated regions in any land exchange, even if Tawang was to be exchanged it would be because even the Tibetans consider it theirs. But i doubt from what the stories are coming out in recent times that its an issue anymore.  
The ball is and has ALWAYS been in India's court. It has to mobilize its political forces and prepare its populace and media for a land exchange, after generations of telling its people that that land was inseparable part of India.  

Most Chinese aren't even aware about how much land it has given away in the 12 Land Border Ratifications it did with its neighbors.  
India is a victim of its System on this issue and hence the delay and the position it holds.",2016-11-18 18:41:11
288,"Relevant WhatsApp group forward I received,not sure if it's been posted here already:

""How can PM Knew URJIT PATEL WILL B GOVERNOR SIX MONTHS BACK.

Urjit Patel governor RBI has signed 2000/- notes.

How did he signed njotes 6 months back. He was appointed in Sept only.

How much New Notes of Rs. 2000/- &amp; also Rs. 500/- Printed ??

What is Time Process to approve &amp; Print ??

What is our Capacity to Print Notes.... ?

How New RBI Gov. Urjit Patel sign on notes when Government said It has started Printing since Six Month.... When he was appointed only on 4th September 2016.. ???

Today I went to the bank and collected the brand new 2000rs notes.When I turned over the note I found something peculiar. The RBI governor's signature had the name Urjit Patel on it. The announcement by Modi clearly said the printing and preparations began 6 months ago. Urjit Patel was appointed September end.Urjit Patel, former employee of Reliance. So then was the decision to sack Raghuram Rajan already taken six months ago and his replacement chosen. More importantly,was he sacked bcoz he asked banks to declare their NPAs (non performing assets or bad debts). What are these huge NPAs crippling the banks ? Loans taken by corporate fatcats like Ambanis, Adanis etc who among them have taken lakhs of crores as loans never to be returned to the public. The banks were cash strapped and the financial genius Raghuram Rajan's medicine was to declare losses and start afresh.He was sacked unceremoniously.So, my question is, did this move to demonetise the currency( 86 percent of all currency in circulation is 500 and 1000 rs.) a move help Ambani Bhai and their friends?¿???

294,"&gt; Sorry, the scams in all the previous cases broke out during the first term.

Wrong. 2G spectrum scam was exposed by a CAG audit in 2011. Coal scam was exposed in 2012. Please get basic facts correct and don't make up shit.

Also, reading Gujarat, were you living under a rock in the 2014 elections. Here you go - just a sample http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/adani-group-got-land-at-cheapest-rates-in-modi-s-gujarat-114042501228_1.html

&gt; The rates at which the Gautam Adani-promoted Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state. Concessional pricing apart, the group did not face land acquisition hurdles, as the state allotted non-agricultural government land for Adani Port and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), the country’s largest multi-product SEZ spread across 15,946.32 acres (6,456 hectares) in Kutch district’s Mundra block.

&gt; By comparison, other companies setting up facilities in the state paid much higher rates: Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt. Among other industrial groups, K Raheja Corp was sold land at Rs 470 per sq mt, while TCS had to pay at Rs 1,100 per sq mt and Torrent Power at Rs 6,000 per sq mt. (one acre equals 4,046.86 square metres).",2016-11-18 18:58:20

&gt;* In yet another shameful incident shedding light on the increasing cases of sexual abuse of children, a 72-year-old retired professor has been booked for allegedly raping six minor girls living at a government-aided orphanage, while his daughter, who ran it, has been arrested today.

&gt;* S Shukla, an officer of Women and Child Development department, got suspicious during a routine counselling of the orphans some weeks ago.

&gt;* She called them for another round of counselling in presence of District Collector O P Shrivastava and other officers concerned yesterday, Davis said.

&gt;* An FIR was lodged against Agrawal and his daughter under relevant sections of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act late last night, police said.

&gt;* The data accumulated by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reveals that at least 34, 651 cases of rape were reported across India in 2015, in which the victims ranged from female children younger than six years old to women over 60 years.

With the demonetisation decision playing out as a political war in Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was widely expected to attend the Global Citizen’s India event in Mumbai on Saturday, is now likely to give it a miss.

Until Friday morning, there had been no communication from the prime minister’s office on Modi participating in the event. The event organisers as well as the chief minister’s office have so far got no confirmation about the PM’s visit.

The event is being partnered by the state government and it was expected that the PM, who was present for the Global Citizen festival in New York in 2014, would lend his brand to this social platform, which amplifies some of his favourite causes — such as sanitation. Riding on this, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also planned to get the PM to lay the foundation stones for two of the proposed metro corridors in the city and, thus, informally launch the poll campaign for the BMC elections due next year.

“With the political slug fest over the demonetisation drive, PM may not want to be seen at the festival that is being headlined by an international pop-rock band and has a host of Bollywood celebrities in attendance even though the event is meant to garner support and funds for social causes,” said a senior BJP leader. “It will only give the Opposition (reason) to criticise the PM as being elitist when many common citizens are still in queue to withdraw cash.”

Last week, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) officials were preparing for ‘bhoomi pujan’ for the metro lines, while the party unit was looking at holding a public meeting at Somaiya ground in Ghatkopar. However, on Friday, the MMRDA said the planned event was not taking place on Saturday.

The Global Citizen India event ran into controversy over the issue of the state government waiving entertainment tax for the Cold Play concert here on Saturday. Social activists Anjali Damania and Hemant Gawande moved court through a Public Interest Litigation. The court, however, refused to stay the event.

The scrapping of Rs 1,000 and 500 notes ahead of the local self government polls in the state is likely to impact the elections, with the unorganised and agrarian sector being hit by the move. The BJP, however, is hoping the drive that is increasingly being seen through a rich-versus-poor prism will end up giving the party dividends in the local elections even if it is at the cost of losing the party’s core trader base.

The Prime Minister is expected to sound the bugle for the high decibel Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls later this month or early in December.

&gt;* If the process and people are not changed a person can use currency, gold, other assets for black money generation.

&gt;* There will be a liquidity crunch, volume of transactions will go down, sometimes it may totally collapse, depending on the situation.

&gt;* We consider that black money does not generate any second or third order benefit to government, but if a person goes with black money and spends it in the malls, restaurants or cinema hall then government gets a part of the tax.

Also, Modi won more because of an anti-congress and lack of a strong leader in the opposition party than his own merit. I'm not taking away Modi's thunder but it is true that anti-incumbency was a huge factor in his win in the elections. 

Since the announcements, media has reported 55 deaths. Agreed some might be fake/planted but dismissing all stories as fake and planted is ridiculous. For me, the buck stops with death. As has been discussed on this thread (or a previous one) there were many easier and effective ways to deal with black money which would have unearthed more money too instead of this paltry black money sum in cash. For me, the government has big time blundered. 

Don't tell me that I support corruption. I don't. But the way this has been implemented, there are definitely ulterior motives (the elections and the weak conditions of banks). It is sad that most of our population is not in a position to analyze the situation completely. ",2016-11-18 22:25:09

An ambitious road connectivity plan involving Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) --- an initiative pushed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost trade --- has hit a roadblock with the upper house of Bhutan parliament deciding against ratifying the motor vehicle pact on Wednesday.

The BBIN agreement – signed in Bhutan’s capital Thimpu in July – will become operational only when all the four countries ratify it. India, Bangladesh and Nepal have already ratified the pact.

The pact will allow seamless movement of passenger and cargo vehicles among the four countries. Under the agreement, the “contracting parties” will allow cargo vehicles for inter-country cargo, including third country cargo and passenger vehicles or personal vehicles, to ply in the territory of another country “subject to the terms of the agreement”.

All vehicles, however, will require a permit for plying through the other country.

This is the second time that the Indian government’s sub-regional road connectivity plan has hit a hurdle. Earlier, Pakistan scuppered the Saarc motor vehicle agreement by refusing to come on board.

India then decided to tap its eastern neighbours to boost regional connectivity. Bypassing Pakistan, India moved to have an agreement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan to remove restrictions on vehicular movement in the subcontinent.

Senior government officials in the Union road transport and highways ministry said a large cross-section of people in Bhutan, including lawmakers, had expressed concerns over the environmental impact of allowing large number of vehicles enter the country after it ratifies the pact.

“The lower house of Bhutan parliament had approved the pact earlier this year. But on Wednesday, the upper house (National Council) decided against it. This might derail the entire plan as any restrictions which are beyond the reasonable won’t be accepted by the other member countries,” said a senior ministry official who did not want to be quoted.

India is in a bilateral motor vehicle agreement with Nepal and Bangladesh, but a multilateral pact would go a long way in boosting trade in the region.

A release issued by the National Council of Bhutan said on Wednesday that the Upper House voted on the agreement following thorough deliberations after its legislative committee pointed out its general as well as specific reservations on the pact. Of the 20 members present and voting, two members voted for the ratification of the agreement, while 13 voted against it and five abstained.

Officials familiar with the developments say Bhutan has been pushing for a cap on vehicles entering its territory for some time. Such discussions came up during the transport officials’ meeting in Dhaka in March.

347,"Alcohol prohibition in India

---

&gt;* Alcohol prohibition in India is in force in the states of Gujarat, Kerala, Bihar,Nagaland and Manipur; as well as in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep.

&gt;* On 24 August 2014, the Chief Minister Oommen Chandy announced, after a long persuasion from KPCC President V M Sudheeran, that state will implement prohibition in a phased manner.

&gt;* [7] In 2016 new Chief Minister of Kerala said their studies show total ban is not applicable but they will enforce on regulating alcohol consumption.

&gt;* The proposed plan is to regulate alcohol consumption using Aadhaar cards to a maximum of 14 units[10] per week, as studies show it decreases rising cancer risk and liver disease.

&gt;* On that date, the state Legislative Assembly passed the Mizoram Liquor (Prohibition and Control) Bill 2014 (or MLPC), replacing the MLTP Act.

NEW DELHI: In the midst of a heated political debate overscrapping of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes+, PMNarendra Modihas suggestedstate funding of polls, along with simultaneous Lok Sabha andassembly elections, to improve transparency in public life and combat corruption.



Poll: Is PM Modi's idea of state funding of elections feasible?



The PM told an all-party meeting on Tuesday that he hoped a discussion in Parliament on demonetisation would send out a ""positive message"" that the political class was capable of acting for the good of the people rather than conveying a negative message.



The PM's comments found the support of Trinamool Congress's Sudip Bandopadhyay, who said he had raised the same point just ahead of Modi joining the all-party deliberations. The PM said he hoped the issue would be fully debated.



The PM's move to bring up state funding at a time when the decision to scrap old currency is being bitterly debated is seen as a step to push the transparency agenda, as elections and political parties are closely associated withblack money+.



Though not a new idea, Modi's pitch that state funding, along with simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections, will curb poll expenditure and make the process cleaner seems a bid to link demonetisation with wider political reforms.



Collection of unaccounted money by leaders and parties has often been cited as the root of political corruption as it leads to post-election favours being granted to poll financiers. State funding has been touted as a possible antidote.

352,"The morality of binaries

---

&gt;* Addressing public functions in Goa, Belgavi and Pune on Sunday, he sought to turn the entire narrative about demonetisation into one about himself, his political career, and the unfairness of being persecuted by powerful enemies.

&gt;* In other words, the one who truly deserves sympathy in the present scenario is not the mass of daily wagers, street vendors, and farmers whose already precarious livelihoods have been disrupted, but Mr. Modi.

&gt;* Anyone who has been out in the past few days queuing up outside ATMs could not have failed to come across people from every strata, but especially the lower middle classes, who, while acknowledging the hardship they are going through, nonetheless believe that Mr. Modi has taken a bold step for the good of the country.

&gt;* When he says, I promise you I will give you the India which you desired I am doing what I was asked to do by the people of this country, not only do a large number of Indians believe him, their words supply meaning to their hardship by wrapping it in a narrative that connects them to a larger cause, and makes them feel good about themselves.

&gt;* Hence the bear hug of Barack Obama, Francois Hollande, Tony Abbott, and their ilk, extendable to other larger-than-life members of the global power elite such as Mark Zuckerberg or Hugh Jackman.

&gt; * Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar , finance minister Arun Jaitley and urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu were present in the meeting.Meanwhile, the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day after a relentless opposition demanded moving an adjournment motion to discuss theissue.As soon as the House met for the day, leader of congress in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge demanded that the issue of scrapping of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 denomination notes be discussed through an adjournment motion and not the rule proposed by the government.Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said the government was willing to discuss the issue and there was no need to press for an adjournment motion.As he said the entire nation was with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of demonetisation, a united opposition raised slogans and rushed into the Well.Members of Congress, TMC and Left parties were seen in the Well.

354,"&gt;I just want to ask all those critics who are feeling so much pain for the poor

Are the poor even complaining? My rural cousins barely felt it, for them it's mostly an urban drama. 

As for me, I live in a fairly populous part of Bangalore. Withdrawing money wasn't really agni-parikhsa. My mom and I went to the bank, it was crowded as fuck with a lot of confused customers and annoyed bank clerks. Deposited cash into my account. Withdrew about 25k in cash. All done in less than 2 hours. 

If you can't even stand  for 2 hours I don't know what to tell you. The bureaucracy in this country is slow as fuck, I stood at the RTO queue for 2 hours just for ""data entry"". Haven't you guys ever stood in  long queues? 

From my PoV, the only people who have a problem with this are those who have black money and are feeling the pinch. Or bleeding heart people who have never stepped outside their comfort zones - and these people overlap with the ""hate Modi blindly"" crowd.

364,"&gt; yes and no. every single ....
 In that way, every single note of any denomination the RBI ever put out was already part of the ""formal banking infrastructure"".

i'm not sure about this,but why do you propose that every rupee was deposited in a bank account?
not to mention the bank details of the old days,recorded on paper and not necessarily shared with the Govt are much different from the present state,where not only banks are required to report certain transaction,but they(Govt) themselves can and will audit the accounts of people with the help of PAN cards and Aadhar card.and having the amount of notes in their books doesn't equate to it being in the ""formal banking sector""
&gt; that happened the very first time the note was printed and let loose in the wild.

great way to put it out of context again.it is hard to have a conversation when everything has to be spelled out.
i am saying that the money will be in the people's accounts,not the RBI's.
 &gt; if it leaked, it is criminal on Modi's part regardless of whether anybody took advantage of it or not.

not really.criminal on what grounds?for it to be fraud,there has to be same profit that is raked by either Modi or his associates
but i agree,if the leak happened,the Govt is on a slippery slope.my point was that deposits in bank are not valid proof.
&gt; they already don't. but again, this is a different debate. has nothing to do with present situation.

they don't allow people to withdraw cash in as much volume as they want?they would maybe require PAN card and other stuff,but i don't think there is any limit on the amount of cash you can withdraw.

and about your argument of the effectiveness of this scheme,this was never a part of the coversation so i don't why you bring it up,but let me respond to you anyways

370,"&gt;any source or just rough estimates

*sigh*.  the 80-20 rule (The Pareto principle) is a concept that has stood the test of time.  So has the bell curve.  there's reams and reams of research and reportage on the income inequality in India and rest of the world.  There are metrics like Gini coefficient which show India cut a sorry figure.  Even anecdotally speaking, the Reddys and their extended family of thugs probably have more black money than the rest of the population in the entire district.  I could ask you to spend 5 minutes on Google, but what's the point?  I did it myself....

here's a report from The Hindu - 
http://www.thehindu.com/data/indias-staggering-wealth-gap-in-five-charts/article6672115.ece

from the report - 

&gt;India’s 1 per centers – its super-rich – have been getting richer even faster. In the early 2000s, India’s top 1 per cent held a lower of share of India’s total wealth than the world’s top 1 per cent held of its total wealth. That changed just before and after the global recession – though the world’s super-rich are recovering - and India’s top 1% holds close to half of the country’s total wealth.

Further it states, the top 10% own roughly 80% of all the wealth.  And here's the kicker... this report is talking of legitimate wealth.  The skewing on the illicit wealth is going to be far worse.  And my guesstimate would not be far off the mark.


&gt;no.if nobody can touch you(hyperbole),you will most likely have your black money in other sources.

yes.  it is also well known that cash is perhaps the smallest component of the black economy.  And which is why the big fish are the least hit.  The big fish in any case do keep some cash for liquidity especially around the time of elections etc.,.  So they didn't lose big, if at all.

&gt;maybe big companies,but i doubt individuals and small to medium companies will take risks like this which just dent their reputation and risk Jail

there is no dent to any reputation.  it is not like every income-tax case on every small to medium businessman is news.  There's millions of such cases rotting in our courts right now and nobody has had a dent in their ""reputation"" nor in jail.  also, it is not even about fighting tooth and nail... it is about getting adjournments for years together.  a half-decent lawyer fresh out of any law school will be able to get you that.


&gt;that's not something new,it can hardly be even called tax evasion.

right.  that's hardly even evasion (it is) but it would be an annoyance to me.  I would have to spend time and calories and a modicum of stress to pull it off.  instead, if you'd left me alone, I'd still have just spent it on paying for incidentals and spent it on the local economy.  Now, my money has to take a serpentine trip to the bank, into RBI's books and then when they deign to allow me to get my hands on my own money, I will have to spend it on something.

there is also another  issue with paying taxes in India.  if the government wasn't so corrupt and so inefficient to the point of being a virtual blackhole, i would not really mind paying taxes all that much.  if we got good roads, clean air, water and garbage-free roads, I wouldn't think twice about paying taxes.  But since I don't get any of that, I don't even feel guilty of not paying taxes.

Just saw somewhere that 8000 wilful defaulters owe the govt., 76,000 crores.  What is preventing Modi from going after them and seizing their assets?  *That* would be ""surgical strike"" I can get behind.  Instead of that, the common man who owes probably 5k in taxes has his life turned upside down and lectured on making ""sacrifices"" for the country.",2016-11-19 04:26:31

372,"Q to Modi on behalf of my local *panipuriwala* -

My panipuri guy makes the greatest panipuris in the world.  I frequently go to him when I need my daily or weekly fix.  Now, the guy sells panipuris for Rs. 15 a plate.  His cost price is probably not more than Rs. 5 per plate.  He sells at least 100 plates on a normal night and on weekends he could sell 500 or 1000.  He probably rakes in 1-2k on a normal night and even 10k on a good weekend.

Now, for the last two weeks, his business has dipped ~70%.  This may be a short term thing and a week or month from now, his customers will come back.  But his customers are not then going to eat multiple plates of *panipuri* to make up for the previous few weeks.

374,"Arey, you don't get my point. Perhaps I wasn't being very articulate. Let us try again.

My point is that on most issues you don't refrain from taking a dig at Modi and seem to oppose him as if it is some sort of obligation.

Arey bhai, if *she* doesn't want closure or to void the marriage, who are you to interfere in their personal matter? Dadi ke umar ki hai woh hamare. Do you think she has progressive ideas about divorce etc?

Earlier this week, in Bihar’s Chhapra district, as part of the recent demonetisation drive, income tax officials conducted raids on several doctors. One of them was Dr RB Sinha (65). The officials reportedly found unaccounted cash worth Rs 6 crore. The stress of losing all his hard earned cash caused him to suffer a cardiac arrest. He died. Tragic.

Except, it isn’t. Dr Sinha did not die. And I-T officials didn’t break down his door. None of this happened. Not a single word is true. But it was reported in local papers.

Fake news is by no means a new phenomenon, or a recent invention. But thanks to the rise of social media platforms, it is giving real news a run for its credibility. It has turned out to be scarily climactic in the demonetisation drive last week, during the US Presidential election before that, and during the Brexit referendum a few months earlier. The top 20 fake news stories outperformed real news at the end of the 2016 Presidential campaign.

To the heady mix of human psychology, partisan interests, and even malicious intent, if you add a bit of tech (read algorithms), you get a lethal weapon to sway public opinion. Since last week, several news stories have made their way into mainstream media, brazenly fake and loosely based on viral WhatsApp forwards. A Surat businessman, who allegedly surrendered Rs 6,000 crore. The news went viral on social platforms, only to be debunked later. Then, there’s the case of the fake Rs 2,000 note, found in Chikmangaluru in Karnataka, which made its way to Twitter thanks to a television journalist, only to be outed as a color photocopy of the original.

Before anyone could sniff it was misinformation, the fake news took a life of its own.

“What makes it difficult to control is that social media eliminates the barrier to entry, while at the same time eliminates quality control, so that untreated sewage ends up competing with purified water,” says a New Delhi-based journalist, a foreign national employed at a large international news organisation. “From there on, as it appears, it becomes about who shouts the loudest, trolls most aggressively and has the amplifier of a big media pipe.”

And, of course, the value migrates to the aggregators and away from the news outlets, who then join the race to the bottom because they can’t afford to back good reporting.

Anant Goenka, executive director of the Indian Express Group says, it is largely a platform issue. “I know Google is working on a trust project. Two years back, I spent some time with Richard Gingras, who is the head of Google News. I have learnt since then that some progress has been made. As long as we can do some kind of a verified sign on news sources, we’re back in the credibility business, rather than the commodity content business.”

Circulation of fake news, in the event of a big news cycle like the demonetisation campaign, Goenka adds, is inevitable. “There’s a lot of confusion, and rumours do come up every now and then, and inevitably make their way to news websites, but I still think that it’s largely a platform issue.”

Earlier this week, Google and Facebook, world’s two biggest such platforms facing criticism over how fake news on their distribution channels may have influenced the US elections, banned fake news websites from accessing their advertising networks.

Closer home, we have the WhatsApp forward menace where, as we understand, specific groups plant deliberate misinformation that masquerades as fact. And in some instances, like Sinha’s case, it reaches the mainstream. And how big is that number? A Pew Research Center survey in May revealed that a whopping 62% of Americans get their news via social media. While the number in India may not be that high yet, it is increasing by the day, given the ever-growing smartphone penetration which is now estimated to be between 250 to 300 million.

The threat of fake news is real.




The contagion

In India, those who fuel it are in consensus on the modus operandi: WhatsApp’s broadcast message service and its groups feature are increasingly used by political parties for propaganda purposes. They say WhatsApp is preferred because of its mass appeal.

“If there is one platform to reach the masses, it is WhatsApp,” says a New Delhi-based social media manager with a political party. The messenger app owned by Facebook, WhatsApp today has at least 160 million monthly active users in India, its highest global user base. “All parties use propaganda to reach out to their volunteers, who in turn distribute it through their groups. The power of WhatsApp is such that we can ensure a reach of at least 100,000 people within 10 minutes of the information being sent out.”

Propaganda aside, messages often range from a rumour to a data point, or even a made-up piece of information, often to confuse people. “For a successful message, we believe it must have three elements – distribution, content, and psychology. If one of these three elements don’t turn up well enough, the messaging is a failed attempt. Trust is key. You have to realise that a majority of our people are gullible enough to believe anything we tell them. That helps us use sentiments like emotion, pride, hurt in our messaging rather well,” the person quoted above added.

And importantly, as someone propagating the message, you have to believe in it, rather than believe it. “If we take the Rs 2,000 note as an example, the reason why it was forwarded multiple times was because people believed in it while having doubts. It also appealed to several possibilities – like the use of technology, because Narendra Modi is a tech-savvy prime minister.”

While political parties and their social media cells are one potential source of fake news, it need not be the case every single time. “Why just us? We often reach out to our volunteers and sympathisers. It could be anyone [from the larger population] making a witty or a provocative comment and it could still end up as fake information,” he added.

The Ken reached out to three WhatsApp and Facebook officials. One of them, who did not want to be identified, said, “There is no clear view on WhatsApp, besides what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said in his post-election Facebook update.“

377,"Ok finally got it.   

Have you considered that I may believe what I write? I may not be as truthful as you (well nobody can be), but I would like to think I believe around 80% of the stuff I write though I may exaggerate for effect. 

I have supported Modi whenever he did something I actually agree with. Or at the very least, I didn't write against it.   

- There was a rumour that BJP is going to tax long term capital gains in the stock market - I agreed with that &amp; defended it though it would hit me. I never sell stock before 1 year (to take advantage of the no tax on long term capital gains policy).  

- There are some things the AYUSH ministry did which I agree with - for eg, they allowed AYUSH doctors, mid wives to provide some very basic medical care in case they do some training or some such criteria. I was probably the only one here who defended that. I think they are good enough to treat cough, cold, provide first aid and basic stuff &amp; we badly need more people who can do that in places where there is no one.
- Jallikattu    
- They increased IIT fees, I was one of the very few here who didn't criticise it. And even the way they implemented it was well thought out.   
- I am the only one who defends BJP's stand of not wanting political parties under RTI   
- And of course this issue - useless RTIs - Modi's mark sheets and stuff like that.   

There may be more stuff - but this is what I can think of now.   

  

Even today, I said that Modiji's idea is a good idea in theory at atleast - https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5do2bl/pm_narendra_modi_calls_for_state_funding_of_polls/da61wqa/ though practically it's not good in India.",2016-11-19 07:13:42
378,"&gt; 1) Panipuriwala earns 40k to 50k going by your numbers.

Is that too much or too little for your taste?  Whatever it is, the guy works hard for it.  He starts his day by dragging his rickety *gaadi* over bad roads from the shed (for which he pays rent in cash to the owner)... then his brother and nephew help him.  His mother helps out some times.  And yes, at the end of the day he does rake in some serious cash on good weekends.  But he's earning every last penny of that.

&gt;2) I bet he pays no income tax although legally he should be paying 10% thanks to cash only transactions.

Of course he pays no income tax.  You know why?  Because the govt., school he went to barely gave him enough of an education to make panipuris and count change.  That is all that he knows and he does a damn fine job of it.  Then he works so hard and long that he doesn't know the first thing about income taxes, let alone prepare his returns and file it.  

In the event that he wants to make himself aware of such things, all of that literature and websites are in either English or Hindi.  In Modi's India, even the full page ads and hoardings in deep interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are in Hindi.  Educating the masses is the government's job.  And that cannot be done when Laude Ke Baal Modi is more interested in shoving Hindi ads in Kannada newspapers than driving home the message.  The 'masses' cannot be expected to go out of their way and learn about stuff.

And on top of this, he regularly gets extorted by the local mamool mafias and hijras.  The guy needs no lessons in patriotism from anybody and all that he has ever done is earn an honest living.  He had nothing whatsoever to do with the hordes of black money that Modi and his ilk run their election campaigns on.

And in any case, even if he had filed his 10% taxes, the question still remains -  who among Modi and his *baap* will reimburse him for last week's losses and next week's/month's losses?  Or do *you* want to volunteer and take one for the Supreme Leader?",2016-11-19 07:40:40

___

The cash crunch in the country, created through the demonetisation of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes by the Union government, has taken its toll on wheat-sowing activities in Punjab and Haryana.

With the cash flow slowing down to a trickle, wheat farmers in the two states are finding it hard to initiate the agricultural process. They do not have money required to meet input costs such as seeds, fertilisers and diesel. According to experts, even a single day’s delay can affect the harvest.

Data accessed by HT shows that 75% of wheat has been sown in Punjab’s fields till now – translating to around 26 lakh hectares of the state’s 35 lakh-hectare coverage area.

“Sowing work should ideally be finished by November 15, and any delay means suffering a loss of 1.5 quintals per acre every week (18-20 quintal per acre is the average production),” said agriculture director JS Bains.

In Haryana, wheat is sown across two belts in a staggered manner. At present, sowing has been completed in around 70% of the 19 lakh hectares across the state’s southern and northern parts. However, there are another 5.5 lakh hectares of land in the cotton belt, where sowing of wheat goes on till mid-December. Many farmers who had primed their fields for this activity lack money to purchase seeds, pesticides and fertilisers.

Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) faction in Punjab, bemoaned how scarcity of money was preventing farmers from sowing wheat on time. “Some farmers managed to get seeds and fertilisers on credit, but not everybody can afford to do that,” he said, adding that the government must take steps to prevent the situation from getting out of hand.

Anil Kumar, a farmer who owns 10 acres of land in Fatehabad, said agriculturists in Haryana have been facing too many problems in the recent past. “First the hailstorm, then the whitefly attack, and now, demonetisation. We are under a lot of stress,” he said.

Avtar Singh, a farmer from Binjon in Punjab, said that while he appreciated the Modi government’s efforts to combat black money, it should have taken the farmers’ plight into consideration before taking the plunge. “I can afford to buy seeds and fertilisers on credit to sow wheat. However, many small farmers don’t have that luxury. Even I am facing difficulty buying pipes for irrigation because I don’t have any cash,” he added.

However, Haryana additional director (agriculture) Suresh Gahlawat claimed the slowdown in sowing will not have a major impact on the wheat yield. “A lot depends on the weather in the coming months,” he said.

Mumbai/New Delhi/Bengaluru: On 7 November, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped high-value banknotes, the regulated wholesale fruit market at Vashi in Navi Mumbai checked in around 250 trucks, each carrying 10 tonnes of farm produce. Around the same number of trucks arrived the next day at the market run by the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). But the number dropped to 170 trucks the next day

“There has been a drop of nearly 30% in the inflow of fruits since 8 November. Consequently, there has been a proportionate reduction in the revenue that the APMC receives,” said S. C. Kawarke, APMC deputy secretary for the terminal market .

The demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes has disrupted business at some of the largest APMC markets in states where the regulated markets are still major landing ports for farm produce. Likewise, the turmoil it unleashed has squeezed farmers in several states and even delayed the transfer of dues to rice growers in Kerala as banks cited a cash crunch.

At Delhi’s Azadpur, Asia’s largest wholesale market dealing in fruits and vegetable, the acute cash crunch has more than halved daily business volumes. “Arrivals have reduced by more than half as we are not able to pay farmers,” said Methi Ram Kriplani, president of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders’ Association. “During this time of the year about 350 trucks of apple arrive but now between 150 to 200 trucks are coming,” he said, adding, “Despite lower supplies prices have fallen as people have reduced their consumption of apples.”

Navi Mumbai’s Vashi APMC, India’s top regulated wholesale market for farm produce in terms of annual revenue, has five vertical terminal markets—vegetables, onions and potatoes, fruits, grains, and spices and dried fruits. APMC officials and wholesalers said arrivals at all five markets had declined by 20-40% since 9 November.

Elsewhere in Maharashtra, the cash crunch has hit APMC markets even harder. In Nashik district, transactions at all four APMC markets, including India’s biggest regulated wholesale market for onions at Lasalgaon, came to a halt on 9 November. After assurances from credit societies and the government, APMCs in Nashik are resuming business from Friday, and contracts will be realized through online transfer of payments to farmers.

The Azadpur market clocks around Rs20 crore of trade every day and a 50% loss in business means traders, farmers and vendors have taken a big hit. It is the same story at Bengaluru’s Yeshwantpur APMC. This market, which typically sees average transactions of around Rs70-80 crore per day (across all commodities, from vegetables to pulses), has seen it fall to an average of Rs7-8 crore per day. “Where is the currency or money for us to sell or buy? We can’t draw money or pay. Transactions have come down almost 90% in the last few days,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bengaluru Wholesale Foodgrain and Pulses Merchants Association. “In a few days, we are expecting stocks of togare (tool dal, or pigeon pea) of around 5,000-10,000kg. Now who has the money to buy from the farmer and then sell to us and then to the trader?”

In Kerala’s paddy-rich Palakkad district, P.V. Rajappan is one among the many farmers who have not got a single rupee transferred to their accounts, although it has been a month since he delivered his paddy yield of 10,250kg to the state-run Civil Supplies Corporation, popularly known as Supplyco. Rajappan says the payment of Rs2.25 lakh was supposed to come to his account last week, but Supplyco officials have told him and others not to expect payment soon. This comes at a time when a deficient north-east monsoon has left all southern states dry.

That's assuming it's only him and no other labor. which hardly is the case. There'll be his wife or some other relative or another worker at least. I hardly believe his Rs 10 per plate ""profit"" is after all costs *and* wages. 

Even without all that, just using Section VI exemptions, HRA and some mutual fund investments, it's quite easy to be under 2.5l limit for a 5l per annum salary. And here's the punch - every single middle-class person can (and does) take those perfectly legal deductions to reduce his tax payment, but those avenues are clearly unavailable to him. Mr Modi is not going to make CAs work 7 days to help teach those tax-illiterate people.

Like in the Triple Talaq case, you thought that the best thing to write about the topic was that Modi was doing it for political purposes. I mean, ffs, Modi is a politician. Politicians, by training, automatically think about the political effects of everything they do. Is it really important to point that out, especially when the cause being raised is almost unambivalently good? And do we really need to attack him about his personal life? Do you actually believe that his personal life is really worth attacking? He was forced into a marriage as a child, but felt a higher calling and decide to run away from home. The wife, 13, grows up with his family, earns an education and becomes a school teacher and that is her life now. Has *she* ever expressed the desire to be separated from Modi? If not, then the status quo is the most desirable outcome given the incompatible desires of all parties involved. What do you find worth attacking about this?

Those chiller hoarders are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of our huge economy. Moreover most are finding several loopholes to get them converted to white you are not going to retain most of their black money anyway. I seriously doubt if the cost of this whole exercise was worth it with the impact on the economy. Had Modi government been able to bring Black money from foreign accounts AND then done this, the govenment would not only have had credibility for doing it but also would have had a safety net for the cost of executing this exercise. Marginalized people would still have suffered and the efficacy of that particular exercise would still be suspect due to so many existing loopholes but the Modi government could have very easily come out unscathed

&gt;Now coming back to the suffering, the technically inclined doesn't even have a problem in the first place. For example, I order my groceries from bigbasket.com, get my stuff from amazon, book tickets using makemytrip and redbus.in, what for do I need cash for? For the little things like house expenses, the 2000 that can be withdrawn from ATMs every now and then is more than sufficient! If most people start working in this way, what for do we need cash at all?

&gt; * From keeping Indian defense jets on the ready to transfer cash from mints, to banks knocking on the doors of religious institutions to access smaller change, Indian ingenuity is being stretched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's cash ban to crackdown on unaccounted money.India's cash economy has been thrown into turmoil since Modi announced last week that 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would cease to be legal tender and would have to be deposited at banks by year-end, leaving about one-seventh of currency in circulation.

&gt; * Since the crackdown, new currency bills have had to be airlifted by helicopter from Patna after reports of shortage in Bokaro and Jamshedpur, a finance ministry official said.There was a surge in demand for luxury watches after Modi's sudden announcement as wealthy Indians rushed to make costly purchases with unaccounted cash.

&gt; * ""It will take a few more days for the situation to normalize,"" Gupta said in an e-mailed statement.Compounding the problem of pumping new money into the system is the need to reconfigure the country's 220,000 cash machines so that they can dispense the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes, which do not fit into existing ATM cash trays, according to Navroze Dastur, the managing director for India and South Asia at NCR Corp., which supplies about two-thirds of the country's machines.

The Congress Party on Monday alleged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA Government of disrespecting the memory and sacrifice of former prime minister Indira Gandhi. Congress leader Anand Sharma said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a member of the grand old party and the BJP and RSS should remember his action of banning the organization.

“Indira Gandhi’s martyrdom is respected by the people of this country. It is matter of shame that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government are disrespecting the memory and ultimate sacrifice of India’s late prime minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi,” he said. “I would like to remind the BJP and the RSS that they should also remember Sardar Patel’s action and the decision to ban the RSS. They should also publish this in their government advertisements,” Sharma said.

Earlier in the day, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi along with senior leaders such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, led a march from party headquarters at 24, Akbar Road to Indira Gandhi memorial museum at 1, Safdarjung Road on the death anniversary of the former prime minister. Due to a surge in bird flu instances in the national capital, the Delhi government had to close down the memorial of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a Shakti Sthal. With October 31 being her death anniversary, the party has altered its plans for the day. The top rung instead of paying homage to the deceased leader, will now organise a march from the party headquarters to Indira Gandhi memorial museum.

Remembering the contribution of the ‘Iron man’ of India, Prime Minister Modi on Sunday urged the nation to promote unity and equality among all. “Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel worked to bring everyone together, he worked for unity, fought for unity and brought unity among the people. We also have to forget about all our customs and traditions and treat a girl and a boy equally, and we are moving fast,” said Prime Minster Modi while addressing the nation in the 25th edition of his popular ‘ Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme.

“We should take a positive step towards it and work to promote equality in the society. But on one Sardar’s birthday, history remembers how the Sikhs and ‘sardars’ all over the country faced violence and pain, which is why we all need to learn that we all must unite and work towards unity rather than allowing divisiveness to spread,” he added. Indira Gandhi was the first and to date the only female prime minister of India. She was assassinated after she ordered the storming of the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar to counter the Punjab insurgency.

On October 31, 1984, two of her Sikh bodyguards shot her with their service weapons at the Prime Minister’s residence. Both the accused were sentenced to death and hanged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail, while following her cremation, millions of Sikhs were displaced and nearly three thousand were killed in anti-Sikh riots.

Today, an estimated average of 68,922 Indian citizens will turn 25. Tomorrow there will another 68,922 newly minted 25 year olds. Ditto the day after tomorrow and the day after that, and so on till 2025.

That number— 68,922 — is an average calculated on a projection of age-wise population data that was sourced from the national census of 2011 and what it means is this: Every month, 2.1 million people in India will turn 25. Of them, 1.48 million will be in rural India and remaining 0.62 million in urban centres. What it also means is that 10 years from now, in 2025, there will be 690 million Indian citizens below the age of 25.

By then, India’s population is expected to grow to 1.43 billion and under-25s will comprise more than 48%.

Why am I throwing these numbers at you on a Sunday morning? You, I and everyone else already know(s) that even today India is one of the world’s biggest “young” nations with nearly two-thirds of its population below the age of 35 and nearly half below 25.

So what’s the big deal about 2025 when there will be nearly 700 million under-25s?

Quite a bit, really, if you consider how India’s population numbers rarely make their way into political discourse nowadays, at least not in any serious manner.



Read | Census sees jump in tech graduates, but jobs scarce

No Indian political party, whichever part of the spectrum you choose to look at, talks about the country’s population surge and the immense challenges that it poses.

Yet references to India’s “demographic dividend” are plenty, with everyone from marketers, economists and politicians referring to that big bulge of young people as the real edge that India could have over other countries across the world — many of which (with the exception of some in Africa) have populations that are aging.

India’s present population of 1.25 billion (or “125 crore” as Prime Minister Narendra Modi likes to phrase it in his Hindi speeches; he made 28 references to it in his Independence Day speech this year) and the estimate that it will outstrip China’s by 2022, and not 2028 as was earlier expected, often become a cue for chest-thumping pride, which, if you really think of it, may be misplaced.

Having a big bulge of people in the age group of 18-55 (or the working age group) can most certainly be a potential advantage — potential because many things have to fall into place before it becomes real. More than seven out of 10 of India’s young people live in rural India, primarily eking their livelihood off unproductive farms with little skill or education to be of use in anything other than manual labour.



Read | 127,42,39,769 and on the increase: India's huge population

Those in urban areas are only slightly better off with their overall quality of education making them inadequate for meaningful employment.

Successive Indian governments, the present incumbent included, have tried to focus on addressing the skill deficit in India’s working age population but with limited success.

The thing is that government schemes to make people job-ready such as Modi’s Skill India are slow burn programmes that take much longer than it takes for the population bulge to grow bigger.

You could accuse me of invoking the ghost of Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, the 18th century English cleric, who predicted a catastrophe if unchecked population growth (which he said grows geometrically) outstripped the supply of food (which grows arithmetically) but consider the facts.

India’s population growth has actually slowed down (it was 3% in the 1980s; 1.8% in the 1990s; and is now only 1.2%) but on a base as large as India’s, even 1.2% leads to absolute numbers that are staggering.

Malthus predicted that runaway growth of the world’s population without the resources to feed and sustain it would ultimately lead to a catastrophe as a spate of famines, diseases, epidemics and wars would take place.

Now consider this. If India’s population of young people grows to huge numbers — as it will — but meets up with large-scale joblessness and millions of dashed hopes, and that in turn leads to widespread civil unrest, crime and violence, would you call it a catastrophe?

420,"Anecdotal evidence here:

There are 2 SBI branches where I live. (Mumbai, Eastern Suburbs). One is the main branch and another is a small one.

After finishing my chores in the morning by 11am I hit the small branch today to withdraw using cheque. There were about 30 people in the branch (today being SBI customers only + senior citizens day) Went to the manager's office to ask where I should stand to encash my self cheque. Manager asked me to sit down, called an admin person who took my cheque, and came back with my cash. Then the admin person brought me a glass of water. While talking to the manager I was told that their ATM operations were outsourced (many banks and their branches have outsourced their ATM operations). The branch staff was only responsible for keeping the ATM kiosk clean and to ensure the police visited it regularly. Filling cash, ensuring network connectivity, power etc was the onus of the company to which they had outsourced the operation. This company and many like them were inefficient even during the best of times but now they are truly screwed. But since it is an SBI ATM, the employees and the manager face people's flak. The SBI manager clearly told me they were not equipped to handle the footfall they are seeing since Nov 9 (9/11!, Modi ka chaal hai, bc).

edit: *I wonder if these outsourced ATM companies are a leak in the system re: old vs new money*

I then went to main branch because they have a CDM there. There was a queue (4 people ahead of me). It took about 20 minutes but deposited my money. 

edit: *The queue to withdraw money from the ATM was ~50 people long*

This kind of service was unthinkable on Nov 9 (9/11!, Modi ka chaal hai, bc) and imo, things will only get better. 

My predicition is that it'll get better for the next 2 weeks and that the situation will deteriorate after the first week of December, when hoarders will realize there will be no rollback, the avenues for accepting old currencies would have dried up,  and they would descend en masse to deposit their money (lots of it, stressing the bank staff) or will try to disrupt the working of the country by other nefarious means.",2016-11-19 13:06:09

Instead of jaitley actually apologizing humbly and accept that implementation has been a VERY big disaster, he is being smug and not even ready to listen to anyone. Just look at him smirking while sitting in the parliament. The guy is too drunk on power. How the fuck do you justify deaths? The supreme court has said that you can have riots on the street, the situation is that serious. Don't be so blind as to not question. 

Do you think Modi has never done anything illegal? Why do you think the political parties are not disclosing their funding? BJP is also in that. 

When many economists themselves say that there were less costly and more effective strategies to implement before this, why didn't he do that? 

What I feel about all those scams? I feel enraged. But how I feel about this whole change of currency fiasco? Given the magnitude of fake currency (only 400 Crore), no revolutionary new security features (only a matter of time before we have fake notes again), the horrible logistics ~~planning~~ ill-planning. Modi not even coming to the parliament to answer questions. All these things make me doubt him. 

It doesn't make me anti-national or a congress mole or a black money hoarder. Grow up and learn to analyze things taking in to account everything. I'm all for this change of currency, but Modi needs to lay public what the plan was, who was involved, what the numbers were, what was expected, what did not go as per the plan, who all were consulted, what is current status of the note printing. 

There are a 1000 questions. Has the government followed the law? There are various people right now pointing out that though the government is right in declaring 500/1000 illegal, it can not put a limit on how much people can withdraw from their bank account without passing a law. All these things need to investigated else this sets a very dangerous precedent. So much power in the hands of one man is not good. 

The move is undeniably good. The first two days, even I was proud and happy. But then the initial euphoria started to settle down and facts along with the opinions of eminent economists and personalities started to pour in. Listen to them. Analyze them. However, I was still with Modi but the way this has been implemented and the arrogance of Jaitley and Modi not even coming to the parliament to answer, makes me question the government and I have every right to do so.

NEW DELHI: At a time when the Centre's decision to ban currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is meant to curb black money, B RAmbedkar's grandson and Dalit activistPrakash Ambedkar, who also runs his political outfitBharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, has a question for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: How will RSS account for the money that it collects from donations?



Ambedkar's contention is that when people have been instructed by the government to deposit the banned notes with banks, how will the Sangh, which is not registered as a company, an NGO or trust or a political party get its wealth converted into white money.



On every Vijaya Dashmi day the RSS holds a huge rally in Nagpur where people make donations almost like a ""charawa"" (gift) at religious altars mostly in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, said Ambedkar, while speaking to TOI.



He added that these donations amount to crores and it is hardly a secret as the RSS chief announces it during his annual day speech at the Sangh headquarters.



""Can the Prime Minister explain how this money is being converted and where has this money gone?"" asked Ambedkar at a time when the Dalit movement across the country is gaining momentum and a major Dalit-Adivasi-minority rally has been planned at the Ramlila grounds here on November 27.



RSS is not registered as a political party with theElection Commission, it is not registered as a company under the Companies Act, or as a charitable trust under any state trust act, so how will it justify the amount in banks, Ambedkar asked.



He also reminded the government that during Prime Minister V P Singh's tenureVishwa Hindu Parishadhad received a donation of Rs 700 crore from donors abroad, mainly in the US.



""This was being investigated by an income tax officer MrGuptaand BJP and RSS made a lot of hue and cry about it at that time and the officer was transferred out.""



Soon after, when the V P Singh government fell and the case was subsequently shut, nobody knew where the money went,"" Ambedkar said, hoping that the huge amount collected by the Sangh does not disappear in the same manner.

“We were worried there would be no one in the audience,” said Anil Dharker, director of Tata Literature Live!, as he addressed a full house at the lit fest’s inaugural session on Thursday.

There was hardly a free seat available, in fact, as lovers of literature and debate gathered at the NCPA’s Tata Theatre to hear author Amitav Ghosh and author-and-politician Shashi Tharoor discuss the legacy of the Raj at the release of Tharoor’s new book, An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India.

Two shadows loomed large, though they weren’t on stage — those of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his predecessor, Manmohan Singh. References to their diplomatic speeches and how they addressed the issue of India’s history with imperialism flew back and forth between the speakers, creating a merry political undercurrent through the session.

Did Singh really need to apologise, at one Oxford speech, for the end of British rule? Did Modi, in a more recent speech, unfairly sidestep Raj atrocities when he said he wanted to focus on the future?

In his book, Tharoor — also a former diplomat — argues that British Empire, today viewed in the UK as a kind of benign altruism or essential tool for modernity, was in reality a horrific, selfish assault on India.

Apologists for imperialism argue that the British gave India a legal system. “But what the British put in place was not a rule of law but a two-tier system of rules that applied differently to Indians and themselves, a system that prevails today, where some are still above the law,” Ghosh pointed out. “Only four cases exist of Englishmen convicted of murdering Indians and receiving serious punishment,” Tharoor added.

Tharoor also described as a “big colonial scam” the idea that the British gifted India a railway system. “[It was] established to more effectively move goods and minerals out of India to Britain. Indians, squeezed into third class, still paid the highest third-class train fares in the world at the time. Indian freight rates, in comparison, were some of the lowest,” he said.

He ended with a reminder that much of this comes as a surprise to today’s UK citizens, who’ve been raised on a very different version of their history.

For Richa Gulati, a media student who skipped class for the session, Tharoor’s talk put her in mind of Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year. “Post-truth, which means we’ve stopped heeding fact and started making up our own truths, is exactly what this is,” she said. “Migrant violence in the UK comes from the same ignorance and misbelief. This is a legacy that should be reexamined.”

Anjali Pratap, a businesswoman who was also in the audience, pointed out that many questions posed by Ghosh about political repercussions of the Raj remained unanswered, “very diplomatically, as expected”.

The Literature Live! festival sessions run until Sunday, at the NCPA in Nariman Point and at Prithvi Theatre in Juhu.

Before this, he insinuated that Modi accepted bribes from PayTM for pursuing demonestisation. This is just in the last few days.

  There is an element of spasmodic jerkiness about some of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies.  

 

  In foreign affairs, this unevenness was seen in his interactions with Pakistan, which swung from warm friendliness to hostility, raising fears of a war.  

 

  In domestic matters, the sudden outlawing of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has caused a turmoil in all sectors of the economy, resulting in severe inconvenience to individuals and throwing trade and agricultural activity out of gear.  

 

  Understandably, no advance notice could be given about the demonetisation of high-denomination currency in case the hoarders of black money took advantage of the disclosure. But the transition from one type of legal tender to another could have been managed in a far more smooth manner.  

 

  Since no forethought was apparently given to the impact on the ordinary people of the withdrawal of the notes, which constitute an estimated 86 per cent of those in circulation, banks and ATMs have had to face an unprecedented rush -- with some people even dying while standing for long hours in queues.  

 

  Because of the prevailing misery outside banks and ATMs, the initial reaction of the people has changed from welcoming the move because of its intention of curbing black money to deep unease and even anger about the government's deplorable failure of implementation.  

 

  It was only when the disorderly scenes inside and outside the banks threatened to jeopardise the government's initiative that belated efforts were made to ensure separate queues for the elderly. But it is clear that it will take weeks for order to be restored.  

 

  If the Prime Minister thought that his latest move was yet another surgical strike -- Congress leader Kapil Sibal has called it carpet bombing -- which will boost the government's image, he must have realised that it is not being seen in the same positive light as the earlier one.  

 

  Unless the banks can begin to function with a modicum of efficiency, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will have to pay an electoral price.  

 

  The first test will be in Uttar Pradesh when the assembly elections are held early next year. It is a poll which the BJP cannot afford to lose since its victory in Assam in the far corner of the country has not been enough to erase the stain of its defeats in Delhi and Bihar.  

 

  The party's fears will be all the greater since it is now admitted that the economic situation will get worse before it can improve.  

 

  It is the period when the GDP is expected to fall by nearly one percentage point, which will be of considerable worry to the BJP because the opposition parties will not lose this opportunity to pillory the government.  

 

  From this standpoint, the otherwise bold and much-needed demonetisation has come as a godsend to opposition parties like the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Aam Admi Party and others, which care more about scoring brownie points than about taking a holistic view.  

 

  Some of the BJP's allies like the Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena have also joined the dissenters, probably to emphasise their distinctiveness vis-a-vis Big Brother rather than to seriously oppose the move since they have prefaced their criticism by hailing the move.  

 

  The Bahujan Samaj Party's joining of the nay-sayers is clearly intended to reap electoral benefits in the forthcoming contest in Uttar Pradesh, where it has a more than average chance of success.  

 

  The BJP will be grateful, therefore, that at least some parties have seen the bigger picture and decided to support demonetisation despite the severe inconvenience faced by the ordinary people.  

 

  These include the Janata Dal-United, the Biju Janata Dal, the Nationalist Congress Party, the DMK, the Telugu Desam and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi.  

 

  To retrieve the situation, the government has to act more resolutely to alleviate the distress of the ordinary people by revving up the creaking banking sector.  

 

  It is possible that Modi's initiative has been motivated by the realisation that two-and-a-half years into his reign, the government's achievements have been less than substantial.  

 

  The economy remains sluggish and employment prospects are not too bright in an age of automation.  

 

  His promise, therefore, of boosting job-creation via rapid economic growth hasn't quite been fulfilled, although he still remains the best bet among all the politicians if only because there is no one else who fits the bill.  

 

  While Rahul Gandhi is yet to make up his mind about becoming the Congress president, probably because of an innate realisation that he may make a mess of his ascent, other claimants have generally shot themselves in the foot like Bihar Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has sacrificed his USP of restoring law and order and boosting growth at the altar of prohibition.  

 

  For Modi, the gamble of demonetisation is some kind of a make-or-break venture. Even if it poses electoral risks in the short term, it is bound to yield dividends at the time of the next general election in 2019 when the economy will have overcome the present hump of a logistical nightmare afflicting the banks.  

 

  As a result, the GDP will begin to rise as lakhs and crores of the new legal tender enter the banking system. But, for the present, the teething troubles will continue.

  NEW DELHI: Congress today accused the government of ""branding"" people through its ""fascist act"" of inking those exchanging demonetised currency notes even as it charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with ""disrespecting"" Parliament by not hearing out concerns raised by members on demonetisation.  

 

  Party spokesperson Anand Sharma said the Modi government was ""insulting and harassing"" crores of Indians by subjecting them to stand in long queues to withdraw money and demanded apology from the Prime Minister and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.  

 

  ""The decision to put indelible ink on fingers of account holders is a senseless, Fascist and Nazist act of branding people. It is shameful that they have done so with foreign tourists. Instead of sermonising, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Finance minister should hang their heads in shame and apologise to the people,"" he told PTI.  

 

  He said the Prime Minister saying that he will not answer the concerns raised by opposition members in Parliament shows how he is ""disrespecting"" Parliament.  

 

  ""The PM's stand in not being present in Parliament smacks of arrogance and disrespect for the institution of Parliament. Narendra Modi does not have the courage to face the truth and lacks the grace to apologise to the people for the suffering inflicted on crores of Indians,"" he said.  

 

  The Congress leader said India's image globally has been besmirched with foreign missions issuing advisories to their citizens against travelling to India.  

 

  Sharma also accused the Prime Minister of indulging in ""selective leaks"" from September onwards and said ""it is government's failure to maintain secrecy and selectively leak the proposed step to individuals and vested interests and groups identified with BJP.""  

 

  ""It is a big scam which demands an investigation. The opposition demand of JPC is fully justified and we are determined to press for it,"" he said.  

 

  Sharma took strong objection to Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu's remarks targeting Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad. Azad had equated the Uri terror attack and deaths in queues at banks in terms of deaths. Sharma said Naidu's statement ""mischievously distorts the comments made by the Leader of Opposition"".  

 

  He said, ""In their desperation, Naidu and the government are seeking to communalise the comments also by raising the bogie of nationalism, which definitely is not their exclusive domain.""  

 

  The former Union Minister said, ""Instead of urgently addressing the situation caused by demonetisation move, the government is engaging in false propaganda and escape accountability.""

&gt; * Legally, the income tax department and the CBI, who have not conducted any investigations on the documents that were seized at the raids at the offices of the Sahara India Group and the AV Birla group of companies yet, have gone against the Supreme Court instructive.

&gt; * The Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Chouhan allegedly received Rs 10 crore between 29 September 2013 and 1 October 2013 in two instalments from one Neeraj Vashisht, while his counterpart in Chhattisgarh, Raman Singh, apparently received Rs 4 crore as a single one-off payment on 1 October from Nand ji.

To be honest I really don't care about that vegetable vendor, as I'm comfortable where I am, but at least I understand and empathize with him when he tells me his problem. I guess you lack that basic empathy.

&gt;* Demonetisation has not affected flow of cash, gold and silver offerings at the hundi of the famous hill shrine of Lord Venkateswara, at Tirumala here, according to a senior temple official.

&gt;* three crore daily in cash, besides offerings in gold and silver, from thousands of devotees across the country, who are undeterred by demonetisation, temple Public Relations Officer Dr. Talari Ravi said.

&gt;* On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes with effect from midnight, making these notes invalid in a major assault on black money, fake currency and corruption.

&gt;* In his televised address to the nation, Modi had said people holding these notes can deposit them in their banks and post office accounts from November 10 till December 30.

&gt;* Ravi said that in 2012 on the auspicious Sri Rama Navami day, the hundi had received the biggest single days cash offerings of Rs 5.73 crore.

Psychiatrists in Kolkata are finding surge in patients from the rural community, all of a sudden, after the demonetisation by Narendra Modi.



A potato wholesaler from rural Bengal came to a super-specialty hospital in Kolkata to seek help for himself. He was a wholesaler who used to stock potatoes and then pass that to small traders. The whole chain of transactions took place in cash. He would generally stock the potatoes worth Rs 40-50 lakhs.



“Now with demonetisation, suddenly there is no cash transactions. The small traders who used to pay the man in cash with Rs 500 and Rs 1000 could not buy the vegetables. And thus the anxiety which generates stress,” said Dr. Sanjay Garg, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist, Fortis Anandapur.



The doctor added, “There is a sudden surge of this kind of patients in recent days. Over the past couple of days, I have received quite a few cases from people on whom demonetisation has taken an adverse toll. Many of these calls have come to me from Rural Bengal where people are largely dependent on liquid cash.”



For example, this potato stockiest had taken the stock on credit and now he needs to sell the perishable products quickly. “But with this sudden standstill, there is cash panic. In our clinic, we give medications in severe cases, do counseling and teach them relaxation

techniques also.”



According to psychiatrists, the cash panic is due to anxiety and severe stress.



Another case from rural Bengal was of a farmer, who actually used to deploy labourers in his land and all the payments were done in cash.



“Now with sudden cash crunch, they are failing to pay in notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denominations. Thus everything has come to a standstill. Thus anxiety and cash panic.” Dr Garg said.



Another psychiatrist Dr Anumit Basu said, a doctor from a government hospital, “I have received such cases as well. But many are unable to understand the cause of sudden panic attacks. They are coming with family members and are feeling helpless due to the cash crunch and lack of transactions in the rural market.
