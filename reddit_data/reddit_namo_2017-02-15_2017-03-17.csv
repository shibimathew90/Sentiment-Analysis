2,"Half of rIndia's going to be up in arms next month about demo/NaMo again, because of ""ideological disagreement,"" obviously.",2017-02-20 20:01:37
3,"I find it hilarious that people who complained for years about Congress' sycophancy towards the Gandhi family, lap up the kind of personality cult NaMo and co, churn out.

If you are an objective voter - you have to find all such things sickening. Whether its Modi or Rahul Gandhi or Kejriwal. We are governed by elected representatives not benevolent dictators.",2017-02-21 14:16:18
4,"&gt; Congress' sycophancy towards the Gandhi family, lap up the kind of personality cult NaMo and co, churn out.

The current Gandhi parivar is a political failure. Modi is an achiever. A poor guy who rose and became PM without using family name. His cult exists for a reason.",2017-02-21 17:44:31
5,"Although the results are great I am quite confident this is not because of any modi wave, its because of good work done by fadnavis and his team in maharashtra and thats the way things should operate. Credit to the whole BJP team and NaMo",2017-02-23 18:59:27

7,Wait till NaMo announces forced sterilization and see Randia ~~alleviating~~ elevating him to god level.,2017-02-27 19:18:37
8,"Dude, to be fair. It's weird to have Vajpayee and NaMo photos hanging in your living room. And it does sap you of your credibility when you're calling other people political pawns.",2017-03-01 23:29:14

India is definitely changing.jai NaMo.",2017-03-10 18:14:30
13,I have said for a long time that Demo did not do any harm to Namo. It may even have helped. I don't think it did Modi any harm in any of the elections today. Modi is probably the greatest politician I have seen - once in a liftetime politician. I cannot think of any other politician who could have come out of Demo smelling of roses. It's great credit to Congress that they beat him in 3 states today. ,2017-03-11 17:28:11

16,"They didn't alienate any parties. Even after massive LS victory, NaMo tried to get other parties to join NDA, mainly for support in RS. Of course, if they think they can win on their own there is little to no point on an alliance with any big party. What happened in Bihar definitely took BJP by surprise and later by balls.",2017-03-12 23:57:32
17,NaMo hires the best PR firm in the business. ,2017-03-14 14:14:34
