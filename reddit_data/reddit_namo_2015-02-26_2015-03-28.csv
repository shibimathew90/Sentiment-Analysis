3,"I think it is more keeping 2019 elections in mind. You can't say to the public ""humne 150 raftar ki 160 kar di"". No one will care despite being a good move(taking your word for it). Instead, ""Humne Japan jaisi train shuru kar di"". Crowd goes wild, ""Namo namo namo"". Win-win. 

Healthy mix of populism and reformism from what I have gathered so far. I worry that NDA will build up something like ABV did only for the next ruling party to come and give it all away for freeeeeeeee

He should have resigned, or at least threatened to do so. People would have supported him. Unfortunately, he never realized it.  ",2015-02-28 17:23:01

6,"I know this tweet is sarcastic, but this highlights the changes that are required when any party is growing. AAP is barely 2 years - think when then JP/BJP were 2 years old. They already were derived from other parties, so were much better off. AAP is a brand new, from scratch party. It will go through many such iterations of local leadership, till AK finds the right set of compatible persons that he can work with and those who can take his vision to the national level. Till then, there will be some experimentation. Don't worry - folks AAPs 67/3 victory will ensure that it gets a steady flow of aspiring leaders who want to make a change and AK will decide form that list, what needs to be done - say what is strategy for Punjab and then Rest of India. And that is what is important for AAP and India that he does things and gets to do things the way he wants. 

See, AAP is not unlike Congress, in one most important sense. There is no Congress without the Gandhis (whatever some of the south leaders might want you to think does not matter). Same goes for AAP - There is no AAP without AK - he single handedly won the elections for AAP. Just like NaMo won it for BJP, so did AK for AAP. That is the main thing here - AK's growth is most important of all. If not for anything, to provide a viable alternative to the BJP (and its long-term pro-upper class stance). So, yes if AK wants 7-8 room bungalows - fine. That is a small (image-wise) price to pay, if that keeps AK happy and lets him focus on building AAP at national level.  

Hence also, the current plan of Sisodia managing Delhi as Dy. CM (actually as acting CM), and AK (once he clears off the budget) then focusing on building the party at a national level. That is the only way for AAP to go. And if some people get in that way, then off with them. ",2015-03-02 08:31:53
7,"Can you please explain - how any of these points resulted in 67/3 win for AAP?

Basically, AAP won because of

1. Honest clean looks of Kejriwal
2. Assurances to help Delhi people in their day to day struggle regarding water, electricity and corruption-ridden police.
3. Promise of a clean corruption-free government, which will complete 5 years of term
4. Hope that Kejriwal will be able to take on might on NaMo, and help get more benefits for Delhi

This is what wins elections in India. And these are the promises of clean corruption-free governance is what people want. When, AAP fights elections in other states - what does it matter if Prashant Bhushan - who did some PILs for 2G (how many years old is that scam now) etc is part of AAP or not. 

People want Kejriwal to solve their day to day problems of 24 hours water, electricity, traffic free roads, housing, Internet etc. Not become a PIL-master for the country. If Prashant Bhushan wants to do that, why he need AAP - Political platform. He can do that as individual right?

11,"If you post something really good/different it manages to escape at times because of the great number of upvotes that come in fairly quickly. It is the regular articles which suffer the most from downvotes because a dedicated number of people of a downvote brigade bury them but other users don't feel compelled enough to upvote. 

With NaMo army, they never had the numbers but they had the coordination. So their 5-10 votes early on were enough to kill or bring a story to the front page (where It got visibility and rose further). These number of votes are enough for many submission, but these votes can't do anything when 200 other people are upvoting.

12,"&gt;If you post something really good/different it manages to escape at times because of the great number of upvotes that come in fairly quickly.

Not true in my experience. My long form posts on economics, history etc have been hit with 2, 3 downvotes almost within minutes of my posting. These would take at the least 5-10 mins to read and assimilate, but a min or two after posting...bam dowwnvotes. After this, like you said, it is followed by a flood of upvotes (10-12) that gives it visibility.

So anybody who downvotes belongs to the Namo Army, while all those who upvote are the enlightened brigade? Seriously dude, the AK army does its fair share of downvoting and 
brigading' and that was the point I was trying to make.

Look at this thread itself, anybody who goes against the grain, even if it is done without shitposting or trolling and is done politely has been downvoted into oblivion (-10, -12 votes). Can we please rest this whole, ""Namo Army downboats stuff"" spiel already please? Yes, as a whole the dynamic in India right now is pro BJP / Modi, this is magnified on the internet, so articles, writeups that catch their fancy will get upvoted, and anything against the grain is downvoted. It is not right (the downvotes especially) but there is nothing sinister about it.

A complete eco system exists around Operation Blue Star. Lot of Canadian and US Dollars. Lot of propaganda and what not. Prime example, a notice to NaMo in US by an ~~Sikh~~ organization for 1984 anti Sikh riots. The riots were political and were anti Sikh for sure but you can easily find content on web that makes the riot look like Hindu-Sikh riots. Indian Army has been dragged into this. I will not rule out possibility of the library being destroyed but was it done intentionally, I will doubt. The whole operation was a disgrace.",2015-03-18 10:02:38

35,"As a Middle Class Tax Paying Citizen staying in one of the non-metro big cities, I do NOT get any of the following govt. benefits

1. No Metro/Usable Rail system
2. No Access to Public Healthcare
3. No Access to Good intra city road infrastructure
4. No Access to Govt. Drinking water
5. No Access to Govt. Garbage collection
6. No Access to decent Govt. Schools where I would be comfortable

But, the ONLY thing which I feel that I get some return on my tax, is when I drive over some of the national highways or the Golden Quadrilateral which was ABV's Pet project.
Even only with 4 lanes, I feel it is very usable. 

So, I am all for NaMo's Diamond Quadrilateral. I do NOT care which MNCs will earn from it. I already get my salary working for a MNC.

It is true that Delhi Jal Board has got some serious work to do to improve its infrastructure but it will take time. And also it is impractical to expect Haryana to continously provide water for the ever increasing Delhi population.

But the potential crisis may happen because of Haryana not providing water to Dwarka WTP through Munak canal. Even though BOTH Haryana &amp; Delhi had initially developed this canal for the purpose providing water to Dwarka WTP.

Heck, even NaMo had declared about the new Munak canal to be used for Dwarka at the rally he held in Dwarka.",2015-03-26 00:50:05
