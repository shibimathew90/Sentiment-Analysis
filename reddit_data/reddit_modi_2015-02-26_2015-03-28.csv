4,"First of all, I couldn't find it anywhere in the report where amnesty has said that ""India saw increased communal violence"", or anything else, suggesting exactly what is being said in the opening line of article.

&gt;Human rights group Amnesty International today criticised the Narendra Modi-led government, **saying under the new regime India has witnessed a rise in communal violence** and its Land Acquisition Ordinance has put thousands of Indians at ""risk"" of forcible eviction.
 
So either FirstPost is outright lying, or Amnesty has said it elsewhere, and not in the report. 

My issue is not with them mentioning it, reading the report, it seems they are indicating dissatisfaction with the pace of rehabilitation work. (again, responsibility of state government) Mentioning that in that context is okay, but that doesn't really justify saying that communal violence has increased in current year.

&gt;By the way, ""regime"" has a negative connotation which I presume was unintended.

27,"&gt;This is what EVERYONE gets wrong. The problem is not that railways/airlines do not make profit - they absolutely can with better management. The problem is that better management requires govt. oversight which is a scarce resource and hence best utilized for things which are non amenable to free market supply.

On Airlines, I fully agree with you. Though if managed the way Etihad or QA is managed, these could be revenue spinners for the GoI. The problem is not in finding management to manage and oversee this entity, but in ensuring politicians (like Praful Patel) don't treat it as their own fiefdom.

I completely disagree with you on railways though, India is a very very poor nation. The average Indian makes Rs 5,000 a month and long distance (or medium, or short for that matter) has to be subsidised even at a cost to the exchequer. We cannot take away the mobility of the people which happens to be a fundamental right. Entrusting this crucial sector to the market is a very difficult decision to take.

&gt;I agree that Delhi is an abberation but I think Vajpayee govt. fell largely due to this fact. The fact that my comment got downvoted to oblivion in a forum which is apprently pro-right should be testament enough.

You seem like you know your economics, and you should know that the ABVP regime outperformed the UPA in almost all major indicators from job creation to infrastructure addition. ABVP lost because ""secular"" parties cobbled together a strong alliance. ABVP did not have the Hindu vote coalescing behind it as Modi had in LS 2014 (and in my view, this will only gather pace and strengthen by 2019). 2009 though, it was Advani's game to lose and boy did he lose it.

new train announcements with most going to the state/constituency the rail minister comes from. This one had more simple things that affect

Shedding the populism of the past, the rail budget demonstrated the Modi government’s intent to turn the cash-strapped public transporter into a modern enterprise with a host of facilities such as more high-speed trains, Wi-Fi at 400 stations, CCTVs in trains for women’s safety and easier norms for unreserved tickets.

It also increased investment in the stretched railways to over 8 lakh crore over the next five years after decades of under-investment that has taken its toll on the world’s fourth-largest rail network struggling to cope with slow services and frequent accidents.

Foreign policy has obviously been the best area of progress.

I'm also very happy with the way Modi is communicating with people.

If people are voting on basis of religion then a few states may swing away from BJP but the majority will be forced to vote for BJP. This in itself creates communal tension and also gives more power to RSS/BJP. Absolute power always corrupts and unfortunately, that may not be an issue for small time mla's(from any party) to use this for a communal agenda and political gain. Modi will be asked to reign in people within his sphere of influence but no-one will call out the other side. Ultimately, this is a tough task at this point considering how corrupt people are  over here.

The minorities should stop feeling threatened and contribute in nation building with an open heart. Ignoring the bigots and cynics may be hard, but this is what all of have to go through at least for some time. At some point we should separate the state and religion.",2015-02-26 21:55:11

Why cannot he learn from Kejriwal, to mind his own business. For e.g. just in 12 days Kejriwal has issued subsidy. That is fantastic speed. Maybe instead of such ullu banaoging, Modi should try to focus on finding mistakes in finance budget.

133,"See - Basically, Modi is NOT From delhi-area or NCR powerhouse. Or even from the North hindi speaking belt. So, it is in his favor to try to reduce importance of Delhi as much as possible. Why? Modi would even love to shift capital to some other place. But, since he cannot do that - he is reducing importance of Delhi. 

Of course, you can give more money to state, and such federation will help in the long run. But, at this time - who was asking for it. But, giving it without any requirement from them to come to delhi with their proposals - he is reducing power of Delhi as controlling entity in India. 

He is preparing that when AAP wins or makes great strides in LS 2019, then by then AAP's stronghold Delhi will NOT be much use - since by then he would have weakened Delhi as a decision making entity in the grand scheme of Indian politics. Modi wants to reduce Delhi to just a mere shell, a rubber stamp over true federal powers distributed to the state. Also, his initiative such as Digital India mean that more government functions can be done online, without need for physical presence in Delhi. Who knows slowly his ministers will start working from their respective states instead of working and living in Delhi. 

Delhi citizens - wake up and notice and do something to reduce this exodus of Power out of Delhi. I know fellow Delhi folks are tired of the babu culture - but that Babu culture is important (in moderation) to uphold the importance of Delhi in India. Otherwise, without any babus, with the secretaries, with the HS, FS and various other crucial departments moving online - what will be importance of Delhi. If that happens, what will be importance of Delhi, other than a mere tourist place. Nothing but just a stop-over on the way to Agra. 

So, Delhities embrace the Babu Culture. Don't fret too much over the red sirens. It is a necessary evil to uphold the importance of Delhi as a region in national politics. Without that, what is Delhi? Please take action today otherwise don't be surprised - if in 5-10 years - Delhi State elections become as important as Mumbai Municipal Elections.

So adding value to it so that the scheme can be improved upon and made less-useless is the only option. This is where ""political sense"" comes in.

179,"I am replying to a second post of yours assuming you are not a troll which was my previous assumption. 

Arvind Kejriwal won in Delhi because people were fed up of the same style of politics for decades and wanted to give AK a chance. He did not get voted because of his work in 49 days but because people saw something different in him which they didn't see in any other political party. His humility and honesty also helped him a lot. Fair play to him.  He deserved to win Delhi elections.

Reading your other posts I have gathered that you are anti BJP primarily because they fucked up Karnataka. That is why, as you said, they lost. The bad work of a political party always gets reflected in votes(in Delhi it was the excessively negative campaign against Kejri).

However, you also need to bear in mind that there are 2 states in MP and Gujarat where BJP has been winning for a long period of time. It is not a reflection of the BJP but a reflection of the leadership in these two states. As someone from Gujarat, I can attest personally that the work done has been phenomenal. Gujarat's social sector may be lacking but on the economic/infrastructure front it has done wonders.  Then in Goa, there are leaders like Manohar Parrikar who is considered to be one of the simplest and honest leaders in the BJP and in fact the Indian political scene. He has one bodyguard, lives a shack like building, and rides only a motorbike, travels in economy class etc. His work in Goa has also been appreciated a lot(lived in Goa for 4 years). 

My point is there are good leaders and bad leaders in political parties. You have Kumar Vishwas, Kejriwal, Sisodia in AAP(maybe more good people) and you have people like Modi, Parrikar, Shivraj Singh Chauhan(though popular seems to be embroiled in a scam now :(). 

Just because you have had one bad experience with one section of political party, it should not become the basis for judging every member of the political party. Also, if you are basing your opinions on Modi on media reports, I would suggest you travel to Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Baroda or Surat and see for yourself the development. Go to even a rural area if you want - and see for yourself how milkmen and villagers have been able to leverage proper power supply to sky rocket and scale their businesses. Most farmers are shifting to milk production as opposed to farming so even if agricultural yields drop Gujarat won't be affected much.

Finally, if you are a muslim I can understand the hate you have for the BJP. Maybe I would too. Fair play to you in that case. If you are a troll, then I would come across as an idiot. Anyway, cheers.

Regarding the 2002 riots, I don't know if Modi was guilty or not. Most supporters or haters take a side depending on their political leanings which is true for me also. But if we cannot respect the verdict of the Supreme court which gave its ruling under the Congress, who are we going to trust? The Media? I hope not. 

Regarding being skeptical of Gujarat, you can have an opinion. But I hope these opinions are formed after being well informed of the facts. I have lived in Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baroda, Patna, Jamshedpur, New Delhi, Goa for long periods of time. Maybe you should try visiting the state before forming an opinion. 

You may not want to visit the state but you cannot deny that Gujarat is the **only** power surplus state in the country, its manufacturing industry(thanks to diamond exports) is robust, has one of the highest GDP per capita(top 3 I think, correct me if I am wrong), is extremely safe - [link](http://ibnlive.in.com/news/shame-map-of-india-states-with-highest-rate-of-crimes-against-women/416615-53.html), has one of the most robust bureaucracies(can quote many world leaders on this) etc. 

There are many many good things about Gujarat and the work Mr. Modi has done. Can you deny that he does not work tirelessly for the country? Or that he is not enterprising? Or that his foreign policy has not been on point? Don't judge him only by giving him 9 months(though he has done very well in my eyes). A first time PM deserves at least more time before we start commenting on his performance.

Finally, on your point regarding Kejri - yeah, people like him. No doubt. He is doing things differently. But just because you are doing something differently doesn't mean it is right. In my opinion, his economics is very questionable. Good intentions, wrong actions.

Bewildering claim with no meaning, check - see ""pro-western"" and .... Nothing; about what that is supposed to mean or lead to. Selfish distortion of facts taken with glee on no backing, check - most of the article, with particular highlight ""80,000 people killed unreported by western media"" or any media for that matter attributing it to the current government, and clearly explained by OP - /hat tip again. Candidate for a mental asylum, no check even he cannot be helped - see Arundhati Roy being labelled as a great intellectual, I do not know enough about Sanjay Kak to say anything about him. Other things I might have missed, check - a pile of wank is sticky to sift through to get at everything.

I'm not a modi supporter I didn't and do not vote for the BJP, NOTA if you must know, but he has made positive moves that I do like but there is a side that does not impress me. make in India is confused about what it is supposed to be, smart cities is a bit of a joke, the revision of the GDP growth which is supposed to have an explanation so I keep it reserved but it is sketchy, the tsr subramaniam report on environmental laws a terrible piece of work and a poorly disguised excuse to dilute these laws, the pro hindutva statements of his party people which even if he doesn't do so, he should keep a leash on, etc. 

But all said and done he is doing some good things and I'm OK with him being at the helm rather than any of the other options, though I was just thinking about this, the HSBC black money thing, a step in the right direction but looks quite PR showy, that it wouldn't surprise me if it was the only one. After all the knowledge did not come through jaitley talking to swiss banks but through a leaked document showing that there were some HNI with swiss bank ac, but I digress. 

Right now he is doing some good stuff and I'm pretty OK with him being at the helm but reserve my judgement and have my doubts. Coming to this chap who wrote this piece. It is a hatchet job plain and simple, written from the off, conceived even before approaching these ""esteemed sources"" as to its direction and content. It cannot be taken as a credible piece of work, anyone willing to publish this has extremely dubious credibility, but the fucking problem is that it will. 

This is a completely incorrect and wrong view of what India is. But it is pieces like this that keep the perception of this beautiful country of mine as an uneducated, uncouth place, a place to be pitied that brings in the hordes of the naive simpleminded champagne socialists who come to spread their enlightened educated ways, who come for poverty and oppression tourism of real India while washing their backsides in distilled aquafina, and end it all screaming bloody murder that their experiences are gospel of the real india to us; we who are born, who live and who will most probably die here; that we are wrong that they know more about India from their experience of 4 weeks at a volunteer camp run by a letcherous greasy man just mind fucking them literally or to pinch their daddy's money in their pockets; and where they spend three of those four weeks complaining and whingeing about the depraved conditions they are having to live in - probably no A/C.  

Andre vltchek is one of these people, except its probably his on money in his case. If he is so worried about India's pro-western descent into depravity he might do a start and get out of that western place he calls home. I've had it with people like this.

In that case ""I will not recover the black money, just to emphasize how reluctant the Congress was in trying and how much there is abroad"", or ""I will not repeal section 66 of the IT act, just to show what idiots my predecessors were"", or even worse ""I will not try to tackle inflation, reduce corruption, or improve growth just so this country's plight can be a microcosm of Congress' failure.""

(2) WhatAmit Shah said to a reporter's question was referring to the second part as political rhetoric.

Yes. Promise of Vajpayee of completing the railway line.

&gt;The project was initiated by ABV but was almost entirely completed by the UPA. 

If Congress had ever wanted to build the line, it would have done ages ago. The project only gained steam after it was declared national project. The line Udhampur-Katra was supposed to complete in 2007. But it took more 7 years for it to happen, during UPA rule. May be technical dificulties. It is mountainous terrain after all. So can't really blame them. But Vajpaee did made the push. You can't lesson the contribution of likes of[ Lal, Bal and Pal,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_Lajpat_Rai) because they were gone much before India was free.

[Here is a brief history.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Railway)

1947: With partition, the Jammu-Sialkot Line was closed and Jammu is disconnected from Indian railways. A new line from Pathankot to Jammu had to be laid. It is proposed that this be extended to Srinagar but the preliminary survey of the Pir Panjal quickly squashed the thought, especially for a poor country with higher priorities.

**1983: The Prime Minister kicks off the line from Jammu Tawi to Udhampur. An optimistic schedule of five years and a budget of INR500 million (US$7.9 million) was set. As detailed below what happened to this line amply illustrates the wisdom of the earlier planners who had abandoned their plans when faced with reality.**

1994: The railway minister declared the need for a railway line to Baramulla and the Kashmir Valley. Upon further review it was revealed that this would be a 'hanging' railway running from Qazigund to Srinagar and on to Baramulla. The line from Katra to Qazigund through the mountains still looked unattainable.

**July 2002: The Central Government declares the line a National Project. This meant that it would be constructed and completed irrespective of cost funded entirely by the Central Government would fund the entire project. This was important, as the railways did not have the now estimated cost of INR60 billion (US$942.0 million) for the entire project. By the Indian Railways' allocation it would have taken 60 years to complete the project. A challenging deadline of 15 August 2007, Independence Day, was also set.**

13 April 2005: The 53 km (33 mi) long Jammu-Udhampur line is inaugurated, 21 years and INR5.15 billion (US$80.9 million) after its commencement, marking the completion of ""Leg 0"".[3][4] The line had 20 major tunnels and 158 bridges. Its longest tunnel was 2.5 km (1.6 mi) and its highest bridge was 77 m (253 ft) - the highest railway bridge in India. This is in the relatively easy Shivalik Hills.

2008: The Ministry of Railways ordered cancellation of the project on the existing alignment between Katra and Qazigund, due to suspected geological instabilities. It instructed Konkan Railway to stop all work on the section, including the Chenab Bridge, and to terminate all contracts issued for work on the section, pending consideration of major changes in the alignment.[5][6]

The Railway Board constitutes a high-level committee to examine the feasibility of ""Leg 2"" of the project and to rework the alignment through the Pir Panjal Mountains,[7] proposing to undertake a fresh survey for construction of the line on a shorter alignment.[8]

11 October 2008: The first isolated section of 66 km (41 mi) between Manzhama and Anantnag on Leg 3 inaugurated, 14 months behind schedule. The train service will operate twice a day in either direction. Complications continues to plague the connection to the plains.[9][10]

14 February 2009: The train service on Leg 3 was extended to Baramulla.[11][12]

June 2009: Work on the section between Katra and Qazigund resumed after the committee set up to review the alignment approved the existing one with minor changes.[13] Additional geo-technical tests of the rock strata and changes to other portions of the alignment changes were to be reviewed.[14]

28 October 2009: The 18 km (11 mi) long section from Anantnag to Qazigund was inaugurated by the prime minister marking the completion of Leg 3.[15]

2011-12: Boring of the new 11.215 km (7-mile) long Banihal-Qazigund tunnel connecting Bichleri Valley of Banihal with Qazigund in Kashmir Valley completed in October 2011, its lining and laying of rail tracks was completed in the next one year and trial run commenced on 28 December 2012.

2013: Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel and Banihal station opened.

9 December 2013: The trial train arrives at Katra.

**11 June 2014 : A trial train from Delhi arrived prior to the inauguration of the Udhampur-Katra line and the Katra Railway Station.**

4 July 2014 : The train journey on Udhampur-Katra line was officially inaugurated by the Prime Minister. The train is named ""Shree Shakti Express""

360,"&gt;how do you define AAP? Ideologically?

I don't see anything developed cogently as yet. And their idea of Swaraj, as I could make out from their manifesto, does not sit well with the existing system of administration. It is also not clear as to whether it is a model of their *own* self-governance or that of the government that they would provide when given an opportunity. 

I've read conflicting accounts of either and, if that be the case, we/they do not know if that will demonstrably enhance efficiency of governance/their own administration without creating problems of its own.

They certainly cannot throw away a couple of centuries of public administration systems as well as constitutionally enshrined mechanisms of government based on some idealistic notions cobbled together hastily into a manifesto. I think they need to accept the need for some expertise in political as well as public administration. And take its advice seriously. 

If that calls for telling their voters that their model has undergone changes upon deliberate review, it would be a sign of political maturity; so they should not hung up on idiotic things such as - *this is different from our founding principles/ideas so we won't do it/how will we face our voters?*.

...

As far as the specific point of ideology goes, I read a piece recently about how AAP actually mirrors the citizen protests in the Middle-East and Occupy movements of the West (though the triggers for each may be different). So I don't really expect them to revisit old paradigms when the demands of the people are something else, as they have gleaned. Kejriwal is being justifiably cautious when he says that AAP is not yet ready for the national stage - he hopes to buy time to address this question before he targets the hinterland.

CORRUPTION not RESERVATION is the root of all evils. Here it goes. Reservation is used as divide &amp; rule policy.

1) It all started with Indus civilization, the Aryan race came &amp; destroyed the dam over Indus river and started the people of India making salves as they had fighting weapons &amp; had script &amp; literature.  
People of India was uneducated, no weapons, no education, no strategic and tactical minds, they were just farmers and skilled peace loving people.


2) These people acquired all the lands &amp; start treating these people as slaves. In Sanskrit there is a word called Dashu, that means Das (slave) as well as Dushman(Enemy). Later on as various emperor kept these so call aryan people as strategy maker and made rules like, these sc/sc people can't keep any lands, money, no education etc. They made rules like a King can only award lands to Brahman, that's why Brahmans had 100s of acres of land in most of the villages. That's why Chak-Bandi was provisioned in article 6 of Constitution to give small piece of agriculture land to these sc/sc people, but due to corruption of aryan race (Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaisya) it was not implemented properly. Because of this the Maiost problem started. Even in Madeavial India rules were made to pour boiling lead in ears, chop off limbs of sc/st people. To add more problems to c/st a new Varna Kayastha was made to integrate the other 3 to work against Shudra varna.


3) In ancient times, Chanakya has written Arthshastra etc to form strategy &amp; tactics to win over anything and go to any lenght to get the mission fulfilled wither by hook of crook, that's why a saam, daam, dand, bhed  साम, दाम, दंण्ड, भेद culure got imbibed in India, which is today known as Corruption. During British time thies also added by ""Devide and rule"" policy, in that also this aryan race places a big role. British started election process in Indian around 1930. For British it was not economically viable to do business in India around 1945, but some of the Mediator came in and paved corrupt people like Nehru prime minister. In Education System Mahatma was studied as father of Nation, though actually being a middle man. Dandi-March he did for Businessman to remove taxes on salt. The man freedom fighter were made to be killed, so that they can't claim anything in Independent India.


4) When British was about to leave india, then Gandhi become the middle men and agreed to handover Shubhash Chandra Bose, Chandra Shekar Azad and others to them. Before Dr. Amdedkar wanted dual vote system in ""Poona Pact"" for this sc/sct community, because he know that these Aryan race will utilize the sc/st politician for their own use, so he wanted that a dalit politician will be elected through first voting among them, then he will represent them in a better way. But Mahatma Gandhi knew that they can't use this politician selected by poor, so he opposed, so much of it, that Ambedkar then suggested reservation system, whichi Gandhi approved. But this reservation is also not implemented properly, because these corrupt people keeps reserved vacant saying no suitable candidate found. I got 2 govt jobs once in a public sector other in a autonomous body, both time it was back-log vacancy, used to filled sc/st empty seats.


5) This caste system is so much prevailed in india, then you have to fill religion, caste in school admission form. During study these sc/st people are given less number, so that there % is always kept low. In some of the exams interviews is only because that these candidates can be rejected. Even once they join the are so much discriminated that even IAS people leave their jobs after a few years.


6) So to know the actual problems of India, you have to look it from sc/st angle. And these sc/st people never had a religion. Actually it is being done strategically to keep people poor in india, so that they keep on suicide, but be available to work on cheapest rated. So much grains are wasted/ruined, but not available to poor.


7) For Siphoning black money there are NGOs, Temples, Ashrams, Organisations, Fake companies. In villages, a sc/st is not even allowed to shit, then how come they get bribe. black money. Some of the sc/st are also very corrupt, because  they are made part of the system. Foreigner call this country asshole? why? Why so much research is done on India? Why there 'r news in papers that India has only followers no leader, in current centuries. 


8) Do you know that Reliance used to convert International call to local calls 15 years back, you know that Reliance total worth increased to 60 fold in last 10 years. Modi being to Gandhi (Vaishya) caste is doing good only to Bussiness-man/Industrialist. Natural gas production was reduced, so that it can be sold at higher rates, no matter if country suffers lack of power generation or stay under-developed. Average Indian are kept/made fools, because they are strategically kept busy in struggling with the system, so that they hardly get time to know &amp; understand what is happening in india.


9) The actual problem with India is that people look upto Politician/Govt for their needs to be fulfilled( absolutely right). but these corrupt politician/officials know better that how much partial needs to be fulfilled to get there votes. And since there is very less political options available in india.


10) Anyone try to be a Reformer in India, and he will be assassinated first. A good politician will be murdered first by bad politician. Why economics, law &amp; Order is not studied in schools, because people can't be more practiced. Why skills, entrepreneur-ship is not taught.


11) The problem of Indian system is too Complex, because it needs a religious, economy, people, law &amp; order and political reforms. India can not even become a developed country, not to talk about Super power. Right now Modi is going to develop it as a low cost manufacturing hubs. All National resources (citizen's property) are being given to Businessmen in the name of development. In next 10 years most of the India's resource owner will be only 3%  people of this country. This people get Share of National Resources, and average indian get a news of it.

12) The less you try to dig about India the better, else you will start feeling ashamed of being in Indian. There are solution to these problem, but...

13) Dr. Ambedkar as a law minister, propsed Hindu Code bill, to improve that situation of woman in India, because if a woman develop, her whole family develop, whole country develop. But it was not implemented. Right were not given to women. India could have became Super-power in just 30-40 years, if policies of Ambedkar had been implemented. He was a great economist, reformer, law maker, policy maker, but was side-lined by Nehru and framed to loose 3 elections.  He was such an scholar, he used to study whole night at a stretch. That is only reason he strategy is studied and being admired upper class people. And even some of the fore-cast he did, even holds true after 60-70 years. He framed that Nationalization of Agriculture in India, but not implemented, that's why farmers suicide, but who cares..

Two reasons. 'Serious' 'allegations' can be raised about and against just about anybody by anyone at any time for any purpose. You do not go about responding to such stuff, in the media. It only gets worse. He has got to consider his position as the CM of Delhi vis-a-vis internal party leadership matters (especially when conflicted). The other thing is that these letters draw attention of the NEC/PAC to issues/problems which are to be expected or experienced for (re)solutions. So far, there is nothing substantial other than projections of a need to strengthen party administration and regulate its functioning. There is also a difference of opinion on the leadership structure.

And he's made that embarrassment public. That's the clear message. Senior leaders have used the media for communicating their dissatisfaction over issues, which are ideally thrashed out within the confines of the party. It has resulted in drawing unnecessary negative attention to the organization which needs to get its act together to govern Delhi.

&gt;By taking a 10-day naturopathy vacation? Forget AAP, Delhi needs him! His honeymoon period has barely begun and he's already taking vacations?? In an earlier post you hoped he would follow Modi's examples/plays. This is a complete departure from the kind of hard work we've seen Modi put in.

Come on. I searched for and didn't find any mention of the vacation. Not that it matters. 

Even if it were true, why should we grudge him that? He's worked ceaselessly for the past six months. He's achieved something in the elections and, going by his Social Media outreach, set the ball rolling for his bureaucrats and executive machinery. And when else would he take a vacation, other than in his honeymoon?

And, as regards Modi, he's already borrowed quite a few approaches. He cannot be accused of shying away from hard work as yet. I didn't say he would become Modi.

&gt;What's to be seen is whether this struggle will leave us with a stronger AAP or a weaker one.

I daresay it will be stronger. But it will no longer be what it started out as. I found [this interesting interview](http://www.firstpost.com/politics/arvind-kejriwal-is-not-an-angry-man-or-a-socialist-858861.html) of a year back ...

He said ‘We will become sullied’. I told him, if we get dirty that will be our sacrifice— that we pledged our reputation to get in’.*

I sometimes feel we get distracted by the need for difference in ideologies, when we want to talk of something new, often glossing over emerging forms of political organization and demands.

My confidence allows me to predict that AAP will jettison ideological issues to the extent of sidelining Prashant Bhushan and Shanti Bhushan (I feel it will take the risk of their exit and further media noise). Yogendra Yadav will accept whatever comes his way.",2015-03-03 14:52:51

Direction? I think he's already identified areas of attention and established specific task-forces as of a day or so back. He's looking at what he appears to have identified as demands of the people. He may need to look at what role he plays in the functioning of the party though. I'm not able to hazard a guess as to what that might be. I'd prefer him to relinquish the position of the NC though. It's a distraction.

439,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's is
a neo-Vedantic Hindu
interpretation of Indian secularism
Is Sarva Dharma Samabhava Back?
Editorial, The Economic and
Political Weekly, Vol - L No. 9,
February 28, 2015
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's is
a neo-Vedantic Hindu
interpretation of Indian
secularism.
The US President Barack Obama
drove home the message twice,
first, on the way to winding up his
three-day visit to India, in New
Delhi on 27 January, and then,
once more, at a high-profile
National Prayer Breakfast on 5
February in Washington. At the
first, his so-called “parting shot,”
he referred to the Indian
Constitution when he said that
“Your Article 25 says all people are
equally entitled to the freedom of
conscience and have the right to
freely profess, practice and
propagate religion,” going on to
emphasise that “upholding
freedom of religion is the utmost
responsibility of the government.”
Nine days later, perhaps surmising
that his reference to the
Constitution did not have the
desired effect, he appealed to
Gandhian ideals, calling attention
to “acts of (religious) intolerance
that would have shocked Gandhiji,
the person who helped to liberate
that nation.”
In the course of Obama’s visit,
Modi, in his gold monogrammed,
personalised suit, kept referring to
the US president by his first name,
Barack, even as the president
remained consistent in his plain,
prim and proper response, “Mr
Modi.” Maybe that was Obama’s
way of hinting that he had
something up his sleeve which he
still had to deliver — reminding
the Prime Minister of India of his
failure to uphold the
constitutionally guaranteed
fundamental right to freedom of
religion. Modi was embarrassed by
Obama on 27 January; it took him
quite a while to speak about it (i
e, freedom of religion), even about
the Indian version of secularism in
the form of sarva dharma
samabhava (equal respect for all
religions).
But eventually, talk he did, 12 days
after Obama evoked Gandhian
ideals to drive home the message.
Modi’s Indian critics, clearly
unimpressed, asked him to now
“walk the talk,” which he is yet to
do; unlikely, we think, because that
would involve the union
government taking necessary action
against the likes of the president
of the Vishva Hindu Parishad,
Pravin Togadia, indeed, even
against the sarsanghchalak of the
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
, Mohan Bhagwat. With one of his
pracharaks as the Prime Minister of
India, Bhagwat has been counting
on being given a free hand in
playing his role as Raj Guru (the
prince’s counsellor) and in
fulfilling the RSS mission of
regenerating Indian society and
restoring the nation’s vitality.
What could be better than the
ghar wapsi exercises? After all, the
Other, the prodigal, needs to be
brought back, by any and all
available means, to the ghar, the
Hindu religion, and the nation,
which is claimed to be that of the
Hindus, but only after a shuddhi
(purification) ceremony, for these
Others have been defiled by
Christianity and Islam, and
therefore they need to be cleansed
before bringing them back to the
ghar in the jati (caste) quarters of
their origins.
Excerpts from Modi’s speech at a
“national celebration” of the
elevation to sainthood of a priest
and a nun from Kerala on 17
February at which he proclaimed
his government’s commitment to
Indian secularism, namely, “equal
respect and treatment for all
faiths,” are intriguing. The
Constitution’s principle of
secularism, Modi states, has its
“roots in the ancient cultural
traditions in India,” and now, if
the prime minister is to be
believed, following what is “in the
DNA of every Indian,” “the rest of
the world too is evolving along the
lines of ancient India.” The
problem with all of this is that the
kind of secularism deriving from
Vedic times and “values” has no
resemblance to what is understood
as secularism in the post-
Enlightenment world. The former, a
revivalist secularism, is oozing with
religiosity, even as the “secular”
Indian state sets itself up as the
underwriter of all faiths with its
chief executive affirming the glory
of Hinduism.
In this sense, as India becomes
more secular, it becomes more
Hindu, with neo-Vedantic Hinduism
being claimed not merely as a
religion but a way of life of all
Indians, the latter, aka the
Supreme Court’s infamous ruling
on Hindutva. If the Prime Minister
is to be taken at face value,
Hindus, from time immemorial
have been uniquely tolerant. And,
when he wants the rest of the
world to “evolve along the lines of
Ancient India,” he sees the need
for Christianity and Islam, the
world’s other major religions, to be
secularised along the lines of neo-
Vedantic Hinduism, into a
pluralistic, “rational,” open-
minded, tolerant “way of life.” He
also believes that other states of
the world can be truly “secular” if
they embrace the now uniquely
Hindu way of life. Of course, the
claim that neo-Vedantic Hinduism
offers an open-minded, tolerant
way of life does not correspond to
the reality of Hindutvavadi cultural
policing in the service of this
Hindu orthodoxy, even attacking
those who expose its self-serving
myths, a recent instance of which
is the assassination of the
Communist Party of India leader
Govind Pansare, author of Shivaji
Kon Hota? (Who Was Shivaji?),
which tells the truth about the
17th century Maratha warrior.
Surely Modi has speech-writers
who are good copycats of the likes
of Sita Ram Goel and N S Rajaram.
With Hindu nationalism and
patriotism on a new high in the
political and cultural realms, the
struggle to defend science and
reason is going to be a long and
hard one.",2015-03-03 16:05:48
440,"You don't understand economics as well as you think you do. Inflation is a good macroindicator in very specific circumstances because it is a byproduct of liquidity which frees up credit.

But when inflation is driven up by supply side constraints (as it was in India) rather than credit growth or money printing it [absolutely hurts the poor](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/the-15-most-miserable-economies-in-the-world) by eroding purchasing power, as it did before Rajan and Jaitley rescued India from catastrophic failure. See Argentina, Zimbabwe and India between 2010 and 2014.

441,"I have no problem with your description of the evolution of the party. And there is no disagreement with the claim its foundational principles are being challenged.

Let's take the two examples you have offered. VS13, they were against the Congress. It was not a personality clash as yet. However the situation was completely different in VS15. As I have already commented before, AAP found it possible to meet the Modi challenge by cultivating a personality-based approach in response.

Now there are two takeaways from this. Either AAP will decide that it will re-organize itself based on every challenge that it faces or it will find that this latter model is what works best, when offering an alternative to the Modi machine. They may or may not be able to broker an effective peace/harmonious compromise with their principles, based on this 'supremo' model. It remains to be seen what they do.

&gt;Same case can be made for their ideology and how it is going from radically different (anti corruption) to bog standard (""secular"" politics).

Anti-corruption is not so radically different. And then they have not washed their hands off this. Elimination of corruption remains a major focus of their manifesto. As far as the rest is concerned, they have a secular appeal and have capitalized on that (why shouldn't they?). They've chosen to concentrate on citizen demands (however ideologically inconsistent or random) and it is fair that they be allowed to do so, if it works to make life easier for those who voted for them. Again, they may or may not be able to derive a coherent ideology but that should be no reason to dismiss them as yet.
