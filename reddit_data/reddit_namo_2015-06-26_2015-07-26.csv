2,"Expose of Fake allegations against Pankaja Munde - The NaMo Patrika

---

&gt;* Allegation : The purchase was approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha

&gt;* Reality : The rate contract was approved on verification of all the points associated with the manufacturing units of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha by the Technical Team of the CSPO.

&gt;* The water filter with storage capacity has been purchased and therefore the allegations made in this regard are baseless and misleading for the people.

&gt;* As per the Terms and Conditions mentioned in the Tender, The Commissioner (Integrated Child Development Scheme) has the rights to change the quantity of the Medicines and the cost of Medical Kit was reduced to Rs.599/- from Rs.

&gt;* These purchases are done on the basis of the Rate Contracts finalized by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS &amp; D) of the Industries Department and Central Government.

3,"Again.. no denial was ever made that there wasn't any business links between LM and Raje family.  Also Raje deal was few years back.. it has come out just now.  We seem to have trials in media even before any concrete evidence is present, may it be ""Islamic Terrorists"", ""Bodo Terrorists"" ""Hindu terrorists"" or politicians scandals.  Our media and public want to pass judgement and castigate them for life.   Which makes it difficult for litigators to get a fair justice as already a bias is built on judgement one way or other.  Burden of proof is with people that are alleging not the person that is defending themselves.  This is how it works every where else.  If there is enough proof to indict SS, VR or even NaMo, they should resign and put behind bars until then let investigators gather information for the case.. 

SS issue is when she is foreign minister, if I read it right.  Also, Congress dragged its feet to completely see the issue through due their own compulsions (money and/or favors, which are coming out now).  No open cases.  

LM played the system well!  No wonder he could build a very popular product even when there was so much saturation of cricket.. don't you think a lot of cost was involved both with in the country and other cricketing country boards to make it this big a success?",2015-06-27 00:45:08

You are running a race. Some people are ahead, some people are behind. You can not stop running. If you do so, you lag behind the other countries.

Ask Narendra Modi. Just because someone supports someone doesn't mean they will know 110% of his ideology and thoughts. We have to ask this to Narendra Modi and not his supporters.

This is what most folks on this reddit do not realize. At this time, he is the least worst option that we have and that is why you see his supporters.

I have said it many times. He does not deliver and these same supporters will do a U-Turn on him in no time. 

Till then, you have to show patience. What do you expect him to do? 

Fire Chauhan and Raje overnight? Whole Rajasthan and MP which are guaranteed BJP bastions might be lost. And they may go and join hands with UPA in 2019 - you never know.

Most regional units of each national party are individual parties in their own right - with different state leaders. No changes are possible overnight, but yes - gradually change will happen. Old guard will give way to new guard - as has happened at the national level.

And for your concerns about other options, yes those options are weak at this time. We can only hope that some new leaders rise or morph !! Yes morph!!

NaMo was nothing more than a tribal leader - ruling his own state like a king a couple of years ago - but he transformed himself into a national leader. 5 years ago - nobody cared for NaMo - but he has a pan-india appeal today.

If any of the leaders you mention, have to rise - then they have to transform too. But, unfortunately, most of them are limited by their own weaknesses. 

NaMo took a risk - had he failed in ensuring BJP's win. His own political career would have gone. Do any of the other leaders you mention have that to take that risk (other than RaGa - he has nothing to lose) 

So, it is all complicated. As you say, at this time and given situation, BJP is the best option we have. We can only hope that they improve as with our expectations or some other party rises to that challenge. 

Till that time - focus on the positives at the national level (as in personal life too) . That is the only way, life will become bearable. ",2015-07-07 09:48:33

&gt;Did you know that there is no single figure for the number of so called “mysterious deaths” that all the media outlets agree on ?

Did you know that you should not believe reports from a propaganda outlet. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyapam_scam#Deaths

Each and every death related to the scam is chronicled here, and supported with a proof. Of course, I don't accept the NitiCentral staff to come across this link. Their internet probably has filters which restricts them for viewing anything against their dear leader and his party. 

&gt;Did you know that of the so called “mysterious deaths” the media has counted 2 who died of Cancer, one who died of Brain Haemorrhage, one for Liver Infection, 2 for Alcoholism and 1 for suffering a Cardiac Arrest ?

Did you know that still leaves 30 people who might not have died of natural causes. Do you know that even if one person was murdered to keep secrets from spilling out, it is one death too may? 

&gt;Did you know that the media has listed 5 as “unaccounted deaths” with no information on either the alleged role or cause of death ?

&gt;* The sudden surge in activity on an otherwise lazy Twitter day, was all about the anatomy of Internet trolls  an article by novelist Chetan Bhagat.

&gt;* In the last few months, or should we say since the advent of a brand called NaMo, the discussion on trolls has moved from private conversations to mainstream media.
