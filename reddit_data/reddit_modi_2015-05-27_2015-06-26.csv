That applies in even larger terms to all the Vibrant Gujarat deals inked by Modi. The deals inked by Modi amount to more than the FDI that went into China in the same period.


If you think BJP is a party of saints that don't work for vested interests  you are even more delusional than the ones trying to whitewash Congress's sins.

VSNL was practically gifted away to the Tatas in the name of ""divestment"" by the last NDA govt.

There are virtues to speaking softly and carrying a big stick.

6,"Nobody wants more scams, but the way our political system works they cannot be avoided.

It costs many crores of rupees to merely campaign for an MP seat.

BJP/NDA has been out of power for 2 terms and have spent a ton of money in the last 3 general elections. They'll need to find ways to recover all the money that was spent. And by the time they have broken even, they'll need to find ways to fund their 2019 campaign.

Assuming BJP alone contested around 400 seats in each election..  and didn't violate election spending rules that's 1200 campaigns at ~70 lakhs each of just legal expenses. They are already down 840 crores. (In reality it costs multiple crores of spending for each seat, so they are probably down 2400 crores or more.)

Now that the Supreme Court has banned the govt. from using govt. money to run ads featuring any politician other than the PM/President, various MPs and Ministers cannot get free publicity in print/television/digital media on govt. expense.

Where is the money for all those ads going to come from?

Such a load of hogwash - Ashok Leyland and Bharat Forge have grown by 300%, does it mean they are also ""Modi agents"" or Modi is an agent for these guys?

Some random company called VTS INDS gained by 1400%, so they are all Modi agents?

VSNL? Market cap of VSNL when the deal was done was around 10,000 crores. Tata got 25% of the shares for ~ Rs 3,000 crores. 25% of the shares for roughly 30% of the then market value.

I take objection to some of your unnecessary references here.

Firstly, no political party pays me. But I am a BJP supporter, apart from a few mishits here and there, under Modi BJP IS the best positioned party to lead India. FYI, I was never a supporter when Advani was its Leader. 

Getting praise from your philosophical opponent is not a bad thing, in fact it shows the caliber, hence positive articles on TIME, editor being - Fareed Zakaria whose father was known congress bigwig, WILL be projected by BJP supporters and rightly so. If Arnab Goswami praises Rahul Gandhi, it is noteworthy! Its not great for Barkha to praise Kejriwal. It would be great if Ambani was to praise Kejriwal for Kejriwal's pro-poor/honest business policies. Other words, if praise comes from your worst critics, then you did something wonderful - applied to this positive time magazine!

Also, The charges of communal violence on modi are really not worth noting. There is a reason for that....

India has had 1000s of communal riots in the past 350 years. You cannot attribute every riot to every leader in power, unless there is substantial proof determined by courts or existing judicious minds. 

Most of the negative articles are funny because many refer to US banning his VISA. Here's why it is funny. Of all the dictators that existed in the world since the WW II , only one leader was banned from entering the US under the allegations that he had spread religious riots. Only one! Even the Obama administration laughed at it when they reviewed it. The reason why this drama against modi in the western countries succeeded is because of anti-hindu people who are bred by western money. Not saying governments of the west are anti-hindu. please don't mistake me. Its some companies/NGOs and vested interest groups. Take Rajdeep for example. He was affiliated with CNN-IBN for so long, made so much money, so he has to stay loyal. Arundhati Roy - spews venom against hindus and Indian state, earns a lot in the west.

[Livemint](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html)

&gt;&gt;Between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, there were 60.7 million new jobs that were created as against 2.76 million new jobs between 2004-05 to 2009-10.

My conclusion?

&gt;Total * NDA : 60.85 * UPA : 2.72 - My NDA figure is off by (-)0.15 Mn and the UPA figure is off by + 0.04 Mn.

Close enough.

Or do you believe Livemint also is wrong.

[Here is Firstpost saying the exact same thing](http://www.firstpost.com/business/economy/nsso-shocker-sonianomics-continues-to-damage-jobs-893843.html),

&gt;&gt;The only ray of hope lies in one number: in the last two years (ended January 2012), despite slowing growth, the UPA did manage to push up employment by 13.9 million, as against the increase of just around 2.7 million during UPA-1 (2004-09). During the NDA period, over 60 million jobs were created despite slower growth.

It seems as though the UPA managed to add another 13 Mn in their second term pushing their total to ~ 16 Mn in a decade. The planning commission data ended in 2010 and hence I couldn't add this into my analysis.

Here is [Firstpost](http://www.firstpost.com/business/economy/upa-nomics-may-be-killing-jobs-and-job-quality-too-516082.html) saying the same thing, though they come up with a figure of 90Mn new jobs during the NDA era

&gt;&gt;Looking at data for the period between 1999-00 and 2004-05 and between 2004-05 and 2009-10, this is what Crisil found: in the first period (broadly corresponding to NDA rule), even though GDP growth was lower, employment was robust - with the economy creating 92.7 million new jobs - 27.2 million regular jobs, and 65.5 million through self-employment. The slower growth may have goaded people to look harder for jobs.
During the next five-year period (from 2004-05 to 2009-10), the net addition to jobs was a measly 2.2 million. How did this happen? While normal job creation remained more or less the same (27.7 million), self-employed jobs crashed by 25.5 million, yielding a net job addition of just 2.2 million.

The UPA era number remains constant at ~ the 2.5 Mn mark +/- factors considering.

[Here is a CRISIL report](http://www.crisil.com/pdf/corporate/EmploymentInsight_CRISILResearch_Aug2011.pdf?bcsi_scan_70ca681ff4cc8034=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=EmploymentInsight_CRISILResearch_Aug2011.pdf) saying the same thing,


&gt;&gt; 
Employment can be broadly divided into two categories - jobs (salaried and casual) and self employed. The 
estimates based on a recent NSSO report released in June 2011 indicate that overall employment in India 
increased by 2.2 million between 2005 and 2010 as against 92.7 million between 2000 and 2005

Crisil though arrives at 90Mn for the NDA eta, but note the UPA era number.

The CRISIL report further down (Table 3) gives you sectoral percentages. Agriculture? -8.2%. Manufacturing? -6.3% which goes against /u/rahulthewall's assertion that manufacturing created new jobs. Construction? 70% increase in jobs which is precisely what I have been saying.

[Here is the Pioneer](http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/edi/upas-jobless-growth.html),

&gt;&gt; This goes hand-in-hand with the fact that in the first five years of the previous decade (during most of which the BJP-led NDA was at the helm) as many as 60 million new jobs were created, even though the growth rate was actually lower at that time. In the second half of the decade, under the aegis of the Congress-led UPA Government and when the growth rate was in fact inching towards double digits, only 2.7 million new jobs were added. Of course, the incumbent regime will be quick to point out that the latest survey shows that since 2010, it has created 13.9 million jobs. And while that does offer a silver lining, it is one that is paper-thin and clouded by the poor quality of jobs created.

Again, this data includes the 13.9 Mn jobs created in UPA II, for which I do not have data points. 

The Pioneer like Livemint and Firspost though point out that the quality of jobs was abysmal and mostly in the construction sector.

&gt;&gt;More than nine million of the new jobs created in those two years were the less desirable blue-collar work — mostly in construction — while employment in the manufacturing sector actually dropped. On the contrary, during the NDA years, the proportion of the labour force engaged in casual jobs fell.

Do you have any independent source that substantiates your claim of the UPA having created 30 Mn new jobs in 2004-10?",2015-05-28 14:34:17

He has an opinion on everything and turns even the simplest of conversations into a political debate, issues of caste etc. His associates are much the same. Half baked understanding of issues coupled with a strong conviction that they are a monopoly on the truth. This group is actively involved in political campaigning and other such activities *outside* the campus. I believe a couple of them have even taken part in the kudankulam nuclear power plant protests. They are also members of the SFI or other such groups that have a student political agenda. They have been trying to drum up and discuss these issues inside campus as well. 

Now, having political opinions are fine. God knows, we have enough of them. But iitm has a policy of disallowing such overtly political activism inside campus. It is simply too dangerous to allow such groups and their associated shenanigans ranging from rivalry to violence inside the campus. The experiences of other campuses serve as a cautionary tale. The reason this group has been derecognised is not because they were critical of modi but because they were seeking to politicise certain social issues that are sensitive and require delicate handling. They were not far away from dangerously vitating the atmosphere in a hitherto apolitical campus. My friend was even talking of holding a rally. These relevant social issues di need discussion, but by being overtly political and bringing in ambedkar and periyar into the picture, thus group crossed a hidden gtlaxman rekha in iitm.

145,"Haha, downvote harder, guys. You can do it. Who needs to hear this side of the story, anyway? 


Bullet points from the student group's response:


&gt; 1. It has been alleged that we have spread hatred against the Modi government and a copy of our pamphlet on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti was enclosed. We do not see any merit in such a statement. We stand by our opinions. Yes, we were very critical of the government. However, we do not understand how dissent and criticism of the government’s policy is akin to “spreading hatred”. If any person professing an anti-establishment view is accused of engaging in “controversial” activities and all dissent is stifled, wouldn’t that be a violation of our constitutionally guaranteed rights to freely express ourselves? We feel that a vibrant and proactive civil society is an integral part of a healthy democracy. IITM itself have had many meetings that discussed the policies and legislation’s of the current and previous elected governments. Among them the reservation policy is the one which has not been still implemented in IITM campus. Here we want to raise a rational question on IITM’s stand on the reservation policy which is still an alive Government policy even in Modi Government since Independence. When OBC reservation was announced by then Govt., whether anti-reservation student group of IITM simply sat without commending because that its ‘government’s policy’ or it fought against it on the streets of Chennai with its tooth and nail to stop that move? What was the action taken by IITM towards those who fought on streets against the Govt. Policy on Reservation? Rather, the IITM took part in negotiating a raise of 24% to safeguard the vested interested of those anti-reservation body functioning in IITM?

&gt; 2. We have been accused of spreading hatred between SC-ST and the Hindus and vitiating the atmosphere of the institute. We are surprised and slightly amused. Are SC, ST not part of the so called ‘Hindus’? How MHRD and IITM is perceiving such a venomous anonymous mail with full of hatred towards the SC, ST and Ambedkar? Are we the one who polarise the students or they are the one who think IITM is their own base to propagate against the interest of SC, ST, OBC who are the majority in our Society? Rather our organization is engaged in propagating Ambedkar and Periyar thoughts, in helping depressed castes and the caste Hindus to realize the evilness of caste based discrimination taking place in modern India and expose the ideology functioning behind such discrimination. When we talk about the hierarchical caste structure existing in Indian Society, inevitably we end up in talking about the present pathetic condition of peasants and labours. There are a number of sociological studies that will bear us out when we say that caste based discrimination is still very strong in our society, that caste based associations can leave some with privileges that add up throughout their lives while those that are excluded face powerful social barriers to their attempts to improve their social and economic status. We have only been discussing these issues with an aim to make a common platform for all students in spite of their caste and creed so as to dismantle the evilness of caste barriers. However, even in 2015, our activities are seen to be too radical by the religious right. If the religious right has the right to be offended, then don’t the oppressed Dalits and Bahujans who still face powerful prejudices have a right to be offended with the state of affairs? Our pamphlets do not have any material that would surprise a sociological or political scientist. Yet, the institute has taken these complaints seriously and has chosen to derecognise our organisation. Any higher education institute should be a platform where critical thinking and dissent ought to be encouraged. Where brave new thoughts are nurtured. However, the “dangerous” ideas that we have been accused of spreading are at least a few decades old, if not a few centuries.

&gt; 3. The complainant has taken exception to one of our meetings which dealt with an MHRD circular regarding vegetarian and non-vegetarian mess halls. We do not understand how anybody’s sentiments could have been hurt when the entire discussion was about the right of every individual to decide what they can eat. This meeting could be seen as trivial when compared to the meetings on much larger issues. However, the complaint against this meeting indicates how unsparing the dominant establishment has become when it comes to stifling dissent. If such a trivial freedom such as being able to eat meat in the mess halls is seen as dangerous, then the continued existence of our study group becomes all the more important.

&gt; 4. Another issue that the complainant has taken exception to is a meeting that discussed language politics and the primacy given to Sanskrit and Hindi in the disbursement of central funds. We had a Linguist from HSS, IITM and a linguistic scholar from Pondicherry University who led the discussion. As rationalists, we feel that though Sanskrit has a valued place as part of culture and history of certain sections of our society, it is also an instrument of spreading a Brahminical, dominant narrative. Imposition of Sanskrit in school has less to do with teaching a language and more to do with the ideology behind teaching the language. We stand by our opinions and wish to assert our rights to profess our opinions freely.

&gt; 5. Finally, we have been accused of getting funds from the outside organization. This allegation is completely baseless and absurd. So far for all the programs the financial support had been taken from the study circle members’ own pockets and collected in paisas from IITM students at their doorsteps which was witnessed even by those who wrote the above said ‘anonymous pettition’. Why we had to collect in paisas from the students to conduct our events through a platform like APSC is because IITM rejected many of our moves to bring personalities like Prof. Chaman Lal through EML. Since its birth, EML is been the monopoly of religious right wing to propagate their metaphysical idealist ideology and is a platform for corporate think tanks in the scientific and academic fraternity. When the taxpayers money is been spend for propogating anti-people, anti-rational agenda, pro –people, rational groups like APSC have to collect money from the students to conduct its events. We are maintaining proper account for all our expenditures.

Bad journalism = having some sort of bias or desired 'result' (e.g. Modi is a great PM or Modi is a terrible PM, etc.) and with that in minding filtering out the important facts and forming your desired story.

You can spin that as 'Modi spends crores on more foreign trips', 'Modi signs landmark deal with Korea', or 'Modi ignores pressing [X,Y,Z] at home to go on foreign holiday in Korea', etc. A good story would include aspects of all of those stories in proper context (e.g. spending 500 cr. on a foreign trip is only a big deal if, say, it normally costs 300 cr. or something).",2015-05-30 00:07:22

But think of this a company... an enterprise if you will. The CEO of the company has a few constituents: shareholders, customers and employees. 

The *shareholders* decide whether CEO is doing a good job... in this case the public. And hypothetically decide whether CEO should remain in his/her job. 

The *employees* ensure that the company runs based on the vision and direction of the CEO and his management team. The CEO is there to provide direction, guidance and to take the tough decisions.

The *customers* are the people that are buying your products. These are the people you need to convince to buy, sometimes you need to meet them to shake hands and often times to make them feel important. As the CEO, you're not doing the nuts and bolts with the customers either. But you are needed to show that your company regards them as important. 

The PM is the over-seer. His job is to give direction and review the work of the council of ministers. His job is to enable others to do their job effectively. 

On the insurgencies... I am not 60 years old to have seen India over the years... but a) there is a talk of firm handed approach with the next door neighbour. b) there is also the biggest inclusive project for North-East India, which has often been treated like a step-child. I don't think much has been done vis-a-vis naxals. 

b) I don't know what the reality is on the ground... but seems like they are working on culling archaic laws, simplifying procedures and making things easy. That is the work of the ministries. His job is that of a salesperson, telling the world that hey... we are reducing the red-tape, come on in... we are open for business.

c) nothing to add on increasing research. dont think they have done much here... academic wise or in terms of industrial research. latter maybe somewhat through make in India. this is a long-term project, but one that maybe needs time and an early start/policy as well.

d) tax system is the job of the FM. And seems like Jaitley is working on the GST and etc. I can't say I understand everything about it, but prima facie seemed like the right thing to do. 

e) accountability needs to improve for sure, but this seems a bit vague...  

f) education is a key pillar. Ms. Irani has been in the news for the wrong reasons... not all entirely her fault. I think this is a state subject, but yes, need to create more education institutions such as the AIIMS (actually name it something else, create a second-rung, don't dilute the brand of the AIIMS), IITs and IIMs (same, don't dilute existing brand).

190,"&gt;Wut? The commenter above you was saying how BJP supporters connect everything good to NDA govt while everything bad is attributed to congress.

You are commenting with half facts. The commenter said it in response to the OP saying,

&gt;&gt;There is a delay between the time when economic policies are implemented and when they come to fruit. The high 9% growth in early UPA years, IMO, was due to NDA's regime economic policies. Similarly the current government's results will show up in its third-fourth year in office. So the current growth rate is largely due to UPA, though it might have a little upward nudge due to Modi.

/u/lionsupremacist was very clear. He first explains the lag concept in economics, then specifically says that the spike in the early years of UPA could be attributed to the ABVP regimes good work. He even says that this current spike is largely due to the UPA with a little that could be attributed to Modi II.

The user then made a generalisation that while made for a good one liner was flat out wrong. The OP (/u/lionsupremacist) never once said everything good was BJP, everything bad was UPA.

&gt;Pray tell me, would you attribute the current rise in GDP growth(which actually started in 2013) to the UPA-2 govt.

Of course yes. Only somebody very politically partisan or ignorant of economics would say that a regime could affect growth in a year. Sure, the whole 'feel good' factor might have contributed a little, but the current growth is largely attributed to the UPA. 

This govt has only now pumped in $ 70 Bn in infra, pushing towards ease of business etc, the effects of these significant moves would manifest itself only sometime mid 2016ish. Same with their planned labour reforms, though this would have almost instantaneous effects as there is no lag here.

&gt;Signature moves. What do you think is this? WWE.

Every major regime / leader has his / her own way of dealing with economics. Thatcherism, Nixonism etc, in India JN had his own signature way which was a command driven economic model. PVN stood for cutting red tape raj, ABVP was about infrastructure driven growth...if you are picking on a word and twisting the argument, it is lame and semantical at best.

Ok, forget ""signature"" move. Since it irks you so, please could you tell me the top 3 legislative reforms passed by the UPA that aided this ""growth""?

You still haven't answered my question btw.

Your own link (which has been oft linked and debunked) proves my point,

&gt;&gt;It is not that UPA lacked a vision for transforming the institutional framework of the country. It
passed ambitious legislation aimed at increasing transparency in government and providing justice to
citizens. The Right to Information, Forest Rights, Land Acquisition, Lokpal, Right to Education and
National Rural Employment Guarantee Acts

All of it baring MNREGA are social. PLand Acquisition as a ""reform"" is debatable given the horrible bill, but even then it came only in late 2013 and after 9 years of UPA era. The rest are all social bills. Pray tell me how does RTI, RTE, Lokpal etc aid GDP growth?

Look at the first table, this study casually mentions inflation. 11% food inflation is off the walls insane, esp in a deflationary situation as India has been in since 2011.

Look at Fiscal Deficit. Nuff said.

&gt;Roughly a third of GDP has gone towards capital formation under UPA. The corresponding figure
during the NDA years was only a quarter. Similarly, gross fixed capital formation in the private sector
was nearly constant at around 17% of GDP in the NDA years, but quickly crossed 23% once UPA
came to power

Sure, and yet the UPA built lesser roads and rails in 10 years than the NDA in 5. Nice metric, but on ground execution is what makes the difference. Even the flagship MNRega had a near 60% leakage rate which is just mindboggling. This paper will conveniently say ""but Mnrega"" conveniently skipping the fact that MNREGA barely even reached its beneficiaries. 

Annnd the next para says it all,

&gt;&gt;Infrastructural investment even as a fraction of GDP (let alone absolute value) has been substantially
higher during the UPA régime, hovering in the range of 7-8% in recent years as opposed to the 5% or
so that was invested annually by NDA. The graph (figure 8) also shows a rising trend, i.e., over time,
a greater fraction of national income is being poured into power generation, building of roads and
railways, extraction of minerals and expansion of telecom networks. If the targets of the 12th Plan are
met, infrastructure investment will cross 10% of GDP.9

This only tells us the monumental corruption and inefficiency. For instance this paper would consider ""railway projects"" based on funds allocated. But hey, 90% of all projects announced in various railways budgets never even crossed the planning stage. Talk about ""investment in infrastructure"" eh.

One thing this study does not talk about...Jobs. Where are the jobs this fabulous growth got? 2.7 Mn during the high growth UPA I as compared to 60 Mn in the NDA era. The UPA managed to generate another 13 Mn new jobs in UPA II, so combined they still did not create even 1/4th the new jobs NDA created. 

That is why the UPA era is called the era of jobless growth.

Agricultural Growth - Again, the same point. Growth just happened, as not one structural reform to aid agriculture was passed by the UPA I or II.

Subsidy schemes, MNREGA I agree, good scheme, but with 60% leakage...not so good. If leakages can be fixed (As they are now hopefully) it is a much needed scheme.

My point is simple the UPA era had ""growth"" but it was happenstance and thanks to the global scenario. They passed no enabling legislation that bumped up growth, they fucked up infra addition, increased fiscal deficit and doubled inflation and were clueless about controlling inflation btw.",2015-05-30 13:52:25

In fact Jaitley tried to do that by introducing the National Debt management authority, overruling RBI's power to oversee the govt debt. And then Modi perhaps or wider cabinet decided against a separate agency of debt management and the power is still with RBI. 

This is what I am trying to say. They are autonomous and not govt dictated, but if govt wants, it can amend the laws and bring them under complete control. Like what Shinzo Abe did with Japanese Central Bank.

So cute.

Now, you might ask why I consider that comment to biased. I consider it biased because under the garb of being bipartisan, he subtly tried to undermine UPA while nudging Modi's effect into the discussion.

&gt;Of course yes. Only somebody very politically partisan or ignorant of economics would say that a regime could affect growth in a year. Sure, the whole 'feel good' factor might have contributed a little, but the current growth is largely attributed to the UPA.

I am glad you acknowledge it. But, you should also realize that lag does not go into decades. The current govt. has already presented two budgets. It's about time we started giving them credit for whatever happens to the economy.    

&gt;Every major regime / leader has his / her own way of dealing with economics. Thatcherism, Nixonism etc, in India JN had his own signature way which was a command driven economic model. PVN stood for cutting red tape raj, ABVP was about infrastructure driven growth...if you are picking on a word and twisting the argument, it is lame and semantical at best.

You still haven't answered my question btw.

I have answered you. You conveniently chose to ignore the image which showed the drastic increase in FDI. It happened due to revisions in the FDI policy which allowed 100% foreign equity ownership in infra and housing projects.

&gt;Your own link (which has been oft linked and debunked) proves my point

How is posting twisted and irrelevant details debunking?

&gt;All of it baring MNREGA are social. PLand Acquisition as a ""reform"" is debatable given the horrible bill, but even then it came only in late 2013 and after 9 years of UPA era. The rest are all social bills. Pray tell me how does RTI, RTE, Lokpal etc aid GDP growth?

&gt;Look at the first table, this study casually mentions inflation. 11% food inflation is off the walls insane, esp in a deflationary situation as India has been in since 2011.

&gt;Look at Fiscal Deficit. Nuff said.

Again posting irrelevant points to current discussion. I never claimed that there wasn't inflation during UPA-2 nor did I claim that RTE or RTI add to GDP growth. UPA always had high inflation but in UPA-1 it managed to offset by high growth while it failed in it's second stint.  

&gt;Sure, and yet the UPA built lesser roads and rails in 10 years than the NDA in 5. Nice metric, but on ground execution is what makes the difference. Even the flagship MNRega had a near 60% leakage rate which is just mindboggling. This paper will conveniently say ""but Mnrega"" conveniently skipping the fact that MNREGA barely even reached its beneficiaries.

You are probably just including National highways and conveniently excluding the local roads that have been built on a large scale under schemes like MNREGA. If you are including those roads then please share the source of this claim. Also, inspite of the leakages in MNREGA, it has proven to be a decent safety net for millions of rural families. With better tracking and distribution methodologies like aadhar and JDY, it is only going to get better. 

&gt;This only tells us the monumental corruption and inefficiency. For instance this paper would consider ""railway projects"" based on funds allocated. But hey, 90% of all projects announced in various railways budgets never even crossed the planning stage. Talk about ""investment in infrastructure"" eh.

The thing about railways is that it is subject to a lot of constraints about which a govt. at the centre can do little about. I would wait for the performance of modi's govt. before passing judgments.  

&gt;One thing this study does not talk about...Jobs. Where are the jobs this fabulous growth got? 2.7 Mn during the high growth UPA I as compared to 60 Mn in the NDA era. The UPA managed to generate another 13 Mn new jobs in UPA II, so combined they still did not create even 1/4th the new jobs NDA created.

&gt;That is why the UPA era is called the era of jobless growth.

You keep on harping on to this notion yet you don't realize that the 60 million that you counting during ABV regime are simply self-employed ones which effectively means that most of them were left to find livelihood for themselves. In most cases, being self-employed is not as fancy as it sounds. It happens because most of them have no other option. When UPA came, most of them gladly shifted to work in MNREGA. It's as simple as that. Rather than a failure of UPA, it actually shows how UPA was able to envision a safety net for a vast majority of population. 

&gt;Agricultural Growth - Again, the same point. Growth just happened, as not one structural reform to aid agriculture was passed by the UPA I or II.
 
What sort of structural reforms are you talking about. Any drastic changes are difficult to come about in agriculture. Still, UPA managed growth in that sector . You should read the relevant articles of june 2014 edition of yojana to get a better idea :)

Buddy, you are just making sweeping judgments which suit your agenda. Btw, initial set of measures to combat inflation were taken during UPA-2. Also, you might even not acknowledge the drastic growth in FDI and PPP projects. You might also come up with points to suit your theory. The truth is that there isn't going to be much change on broad policies when it comes to macro-economy. You can keep on barking.....I have no intention to reciprocate. Ciao.

212,"&gt; Pre 1992, media used to be quite vocal about minority appeasement. Then they realised, post Babri Masjid demolition, that there is a party that is willing to capitalise on those arguments

So let's put our heads in the sand and allow the government to appease a certain religion and practice divide and rule. It's not like *that* has ever caused religious strife in this country's (or any other's) history. *That's* a very healthy way to conduct discussions on religious harmony, by ignoring one side entirely. 

No, the truth is less important than ensuring that one specific party shouldn't get mileage. In pursuit of that objective, it is acceptable to allow parties such as the Congress and SP to appropriate the ""secular"" label, it's not like those have ever been guilty of promoting religious strife or abolishing civil liberties. It's not like the Hindus have ever been the victims of religious violence in this country, which is why it's okay to propose bills that assume the same. 

So let's just ignore all that and yell that it's a fault of ""Modi's India"" when a Muslim gets denied a job in a private company that Modi neither owns nor has a share in. Let's agree to forget the fact that it has never been a sign of ""Gandhi's India"" when govts were reserving certain jobs for Muslims. Let's celebrate and defend conversions to Islam/Christianity as a manifestation of people's religious rights (which they indeed are, no sarcasm) while wringing our hands on how conversion to Hinduism [literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgnxlpSQgqg) destroys the ""secular fabric"" of this country.

But 'spreading hatred against Modi' was mentioned as a factor in the letter, and that should be condemned as much as TOIlet's shitty journalism, although I would be a fool to think that would ever happen on this subreddit. This was one part of their defense: 

&gt;It has been alleged that we have spread hatred against the Modi government and a copy of our pamphlet on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti was enclosed. We do not see any merit in such a statement. We stand by our opinions. Yes, we were very critical of the government. However, we do not understand how dissent and criticism of the government’s policy is akin to “spreading hatred”. If any person professing an anti-establishment view is accused of engaging in “controversial” activities and all dissent is stifled, wouldn’t that be a violation of our constitutionally guaranteed rights to freely express ourselves? We feel that a vibrant and proactive civil society is an integral part of a healthy democracy. IITM itself have had many meetings that discussed the policies and legislation’s of the current and previous elected governments. Among them the reservation policy is the one which has not been still implemented in IITM campus. Here we want to raise a rational question on IITM’s stand on the reservation policy which is still an alive Government policy even in Modi Government since Independence. When OBC reservation was announced by then Govt., whether anti-reservation student group of IITM simply sat without commending because that its ‘government’s policy’ or it fought against it on the streets of Chennai with its tooth and nail to stop that move? What was the action taken by IITM towards those who fought on streets against the Govt. Policy on Reservation? Rather, the IITM took part in negotiating a raise of 24% to safeguard the vested interested of those anti-reservation body functioning in IITM? ",2015-05-30 20:32:06

229,"&gt; The media was sucking the UPA's dick en masse for the first 6 years or so of their tenure

As many are doing to the BJP now. You're point? Yeah maybe NDTV is still a Congress boot licking bastion, but take a look at everything else.

&gt; There was nothing near the kind of criticism and negative press this government has gotten in just its first year

Lolwut? So much stuff has gone under the radar of the MSM its not even funny, even if it isn't deliberate on their part to ignore potentially controversial stuff about the govt. In terms of negative press, I can name maybe 3 incidents in which the media berated the govt no holds barred, the 10 lakh suit(which they compensated for by covering the auction anyway), the land bill, and now this ""You were ashamed of being Indian"" thing to a slight extent. Apart from that, barely anything. That's ""nothing near the kind of criticism and negative press""? Most of the criticism of the government comes from opposition parties/party spokespersons/party supporters' editorials , interviews, and coverage on debates, and that happened extensively during UPA's first year as well.

Its hard even to compare UPA's first year to NDA's because of the sheer circumstances. In 2004, there was no Arnab Goswami shouting his vocal chords out at your screen, there was barely any online media and media articles that people actually visited regularly like there are today. There was definitely no Indian social media presence to perpetuate and proliferate news as quickly as today. There was TV and newspaper dailies and that's about it. And at the time NDTV dominated the news channels market anyway, I mean some of the popular channels we have today weren't even founded in 2004, so from there obviously there would be positive coverage. There's of course Doordarshan, the perennially alternating dick sucker, so no complaints on that front. 

&gt; Media personalities were collecting bribes from, writing scripted articles for UPA politicians and even holding negotiations between them and industrialists ala Radiagate!

It took a while for Radiagate to come out so I wouldn't too surprised if something similar eventually pops up. In the meantime, there are already suspicions: 

http://indiasamvad.co.in/modis-obsession-with-media-in-day-he-refuses-to-meet-reporters-at-night-he-dines-with-their-owners/

&gt; BJP is a rank amateur

Oh poor them, they should be given some leg room to influence at least a little bit of the media, all this Congress domination is unfair. That doesn't even make sense, even if Congress is more experienced in influencing the MSM (I assume they would be considering they've been in power a lot longer), what gives BJP the right to further degrade the standards of the media by roping in their own stooges? 

&gt; That's why they're on the backfoot now

BACKFOOT?! What backfoot?! '77% say Modi great', 'Industrialists praise Modi', 'Its morning in India', 'Rockstar PM', 'Burre Din khatam, Acche Din aagaye!', 'Best year ever', 'Most reforms in histroy'!!!!! Unless you've been spending most of you're time on the AAP Facebook group or some dejected little corner of internet where all the Congress supporters disappeared to, govt seems pretty much on the front foot according to the MSM. 

Again, opposition will always criticize and that kind of thing happened extensively during UPA too.  A simple google search uncovers enough:

This exactly how the Sangh works. Constant propoganda. Every two days OP comes up with such a shit post to divert attention away from the failings of the central govt.  

This propoganda is also essential for fooling the middle class. People like OP spend day and night trying to paint BJP as a party of development and forward looking politics, and to distinguish them from people like Mulayam, Lalu and Mamta. When in fact, reality is that BJP is exactly like Mulayam Lalu and Mamta. They constantly play caste based votebank politics. They are just a bunch of thugs like Lalu, Mulayam and Mamta but with a dedicated online army willing to spend their entire live defending the shit BJP does. 

Another insight- The same Manjhi BJP supporters used to insult day in day out for playing caste based politics, has now met Dear Leader and is about to join BJP. Why? Mahadalit votebank. But when dear leader plays caste based politics, it's not caste based politics. It's development.

The infamous criminal Papu Yadav is next in line to join BJP. But don't worry, NamoArmy will justify that too.

According to the report, the cost of this “undue benefit” was Rs 3,367 crore, however in a draft report that had been released by the CAG in August 2014, the figure for the undue benefit was Rs 22,842 crore.

TEHELKA: They had control?

Bajrangi: They were very much in control all over the city, all over Gujarat… [But] for two days, Narendrabhai was in control… from the third day… a lot of pressure came from the top… Sonia-wonia and all came here…

Bajrangi: If Narendrabhai comes to meet me, he’ll be in deep trouble… I didn’t expect to see him… Even today, I don’t expect it…

TEHELKA: Did he ever talk to you over the phone?

Bajrangi: That way I do get to speak to him… but not just like that… The whole world starts singing…

TEHELKA: But when you were absconding, then he…..

Bajrangi: Hmm… I did speak to him twice or thrice…

TEHELKA: He’d encourage you…

Bajrangi: Marad aadmi hai [he’s a real man], Narendrabhai… If he were to tell me to tie a bomb to myself and jump... it wouldn’t take even a second… I could sling a bomb around me and jump wherever I was asked to… for Hindus…

SEPTEMBER 1, 2007

TEHELKA: Did Narendrabhai come to Patiya the day of the massacre?

Bajrangi: Narendrabhai came to Patiya… He could not make it to the place of the incidents because there were commando-phamandos with him… But he came to Patiya, saw our enthusiasm and went away… He left behind a really good atmosphere…

TEHELKA: Said you were all blessed…

Bajrangi: Narendrabhai had come to see that things didn’t stop the next day… He went all around Ahmedabad, to all the places where the miyas [Muslims] were, to the Hindu areas… told people they’d done well and should do more…

• • •

Bajrangi: [After the massacre] the commissioner issued orders [against me]… I was told to leave my home… I ran away… Narendrabhai kept me at… the Gujarat Bhavan at Mount Abu for fourand- a-half months… After that, [I did] whatever Narendrabhai told me to… Nobody can do what Narendrabhai has done in - Gujarat… If I did not have the support of Narendrabhai, we would not have been able to avenge [Godhra]… [After it was over,] Narendrabhai was happy, the people were happy, we were happy… I went to jail and came back… and returned to the life I’d led before.

• • •

Bajrangi: Narendrabhai got me out of jail…… He kept on changing judges…. He set it up so as to ensure my release, otherwise I wouldn’t have been out yet... The first judge was one Dholakiaji... He said Babu Bajrangi should be hanged — not once, but four-five times, and he flung the file aside... Then came another who stopped just short of saying I should be hanged… Then there was a third one… By then, four-and-a-half months had elapsed in jail; then Narendrabhai sent me a message... saying he would find a way out... Next he posted a judge named Akshay Mehta… He never even looked at the file or anything…. He just said [bail was] granted… And we were all out... We were free….. For this, I believe in God… We are ready to die for Hindutva...

275,"&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi is determined to move more than 100,000 people living near coalfields in Jharkhand to new homes, making it easier to douse underground fires that have burned for a century and mine huge reserves of premium coal.

Reviving output from country's nationalised coal sector has been one of Modi's most tangible achievements during his first year in office, one that he hopes will secure continuous power to all and eat into an annual coal import bill of $15 billion.

The burning deposits of Jharkhand's Jharia are particularly prized because they are the only source of top quality steelmaking coal in the country. India spends $4 billion a year on importing that grade alone.

RSS has been around forever. Yet, Modi was the first non Congress guy to win absolute majority. The RSS gave it all in the elections because they could smell victory(due to Modi). They probably didn't support Advani(assuming you are correct) because they didn't expect him to win - who did?

394,"&gt;Looks like you are saying that Hindu and FinancialExpress are liars and you do not trust anything from Main Stream Media?

The Hindu article is an Op-Ed.

I trust you know what op-eds are.

The second article does nothing to refute the claim of 2.7 Mn jobs. Lazy effort on your part really (merely Google searching ""UPA Jobless growth not a myth"" and pasting it here is not effort). All it does is take EPFO numbers and jumps to the conclusion that the 1.6% growth figure is wrong.

&gt;It doesn't.

[It does](http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/data_2312/DatabookDec2014%20116.pdf). Though to be fair, the Hindu write up talks about the period 2009-2011, and I haven't seen data for it, and will go by the author.

Both your ""sources"" claim that manufacturing jobs went up and gosh, it is impossible to do 8% growth without a job increase right? Please can you explain [this](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/industrial-production)?

India's [IIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_industrial_production) was ~ 10% in 2006 with no negative growth in the previous 5 year period. IIP averaged ~11% in UPA largely due to the spike in 2006 and 2007 when it touched 20%, compensated ably by a -7% (first in a decade), managed to somehow make itself positive by 2010 and that was it. UPA 2 averaged ~ 4%, but even this does not tell the full story. [Starting Aug 13](http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/data_2312/DatabookDec2014%20134.pdf) all 4 sectors - Manufacturing, Mining, Electricity, General were in the red till May 2014 (the trend continued till Oct 2014). That is 10 months in which the manufacturing, mining, electricity and general industrial sector shrunk, month after month. Here is another fun fact, in the 50 months since Oct 2010, manufacturing has shrunk for 27 months. 

Where is this magical manufacturing growth that absorbed millions upon millions? 

If you weren't so blinded by ideology, you would see that the UPA was an umitigated disaster, but ofc your parochial view set will not allow you to see this. Mind you, as I have said repeatedly, you hate the BJP, Modi, and that is your prerogative, but trying to spin the UPA performance as good is just an impossible dream because aside from a bunch of meaningless op-ed's you won't find any data to support it.

edit - Since your links speak about so much growth, income generation and the land of milk and honey, care to explain [this also](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-2-human-development-index-trends-1980-2013)?

India's HDI value grew by 10% between 2000 and 2005. From 2005 to 2010 it grew by a decent 8%, and...it grew only by 2% during UPA II. The sarkar for the poor, the sarkar for the farmers, the sarkar for the homeless messed up HDI parameters. Even this hides the true story. From 2012 to 2014, HDI grew by a measly 0.2%. 

Want to look at ranks? They tell an easier story. HDI ranking in 2005 was 127. UPA I (the pattern seems very clear, the UPA reaped the benefits of others hard work, and they couldn't sustain this in UPA II and the crows came home to roost) managed to up it to [119](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-11-05/news/28490370_1_capita-income-life-expectancy-human-development-index) in 2010 and then begins the fall and fall and fall. [In 2011](http://asiancorrespondent.com/68673/india-falls-15-places-in-un-human-development-index/) we fell 15 places, down to 134. In 2014 it is at 135. So UPA II managed the amazing feat of reversing a growth trend in HDI that was consistent for 30 odd years. 

Your narrative says there was growth, manufacturing jobs (please explain IIP), increased wages (explain the miserable HDI performance), but data goes against you.

Heck it got so bad that we fell ",2015-06-03 10:31:15

&gt; Arun Jaitely went on to say ""My opposition is based on the ground that post-1973 when the basic structure doctrine was introduced by the Supreme Court, the territory of India is an inherent part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Territory of India is a part of the Constitution. It cannot be reduced or altered by an amendment to the Constitution.""
&gt;
&gt; However, after background briefings by foreign minister in UPA government Salman Khursheed, the BJP leaders saw the merits of LBA and **decided not to oppose it** in the winter session in 2013 thus allowing UPA government to introduce it just before parliament session was called sine die.

There is another [article](http://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/bjp-to-oppose-land-boundary-agreement-with-bangladesh-113120201285_1.html) from that time which talks about BJP's opposition on constitutional and political grounds.

&gt; A senior leader of the party said the BJP would not support any legislation which would lead to a loss of territory for India. The leader added that doing so would be imprudent in an election year, as it **could be interpreted as anti-national**.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We cannot afford to lose an election to ensure that Sheika Hasina's government wins in Bangladesh,"" the leader said.

and

427,"Yes, this is a beginning. But lets get a little more context to see what a massive task this Govt has on its hands as far as overhauling the Railways is concerned.

In 1990, the Chinese Rail Network measured around 57.9K kms while India had  62K route kms. In 2010, we were still at around 64K while China had leapfrogged us to construct a railway network spanning close to 90K. THe speed of the freight train has remained constant at around 24-25 km/h while  in China it was around 80 km/h in 2009.(Source:Economic Survey)

When it comes to hauling freight, Indian Railways is one of the most uncompetitive This is a result of cross subsidising passenger fares through high freight fares. Every time passenger fares are hiked, there is an outcry . Even people who can afford to pay for services (i.e the affluent middle class) whine. 

It will take an enormous amount of political courage &amp; foresight to put the Railways back on track &amp; transform it into a world class service provider. I think in Suresh Prabhu , Modi has the right man for the job. But if the opposition &amp; critics are going to come up with monikers like ""Suit Boot ki sarkar"" every time there is a hint of progressive reform, we will have to be content with ""semi high speed"" trains like these.

482,"&gt;That's called ranking. It's not about fair or unfair. There are several factors which are responsible for your SERP position. Backlinks to your site, Site reputation, etc are some of the factors that determine your SERP.


Here you are talking about impartial search results on google, but its okay if google does this with transparency ? what ? 
I hope you relize how easy it is build a fabricated reputed website these days, so once i have have it i can just post any kind of baseless fact and the results would be on the fist page ? because the source was reputed ? 

Lets take an example, my son wants to do some research on top 10 whatever.. he googles it reads the first 4-6 links takes notes and job well done , thanks to my 'talent' he now has all the right facts he wanted. Good job Google!


&gt;Again I will repeat, Google is not a newsportal. It is searchable index of entire Internet.
&gt;Yeah I know. Like child porn, spammy content, link wheels etc. But they were too technical to mention. 

Really everything ? then why remove the shady stuff ? i'm sure there are plenty of people who would like that. SERP is shit, Google shows what it prefers, face it ! Now the question you should be asking is why ?

&gt;If someone is sharing story of his experience with a corrupt neta, he may not have anything to back his claim. He will not be searchable over Gooogle if your idea is implemented. Then there are some critics, they may lose search attention too. And then there are conspiracy theorists. They can be right or wrong. It's upto me to decide not some Google or some other authority. I will be never able to know someone talking against Syrian govt. 

Understandable, But how are you failing to see that this system is already being misused in every possible way.
Lets look at modi, We all know his history and still he is the PM. Now i would not give a damn if it was someone else like another neta or corporate bots, buts its our PM, this is not acceptable when you put people like him or say obama in such results,  it needs to be given special attention. Thats all. 

&gt;Search Engine's purpose is provide me link of content which have terms I provided in my search keyword. It has got no right to decide what is wrong or what is right for you. There is an entire discussion going on this and here you are, directly asking to not put ""fabricated content"" over Internet. People are questioning Google for showing two different kind of search results for two different countries. Please be careful with your choice, keep in mind repercussions. 

I can see that you advocate free speech and neutrality (online atleast) i do as well, but let me tell you this, one rule does not apply everywhere, i dont advocate right or wrong, i simply choose the lesser of two evils. The days of good and bad are long gone. ",2015-06-05 10:26:51

So buyer is in US and seller is in Romania, why should they pay service tax and TDS in India?


**Indian Govt. want us to pay more taxes than our revenue**, while Ambani &amp; Adanis get freebies.

489,"Copy-pasting the article since it is behind a paywall for some. 

&gt;India is asking Opec members for long-term oil price concessions, its petroleum minister said on Thursday, as it tries to use its growing sway as one of the world’s largest crude importers to lock-in supplies.

&gt;Dharmendra Pradhan told the Financial Times on Thursday he had met with major oil exporting countries in Vienna ahead of Opec’s production meeting on Friday, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Angola and Venezuela.

&gt;Opec’s members have been engaged in a battle for market share after years of fast-growing US shale oil output and other high cost rivals squeezing the cartel.

&gt;“While we value our long-standing relationship with these importers we need to look at our economic interest,” said Mr Pradhan in an interview. “We have to look at who is going to give us the better package — India’s energy requirement will be on an upward path.”
Indian oil demand is expected to rise to 4m barrels a day this year and it is on course to overtake Japan as the world’s third-largest crude consumer in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency.

&gt;India’s pro-business government of Narendra Modi has made moves to try and unlock India’s economic potential since he was elected just over a year ago. Lower oil prices have also given the Reserve Bank of India more freedom to cut interest rates and lowered the country’s stubborn current account deficit.

&gt;Mr Pradhan said he was “hopeful” of securing discounts after the discussions with Opec members at a two-day summit for the oil industry organised by the cartel. When it meets on Friday Opec is widely expected to reaffirm its landmark November decision to keep oil output high to try and hurt higher-cost producers.

&gt;With China’s economic slowdown blunting its energy appetite, India is expected to account for a growing slice of the increase in global oil demand growth the coming years.

&gt;“Everyone is turning to India,” Mr Pradhan said. The fall in oil prices from above $100 a barrel for most of this decade to around $62 today has come as “timely relief” for the Indian economy, he added. Oil and petroleum products already account for 30 per cent of the country’s imports.

&gt;Countries such as India have been traditionally dependent on crude oil from the Middle East to meet their energy needs and have at times paid a small premium compared to buyers in Europe or the US. Around 85 per cent of India’s oil imports come from Opec nations.
Mr Pradhan said India, which is one of the world’s largest oil refiners despite limited domestic crude production, is targeting Venezuela and other Latin American suppliers in particular to diversify its crude imports.

&gt;India’s refineries are now capable of taking “any crude from any part of the world”, he said, adding that the country’s procurement strategy had to change accordingly.

&gt;The country’s modern refining fleet does not only supply the domestic market. Companies such as Reliance Industries have exported growing volumes of refined fuels into Europe in recent years, pressuring aging plants in the region that have suffered from lower local demand since the financial crisis.

&gt;Mr Pradhan said India was also looking to buy more oil to build up its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR), which should cover around two weeks worth of imports when it is completed by the end of this year. It has been negotiating with Iraq for cargoes to fill its SPR.
India may also look to take more oil from Iran if western sanctions are lifted on its crude exports as part of a comprehensive nuclear deal. Mr Pradhan said he would wait and see if the nuclear deal can be finalised later this month.

&gt;India has been one of a handful of countries given a waiver by the US to purchase some oil from Iran, which has limited Tehran’s exports to around 1m b/d.",2015-06-05 11:53:31

How is Arvind not playing caste politics here?

He was speaking in **traders**(not baniyas) meet. As anyone can expect, he was asked about policy he would implement if voted to power. He said he is baniya and knows how to do business.

If you are north Indian(I hate saying North/South, but I can do nothing), you must be knowing it is common stereotype to link Baniyas with Business. We even joke about it. At least I have done. This stereotype comes from the fact that in the past and even in the present they are closely associated with trading and business. Keeping in mind this, it is very important.

Coming back to Arvind,  look at the video where he is saying this, he is not making a serious statement, in a light way he brings in this stereotype and says, ""I am baniya, I know dhanda(business) very well *people in audience and he himself are laughing* ""  .  Then he talks about how he will make sure there is less interference of govt in business and trading.

I fail to understand how is it caste politics. Is Modi saying I am Gujarati, business runs in my blood in Japan. Or saying I am Ahmedabadi when questioned about Gujarat tourism ads in a TV interview, is also regional politics? pro-Region, anti-Indian ? I am not a Modi supporter but I never took it as ""wooing"" Gujaratis. Same is the case here, why to forget about context. ",2015-06-05 12:59:00

Congress won all these years for silly reasons. They lost for a real reason, emergency - even though that was the time when the country finally started working efficiently for the first time.

They lost again after religious fervor rose pre and post Babri Masjid. The government did a good job, apart from dictats and random kulcha stuff similar to what is happening now. That govt lost. Doing a good job is no guarantee of power. Neither is doing a bad job.

UPA II lost. Modi won. Modi may do a good job and lose. That also says nothing. 

I can see the sense of irritation rising already. This yoga, beef kulcha stuff is not what he was voted in for. BJP's new voters are getting increasingly pissed, while older voters are happy. Funnily, people like me who have disliked him are not surprised and are still willing to give him a chance while the new voters are deserting. 

And if he loses, that too would say nothing about development, his capability, efficiency etc. It would probably say a lot about chutiyapa that he cannot control in his party, if anything.",2015-06-05 13:34:04

The Congress was unopposed till about 1980 because of lack of a capable opposition. The moment regional parties started emerging, Congress started losing. This process slowly accelerated and we have reached 2015.

Doling out subsidies as a model WITHOUT investments is what we have been doing for 60 years and it has failed miserably. Which is why I raised the topic of HDI. UPA was the most prolifigate govt we have had in our history and yet, we slipped dramatically in HDI rankings.

Point is not good job  / bad job / electoral victories etc, point is, subsidies as a model of governance is a bankrupt model economically.

Yes, we need to be a socialistic state, dole out subsidies to our poorest, but investment in factories, infra and job creation should be our priority.
