0,"AK has lot nuance which many including him thought he had. There is no point charging NarendraModi for corruptions. 

Everyone knows he has nothing else to live for..Accuse him of being communal or Bigot and charge may stick..trying to proven NaMo as a corrupt politician is like trying to prove Gandhi s has honest politicians and true patriots..No glory to be had here..",2015-12-23 10:24:07

Firstly , he is considered too much of a liability..

Secondly, NaMo doesn't keep such old ppl in his cabinet. That's why his cabinet has literally no one over 65",2015-12-24 23:49:40

None of those profiles post self made rant about India being sithole , namo being retarded , idiot , and Congress is bjp - cow .

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed out some New Year homework to senior bureaucrats by handing a group that met him on Thursday three books -- two on climate change authored by him, including one released at COP-21 in Paris recently, and another by Niti Aayog member Bibek Debroy.The PM asked the secretaries to come up with ideas for ""transformative change"" in good governance and other areas with a focus on changing the lives of people.The two books authored by the PM are 'Convenient Action- Continuity for Change' and 'Convenient Action: Gujarat's Response to Climate Change'.

&gt;* The third book written by Bibek Debroy also deals with Gujarat, titled 'Drumbeats to Ringtones - Gujarat's Strategy for Empowering Tribals'.Some of the secretaries, who attended the year-end event at 7 RCR, said they now have a huge task in hand for the next 10-15 days as PM has asked them to come up with ideas for transformative change in areas such as good governance, employment generation, education and health, farmer-centric initiatives, innovative budgeting, accelerated inclusive growth, Swachh Bharat and Ganga rejuvenation and energy efficiency.

&gt;* We will now undertake this exercise to come out with good plans and initiatives in next one week,"" said one of the secretaries present at the high-tea hosted by the PM.Unlike the pre-New Year get-together of last year, only PM spoke at length on Thursday during the 70- minute interaction with the secretaries.

&gt;* ""In course of the interaction, the PM appreciated the work done by the secretaries over the last year and a half.

&gt;* He said the vast expertise of the secretaries in various domains of the governance should now be leveraged to bring about 'breakthroughs, rather than incremental change',"" a PMO statement said.Modi also laid stress on people's participation in governance and empowerment of the common man.

Otherwise I thought Tathagata satpathy sounded like a decent choice. Swamy or Parrikar would be a great strong leaders too.
