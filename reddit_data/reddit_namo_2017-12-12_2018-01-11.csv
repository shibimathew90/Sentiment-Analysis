So true. It was like finally blowing some steam when WhatsApp, newspaper cartoons etc were abuzz with Modi jokes. I'm glad he chose to plaster himself around India on every board and chose to use language and ideas which are unbecoming of the most powerful man in the country. I was afraid his cult is going to grow. It is being carved away already. Keep making jokes guys. ",2017-12-18 15:45:41

But, the harsh reality is Congress has failed to be a serious opposition and this has made the BJP look all the more strong! BJP wave is not going to die before 2019. ",2017-12-28 01:14:38

**No One Respond To My Good Morning Wishes On NaMo App, Narendra Modi Complains To BJP MPs** 

 ______ 
As unusual as it may sound, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is miffed over the
fact that MPs of BJP are not wishing him 'good morning' on NaMo app.

Speaking at the BJP parliamentary party meeting on Thursday the prime minister
said ""I send good morning messages but apart from five or six MPs, no one
responds.""

Modi also reportedly said that often, he sent important messages with his
morning greetings, but these were missed too. Addressing the MPs PM Modi also
urged them to be more active on the NaMo app.

The BJP has total of 333 members in Parliament, 276 in the Lok Sabha, 57 in
the Rajya Sabha.

pmindia.gov.in

The NaMo app which was launched in 2015 allows users to receive messages
directly from the PM and also post their own messages. Available on both
Android and iOS platforms, the it has registered around 100,000 downloads on
android.

The PM other than conveying his message to the public, has in the past used
the app platform to do surveys and collect feedback from people on
demonetisation and GST etc.

Not sure about South America, Africa is full of dictatorships, you'll get killed in Russia and no chance in the middle East. It's not only about India, but the whole world needs to go forward.

That being said, it's sad that the people who mocked Manmohan Singh as being a puppet are the same who doesn't allow it to NaMo. Double standards.

It's controlling our lives, I'm reading about Security these days and Facebook started telling me how Facebook is secure, how I can improve my security on FB. It's highly manipulative. You must have noticed that you see more posts of the bias you subscribe to. If you are Pro-BJP for instance, most likely you will see more posts regarding BJP/NaMo. Normal users like me and you don't realize how much data social media sites collect. I read an article online, a women in Europe asked Tinder to give her personal information that it has collected from FB and she was shocked to see 800 pages long document. Can you imagine, these companies can provide you 1000+ pages long document on your own information(likes, dislikes, interests, location etc). 

See, if you're on the internet you're already giving away information about you. It's up to you if you wish to limit your information to be shared with these big companies. ",2018-01-02 23:11:28
