0,"It is instructive to look at Japan which suffered from the same problems except they are worse in China. Japan had export oriented economy but it was higher margin and they did not get into the same levels of debt that China did (as of 1995 as a percent of GDP).

With Japan the GDP in 1995 was 5.3 Trillion USD. At this time people were still thinking that Japan will take over the world!, the latest figures from 2014 show that Japan had a GDP of 4.9 Trillion USD. So actually Japan boosted their GDP with insane amount of debt, via abenomics and yet failed to sustain that and fell by 8% compared to 1995.

https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:JPN:CHN:KOR&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en

Given the extreme amount of GDP (most construction and pointless SOE activity) that got pulled ahead into current GDP, China will have to take a huge hit to their economy - mild recession over many years or straight up depression for about 4-5 years and recovery. What this means is that China will probably grow about 0.5% like Japan for the next twenty years (ie, if it doesn't shrink).

Japan hit peak working age population in 1995

China hit peak working age population around 2013-4
http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/01/21/chinas-working-population-fell-again-in-2013/

India's working age population will not hit peak until 2030 and then it will slowly decline, which means if Modi gets his reforms right (or alternatively Rahul Gandhi doesn't become PM in the next 20 years), India will actually grow much like China did in the 90s and 2000's. So a growth rate of about 8-10% (which is half of what China grew ~ 15% from 1995 to 2015).

http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9598/index1.html

India current GDP 2.4 Trillion USD (revised new metrics), growth rate 8.5% over twenty years

China current GDP 10.5 Trillion USD, growth rate 0.5% over twenty years

projected india gdp 2035 -- 12.26 Trillion USD

projected china gdp 2035 -- 11.60 Trillion USD

Fuck it, this issue is beyond political  partisanship and the best and the only thing you can do is rhetoric and polemic without actually giving a single fact. It aint surprising though considering your political bias. I mean where the fuck does Modi or BJP come into this issue of net neutrality ? You have plenty of BJP  supporters supporting this idiotic issue too.

From my pov, this is a simple case of urban yuppies proclaiming as the second coming of satan an issue that doesnt affect 99% of the Indian population. It is a case if the same urban yuppies not understanding that there are so many others who dont have the same priorities as them and considering their economic status would like to save money on special packages if they are being offered. It is a case of urban yuppies crying foul on something that they are not forced to do. I mean,  you dont like the airtel package ? DONT FUCKING BUY IT GODDAMNIT. There are others out there who like that and buy that.

&gt;You have the balls? Right your argument in a self post and lets see how people react.

Considering the nauseating circlejerk here, entitled 21 year olds who dont have a fig of an idea about the priorities facing the bulk of the nation, the best they will do is downvote without getting the simple fact, they dont need to buy something they dont like. Some balls to do that right ?

Sonia Gandhi was a political non-entity in the 90s who couldn't pretend to speak in Hindi. BJP/NDA lost the elections because they  didn't target rural areas and NDA-2's  ""India Shining"" was just as desperate an attempt as UPA-2 ""Bharat Nirman"".

And with them doing such a wonderful job of lowering expectations, Rahul's advisors don't have to prove that he's a genius, or even that he has half a brain. they just need to prove that BJP was wrong calling him pea-brained when his brain is actually walnut sized. At which point it's BJP's credibility that'll take a hit, not Rahul Gandhi's.

This support is leaving aap and getting behind congress now. bjp only has 33% of vote share, if congress could make strong alliances like in 2004 remaining votes will stand behind congress. The problem with bjp is they have higher caste votes but they are only 33% of Indian population ( sc,st,obc make 70% of Indian population) so they either need dalits or Muslims , this is the reason suddenly bjp and RSS are celebrating Ambedkar jayanti and suddenly are pro dalits .

Nor are they, it's called ""Economics and Political weekly"" and not really meant for study purposes although most, if not all of their subscribers subscribe for academic purposes. Heavy Marxist bias and they keep beating the dead horse of BJP = Semi Fascism + evil neo liberalism with occasional quality piece on political or economical analysis with data. 

As for Mihir Sharma, I know about him. Despite his ant-Modi bias, I'd say his anger at economic regulations and policies of India is merited. 

&gt; Where did India go wrong? Mr Sharma picks the leftward lurch in 1969—when Indira Gandhi nationalised banks to outflank opponents in her own party—as a moment when things shifted. Manmohan Singh’s famed budget of July 1991 was badly flawed because the reforms it contained were incomplete. Mr Singh opened up goods markets to competition but did nothing to free markets for land, labour and capital. A ban on selling farmland to industry remains; labour inspectors can still prey on factory owners; and without a bankruptcy law, capital stays trapped in dying firms.

21,"Not a silly question, and no serious answer. In my opinion these questions are important because such topics are never covered in education and seem a bit out of reach to the average person. 

So, the govt. works very similar to any other organization. It has departments, and each department works like an independent company with a bank account or several bank accounts, and is headed by some CEO or secretary or something who would be the signatory, possibly along with some other officials. The dept. will have it's own people and procedures to do purchases. The process includes looking at requirements, options available, tending or rfps etc. There is really no bargaining - the best price is assumed achieved through rfq's.

An agreement is signed with the seller, and bank transfers are made to the sellers accounts usually in parts linked to milestones.

Also, there usually is some dealings with the babu's where negotiations may take place, but that's more about kickbacks or something. Usually done in 5 star hotels. This will never get reported in the news.

Make no mistake, if Modi does not reform the agricultural sector, does not generate 7-8 mn new jobs by 2018 on, keep inflation under check, HE IS going to be voted out, and Pappu is going to be PM.

 let me give you a brief history of Assam;

Assam was an uninhabited land filled with lush green rain forest, till Ahoms made Assam into a habitable heaven. They built an empire that lasted 600 years, kept the Mughals from conquering and British from establishing a strong hold till the Burmese invasion.  And unlike 'rajputs' who sold their wives and daughter to the Mughals just so they can rule their good for nothing deserted lands, us Assamese preferred to chop the heads of our enemies. And we still do!

We stood up to the Chinese, while the rest of India showed it's cowardliness and ran back to Calcutta.

 And we still are your first and best bet at stopping a Chinese invasion before the 'Selfie Queens in Delhi' get their make-up smudged.

And as for Bangladeshis; the central govt. both the current and former ruling parties lied about how they will build a fence at Assam - Bangladesh border, or how the will improve border patrol. All for votes...... .................................           Modi Ji has yet to fulfill his promise he made to Assam:- ""I will rid Assam of Bangladeshis"".

&gt;Not much time left before we start hacking the Bangladeshis to pieces , I can guarantee you that!

Let us see - the justification for Airtel Zero or Internet.org is that people without the access to internet (cause they cannot afford to pay for it) - will be provided with free access to very limited portion of the internet. Something is better than nothing. Very Noble indeed.

Think of Airtel Zero and Internet.org as schemes like cast based reservation in India. Reservation was a noble cause when it was introduced. But look who is paying for it today. Today you could get admission into an IIT if you had less than 50% of the cutoff marks required by a general category student, if you are either from SC or ST. Nothing is free in life. Someone is paying for it. And you want to trust our legislature to pass the right laws and our government to enforce it? Best of luck with that! In a state like TN - 69% of the seats in education is reserved. If it was not for our courts - we would have seen 80% and above.

So tomorrow what is stopping Modi from making the ""Zero"" packet mandatory on all networks? (Disclaimer: I do not lean towards or against any political party). That would make a great speech for the next election ... ""Congress Promised you nothing, AAP promised you free WiFi... and look what I have given you? Free Internet!!!!"". What guarantee do you have that this will not be stretched into votebank politics.

As I said earlier - nothing is free. Some one has to pay for it. A government - does not matter if it is socialist, communist, or capitalist - there is only a few sources to fund them. There is no money tree in the finance ministers yard, nor can you print currency when you like. The government has to either collect taxes, take a loan, make an investment and wait for returns, sell/rent assets. Collecting taxes being the consistent way to fund the Government. So then who pays taxes? Usually the urban population, who cannot take advantage of these reservations. Hence the outrage usually coming from the urban population against reservation.

One thing you need to understand is that Flipkart and Facebook are advertising/marketing platforms. They themselves do not sell anything. So when Flipkart becomes part of the Airtel Zero pack and Facebook becomes part of Internet.org pack - what are they in effect doing? They are paying for the free very limited internet connection that these people could not afford in the first place. So what is wrong - they are the ones paying ... remember there is nothing free. In effect what they are doing is - they are paying for additional few million hits on their pages. They will use these figures to go back to the people who are selling products on their platform - for example HP (almost 30% of their sales happens online) and tells them - ""we need an additional 3% for listing your product! Look at the number of visitors we have..."". So not wanting to take a hit on their sales - they increase the price of their products by 5% and pay 3% to the platform owners. And guess who buys their products ...??? I am sure people who cannot afford an Internet pack cannot buy a laptop. It is the people who pay and use for the internet - that end up paying the difference!

You can be my guest and pay for my Buffet, but please do not ask me to eat the ""free"" porridge - cause in the name of making it free it has been stripped down... and what is being offered is just boiled water.",2015-04-28 01:55:40

AAP as a party could never be successful in bringing about a change in Indian politics because AAP believed in honest individuals (and thereby a honest party) leading change. This does not happen in society as explained by JP Narayan, the founder of Lok Satta Party. Only way to bring about change is by building institutions - creating system of incentives that promote good clean politics, continuously pushing small incremental change without resorting to a 'revolution' by self proclaimed moral saints. AAP is not different than any other party in India. It has the potential of becoming far more disastrous than other political parties. Modi on the other hand has a reputation as an institution builder. It can be seen through his actions on going forward with Finance Commission's revenue sharing formula (instead of Centre's discretion) as well as a competitive mechanism for smart cities. On every forum he has underlined his push for policy driven state, where a set of rules determine policy and not the whims and ideologies of politicians or bureaucrats. Sound, accountable institutions are responsible for drafting these set of rules. 

This is a video of JP Narayan's discussion at IIMK where he explains why 'moral' parties, 'moral' individuals (AAP approach) or passing humane laws (Right to Education, Right to Food, Employment Guarantee - Congress approach) cannot bring about change in any significant measure. Only way to do it is to build sound institutions.

Nirmala sitharman is not hounded because she is not in the crosshairs. Why would someone sushma swaraj for that reason. Modi gave her a ministry on some trust dont you think. 

&gt;why should women like each other just because they are both women?

No need to like each other. But do not deride each other. Smriti irani found camera in changing room and most AAP female supporters and madhu kishwar made fun of her. Way to go empowerment.

Dont spin it around to equality, Men are doing something wrong but to get out of patriachy woman should be taking care of what they say about other woman and applaud their efforts. 


Feminism should not only be about finding faults in society, its also about introspect and finding faults within yourself and fix them. 

As for a mans view

najma heptulla- Some men hate her for being a muslim in BJP not because she is woman.

smriti irani - Her qualifications are not for HRD, which by logic means last 60 years we had all wrong people in various ministry. Next time elect electrical engg for Power ministry. 

Sushma Swaraj- Wonderful orator, but some woman call her advanis agent! BJP fan boys right wingers and modi fans all respect her while haters are liberals. 

Sonia Gandhi- No one hates her for being a woman,  we hate her for being gandhi, italian agent etc. People who use waitress as a term should be sued and asked to produce evidence in court. Sonia Gandhi being an educated powerful woman should do it. What stops her?

147,"&gt;That doesn't stop the BJP being a regressive and religious supremacist party.

That like I said is your opinion and one you are entitled to just as I am mine. If one looks at electoral trends (increasing numbers of minorities voting in incumbent BJP state govts), clearly your opinion seems to have less merit, but on this we will have to agree to disagree as our positions are pretty intractable I guess.

&gt;That's why democracy works and ""meritocratic"" government like China does not (on average).

I would disagree - China has worked and worked spectacularly. Arguably the only modern, major economic power that has gotten there WITHOUT either the benefits of external colonisation (Europe) or internal colonisation (USA). You do have other such cases, Germany comes to mind, as does Japan but these are imo the outliers and Germany / Japan did not have the same problems China did and still does.

Even the US in its early days was ruthlessly meritocratic, and not till about 1900 (and the vested interests of the robber barons came to the fore) did it start to become a society run by vested interests. France went through this phase as well. 

I can't believe you are arguing for dynasty over meritocracy.

&gt;No representation, no power. Simple as that.

If one goes by my oft repeated example of minorities voting for the BJP repeatedly and in increasing numbers, clearly they are not seemingly deprived of power. You look at Sachar and it says that the Gujarati Muslim fares much better than the average Indian Muslim in terms of income. Gujarat has the highest number of Cat A Muslim bureaucrats etc etc. As long as policies are not discretion driven but rule driven (a big credo of Modi and to a smaller extent CM's like Parikkar or Chouhan) no reason why this should continue to be the case.

&gt;Yes, minorities are not fair to them. There's so much bad blood by now that the BJP struggles to attract them in big numbers. 

It quite literally is not whataboutism. It is a real concern. BJP stands Minority candidates, they lose (they lose both the Hindu vote as well as the minority vote who anyways detest the BJP and won't ever vote for them). This is a two way street and as long as the media keeps drumming up the ""But Idea of India is under ze attacks"" and morons (I respect him for the job he did as an IPS professional btw) like Ribiero feed the propoganda, the minorities won't ever trust the BJP in non BJP ruled states.

Sorry mate, you can't just say ""my father spoke to xyz about interest rates"". Interest rates are governed by the RBI and a 2% increase in interest rates would have had spectacular media attention.

&gt;Gujarat's agricultural transformation is commendable but know that gujarat was a bottom dweller in agriculture . He completed narmada dam and other projects and developed a extensive canal system . He also ensured stable power supply to agriculture cutting down theft . Guajrat's transformation is not a result of mechanization or research or high yeilds . Its simply due to vast amount of land newly irrigated .

UP is a bottom dweller, why isn't it making strides? MP was a bottom dweller making spectacular strides. And...obligatory HOLY SHIT. This is like saying,""Israel's performance in agriculture is bs as it is only because of irrigation"".

Subsequently, after the submission of the KRC report in 2000, the Group of Ministers (GoM) directed a task force led by Arun Singh to analyse the functioning of the higher defence organisation and suggest measures for its improvement. Among the major recommendations of this task force, subsequently accepted by the GOI, was the creation of the post of the CDS supported by a tri-Services joint planning staff. While the latter in the form of was created the Integrated Defence Staff, nothing came about of the establishment of the CDS. However, **the then government must be commended for implementing other recommendations of the KRC and GoM reports regarding accretions to our defence set-up, namely the Defence Intelligence Agency and the NTRO.**

&gt;A Group of Ministers (GoM) Committee, chaired by then-**Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, was then constituted to study the need to reform India’s national security system.** The committee in its report recommended a “comprehensive systemic overhaul of the country’s security and intelligence apparatus” and identified that:

&gt;The system governing defense acquisitions suffered from a lack of integrated planning, weaknesses in linkages between plans and budgets, cumbersome administrative, technical and financial evaluation procedures, and an absence of a dedicated, professionally equipped procurement structure within the MoD.

&gt;No congruence existed between India’s national security objectives, its defense objectives, defense policy and directives for the Defense Minister.

&gt;The defense planning process was greatly handicapped by the absence of a national security doctrine and commitment of funds beyond the financial year. It also suffered from a lack of inter-service prioritization and flexibility.

&gt;There was dysfunction between technology planning and development and coordination between R&amp;D (e.g., DRDO), production agencies (e.g., HAL) and users (e.g. IAF).

&gt;Peace means defeat in the Pakistani scheme of things. Every India-Pakistan negotiation that ends up ceding some ground to our western neighbour will, in fact, embolden it to seek even more. The matter will never end till the Pakistanis themselves abandon the ideology of a religion-based state (especially a religion-based state that is also setting itself up in opposition to the idea of India.) But that realisation is some decades away.  ",2015-04-29 20:14:27

I clearly stated that AAP supporters (and not me!) consider their party a ""*a party with a difference*"". In their words they are here to do honest politics. So the Whataboutism shown in every thread is retarded to say the least. Accept that you are here to play politics like everyone else and people will take you more seriously. The holier than thou attitude on display is nauseating. 

&gt;So as long as AAP is better than other parties, that's enough.

And yet you seldom state what makes AAP better than other party. Almost all your comments are ""*But BJP does it too!*"". Learn to criticize your own party for a change. It will only make it better,

&gt;Rest of your comment is nonsense.

For someone who goes by the name IndianBureaucrat your knowledge of Polity is pretty naive. And you display it time and again. You talk about Modi asking for TMC support for the GST without realizing that GST requires ratification by at least half the states because it alters the federal structure vis taxes.

The only thing you have is Ashwini Upadhyay and Shri Gadkari's accusation. The complete lack of evidence otoh doesn't get in the way of it being pedestalized to an ""uncomfortable truth"".

&gt;since Coalgate broke the AAP has never raised a single complaint against Naveen Jindal

then how about they're probably unable to get evidence against him? There would be a dozen explanations before one attributed it to malice- from lack of focus to incompetence, but malice it is! And btw, here's something from [after coalgate](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-aap-s-list-of-corrupt-includes-rahul-gandhi-naveen-jindal-1958611)


I too expect the AAP to be my vendetta army and bring past criminals to account, and I'm a little pissed with them in my own way. But I'm not strewing about baseless conspiracy theories that their inaction stems from complicity. What's even more asounding is the fact that people are holding a civil society org accountable for UPAs crimes as if they were the actual perpetrators, and not a word about the callous and incompetent lack of action by the CBI, CVC, the central government or the judiciary.

Here's a food for thought - take your own advise and pressure the Modi government to clamp down on AAP and AK for being a CIA funded Ford Foundation proxies and possible naxalites/Pak agents.

* From December 2012 (after the Guj victory and he being made PM candidate) till Dec 2013 the narrative was, ""he won't be acceptable in the case of a hung parliament"". ""he will never pull votes, and his hardline nature will chase even moderate Hindus away"".

* From Dec 2013 to March 2013, Modi ran a blistering campaign, every rally of his attracted lakhs of people, opinion polls started to indicate a clear NDA victory with maybe a little help from a few outside parties (and not the abject defeat or hung assembly predicted earlier on) and this is when the media just could not dump shit on him as their own credibility (whatever little that is left) was at stake AND eyeballs.

He mentions that one CM of Bihar was a barber caste, and opposition ( which was congress) used to taunt him by saying that he should go and open a barber shop in delhi ( as an casteist insult).

&gt; At the rising mix of stupidity and nationalism with no intelligence/education to temper it. And in India there is a huge population of stupid, uneducated idiots who can be riled up on the most stupid topics. Like eating beef. Or two consenting adults having sex. It is fucking pathetic.

My reaction is same, albeit it also includes the educated elite who put up a pretense of social understanding when they don't understand anything. All the backward shit you mention, these are traits of economically backward nations, could they be correlated? I'll leave the thinking to you. Practices evolve the way they do according to circumstances, until you change said circumstances you. can. not. change. shit. 

Nationalism - India is a young nation, for fuck's sake we were born in 1947 and why were we? nationalism. It served its purpose, too much of it is bad, but we can't suddenly wake up one day and get rid of it. All young nations tend to be nationalistic, check Bangladesh for example.

&gt; - Indian nationalism refers to the many underlying forces that defined the principles of the Indian independence movement

&gt; - The nationalistic sentiments among Congress members led to the movement to be represented in the bodies of government, to have a say in the legislation and administration of India. Congressmen saw themselves as loyalists, but wanted an active role in governing their own country, albeit as part of the Empire. This trend was personified by Dadabhai Naoroji, who went as far as contesting, successfully, an election to the British House of Commons, becoming its first Indian member. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the first Indian nationalist to embrace Swaraj as the destiny of the nation.

Try reading some Indian history.

Intelligence/Education - Population size and growth, lack of public funds to support education of this size. How does it come? With fucking economic growth. I stumble into waaaayyy too much dumb shit around these parts. Intelligence, however, doesn't come by education, it becomes pretty evident if you hand around /r/india, educated upper middle class folks saying utterly stupid shit.

&gt;  And in India there is a huge population of stupid, uneducated idiots who can be riled up on the most stupid topics. Like eating beef.

Or in other parts of the world, and in India, a girl not covering her head, non-halal meat, and pull some old time Christian shit from the west. Religion and economic backwardness also go hand in hand. It's not trivial shit, it's religiously trivial shit, religious beliefs and practices can't be done away with easily. Beef eating is not a trivial issue for the Hindus, it might be for us. Religion itself is bullshit for many of us, including myself, but try telling that to people and they'll lynch you publicly. Progress can't be achieved within a day. 

&gt;  Or two consenting adults having sex. It is fucking pathetic.

I presume you are talking about pre-marital sex, the opposition to this has its roots in archaic time when there weren't any medical means to verify the fatherhood of offspring. It's backward practice, but it becomes a social thing as centuries go by and it evolves, consider the opposition to it a few decades ago and then consider it now, things improve at a snail's pace when critique of backward practices is shut down in the name of religion, that's down to governmental policies.

285,"Here's my viewpoint.

Land is important. We all need it for various purposes - Agriculture, Infrastructure projects, Better Housing,etc. We all agree here.

In India around 60% of the population lives on farming. only 10% own lands but the others are farm laborers (who help the farmer in harvest times, to till land, cleaning after the crop, etc.). These 10% have their lands in and around cities, towns, villages.

Sure, all infrastructure projects can be built on barren lands, in the middle of no where. But who will use it? Farms are around townships, factories should also be around the townships. A smart government would try to balance both. Although I can be blamed for being biased towards Modi, I would say Modi is bang on!

&gt;Vacant plots of land purchased by Industries, with no construction or factory for past 5-6 years (Baddi Zirakpur etc.,)

I agree on this part when it comes to urban areas. There should be some credible activity or the government should take that land back.
And also, unused or illused industrialized area needs to be brought under the scanner. The honest answer to 'why farmland' is because India's farms are mostly in the rural regions and industries/infrastructure is needed in these rural areas which needs land!!

As a side note....

(Also, India is heavily populated. Although a significant section has reduced the fertility rate, another section is no where close. I hate to bring in religion here, but understand the population crisis at hand and keep that in your purview as well. We should also keep in mind we don't run into the problem of aging population.)",2015-05-01 19:49:19

A Catholic priest tried repeatedly to warn the Father about Modis mysterious origins. The priest hints that he may not be human. Modis dad is irritated by the man and rebuffs his persistent intrusions.

Besides Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley - Nitin Gadkari, Venkaiah Naidu, Suresh Prabhu are definitely part of these meetings. Listen to their interviews, whatever they are saying aligns with what the other three (Amit Shah works behind the scenes, no major interviews) are saying. Please see the interviews the chief economist and finance minister are giving abroad. View the discussions going on in American thinktanks about India.

Industrialization and urban planning requires FDI. Make no mistake, **India cannot industrialize without foreign capital or technical know-how**, anyone who suggests that it can, doesn't even have basic knowledge about economics. Every late-comer economy does it this way.

You need these things for FDI:


1. Removal of FDI caps

2. Intellectual property laws 

3. Transportation infrastructure. 

4. Ease of doing business

5. Trained labour 

For the above you need:

1. Land acquisition law [Amit Shah]

2. IPR to accommodate western interests. [Modi will go against swadeshi wing of BJP/RSS to get this done]

3. Simplifying the processes, cleaning up archaic laws. 

4. Devolve powers to states. [This is the biggest reform, already achieved by Modi government]

5. Overhaul of railways, shipping and ports. [Gadkari, Prabhu] 

6. Urbanization where skills training can be provided. [Naidu]

India is gearing up for a 2-3 decade long boom. If you are a trained economist you are see a plan being executed. Arun Shorie seems to be butthurt that he is not privy to these things and being very entrenched in the establishment, views their plan as 'directionless,  'headline management' because work is going on in disparate parts of government. No economist would ever go by headlines and would first look at legal and policy changes going on. These things will have an impact 2-3 years later. Right in time for next general elections.

2. Europe

307,"Arun Shourie is one of the few people I still trust completely. However, I don’t agree with allegations of headlines management. It takes time to negotiate big projects and implement them. With the advent of Twitter and Facebook the government is going to do everything possible to stay in positive news. Newspaper reports nowadays contain tweets showing government announcements and policies. The way politicians communicate with masses has fundamentally changed. 

The opposition has been ineffective in countering government propaganda because its leaders are not ready to accept the new world. The whole Congress revolves around Sonia and Rahul Gandhi but they both don’t even have twitter accounts. If you are not active on social media then efforts taken by you to connect with masses are just promotional events designed for media blitz. People have very short memory and nobody remembers them after two weeks. 

People today want direct interaction with leaders to discuss problems. The way Indian Foreign Ministry responded to people in Yemen and Nepal is the proof people love the new communication tools. The leaders who respond become popular and those who can’t use social media will be pushed to oblivion. 

Headlines management is an essential art of governance to keep the public opinion on your side. Modi government may not be pushing every sector forward but it is clearly doing much more than the previous Congress government.",2015-05-01 22:53:38

310,"Your picture does not consider the nuances enough.
Republics are more pro-R&amp;D than democrats. 
[A larger fraction](http://www.visualnews.com/2012/01/31/republicans-vs-democrats-who-rallies-for-science) of republicans think science has a positive effect on society. In any case, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Q8UvJ1wvk) is Neil DeGrasse Tyson explaining how science funding has been greater under republican administration, specially during Bush administration than under democratic administrations.

The main point of difference between Republicans and Democrats is where the R&amp;D money comes from, not the fact that there needs to be money in science. From the first link, one can see that conservatives think private funding is at least as important as State funding, while liberal democrats think State funding is much more important than private funding.


It is dangerous to have anecdotal and simplistic opinion about anything, most of all the United States. It's not been a superpower for a century for no reason. It is not dumb.

Edit: formatting.

Edit 2: It seems I didn't make it clear that I am completely in agreement with part of OP's conclusion, namely that we need to massively increase R&amp;D spending and take advantage of any budget cuts in USA and elsewhere. Where I differ is that I think OP's diagnosis of the situation is off the mark, and details are important while coming up with a strategy. Looking at R&amp;D situation in the US through the lens of republicans=anti-science, democrats=pro-science is a mistake that might cause us to come up frame a wrong policy (for example, by making false assumptions about their stand on IP or renewable policy)

Most of the anti-science stand of republicans is political rhetoric. Like BJP and Congress, dems and reps oppose some ideas they will support if in power. Climate change may be one of those rare fields among many fields where they will actually cut funds, but even here I am not sure. Majority of republican supporters believe in climate range and support renewables. [source](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/republican-views-on-climate-change). NASA's [Project Orion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)) is on schedule. Their private space market is seriously heating up.

Our investment in R&amp;D is very low, at around 0.8% of GDP. US is at 2.9%, and Israel is close to 4%. China has improved massively, and their figure is now close to 2% [source](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS). Manmohan Singh's stated goal back in '09 or so was to get it up to 2%. Hasn't happened. Let's see what Modi does. In absolute terms, our R&amp;D spending is less than 4% of the US figure, and this doesn't take into account their 'black' projects. 

We need to be realistic, and we need to have long term strategy. Some Indian researchers will definitely start coming back home if we  keep ramping up the R&amp;D spending. China did it.",2015-05-01 23:13:11
311,"&gt; Please see the interviews the chief economist and finance minister are giving abroad. View the discussions going on in American thinktanks about India.

Yes, I do follow Arvind and Raghuram closely, although I will concede that I haven't followed much of outside content on Indian economic policies of land. I do recognize that economic policies take a considerable amount of time to show results, on the other hand I haven't felt a substantial effort in liberalizing Indian economy and I do have some knowledge about legislation in India concerning economy, most of it needs to be junked.

&gt; Industrialization and urban planning requires FDI. Make no mistake, India cannot industrialize without foreign capital or technical know-how, anyone who suggests that it can, doesn't even have basic knowledge about economics. 

That is fair, and yes I know that very well. Not *just* foreign investment, foreign trade in general helps a lot, principle of comparative advantage among other things. Although again, as far as legislation is concerned I haven't seen some drastic measures to make it easier for foreign investors. 

&gt; Intellectual property laws

I disagree on this bit, not entirely the principle of intellectual property laws but bringing them in line with ""international standards"", in some fields I'd rather them be lax, it shouldn't be too high up the list of priorities and they should focus on other things if they can. Yes, the Chinese exploited them but India can make sure that Indians don't while not getting carried away with IP laws. The laws concerning pharma industry are really helpful (generic drug etc).

&gt; Land acquisition law [Amit Shah]

As for this, the need for this arises when they can't trade freely in the market, i.e. prohibition on transfer of ownership of farmland for non-agricultural purposes, why not get rid of those laws and let industrialists buy directly from farmers? I'm asking because I really have no input on this, no preconceived ideological opinion. 

&gt; [Modi will go against swadeshi wing of BJP/RSS to get this done]

I would say that the whole of BJP is against RSS' swadeshi economic ideology, has generally been that way. RSS compensates for it by dictating cultural agenda and specifically education, which I personally don't like.

&gt; Devolve powers to states. [This is the biggest reform, already achieved by Modi government]

It has both ups and down, a reasonable centre administration can keep states dragging along which have a habit of voting in horrible political class, on the other hand states with more competent administrations would flourish and by the laws of market, it would balance the shitty administrations and clean up those states' politics as more and more people will move away for economic opportunities among other things. 

&gt; Overhaul of railways, shipping and ports. [Gadkari, Prabhu]

General infrastructure in India needs a severe reform, I recently read an article in dad's magazine which was arguing for privatization of infrastructure (for profit), although I disagreed with that as infrastructure is one of the very few topics where I tend to be a ""socialist"", it did shed some light on the problems of current structure. If they could shed the extra spending on populist means, especially stuff like metro trains (or monorail) where not necessary and reduce the rampant misuse and wastage of public funds, India could severely benefit from extra spending on public infrastructure. I was surprised to learn that Punjab's infrastructure is among the best as I always considered it to be sub-standard.

&gt; India is gearing up for a 2-3 decade long boom. If you are a trained economist you are see a plan being executed. 

I am an armchair economist, most of my knowledge isn't studied but gathered. I didn't like many of Shourie's arguments but I have been, from last few days, studying public policy and legislation for academic purposes and growing disgruntled by the lack of reforms, they are focusing on political sustainability more, which is all practical and fine but I can't help but feel disappointed. Although as the classical rule goes, everyone works in their self interest so I should be more realistic but I hadn't set my expectations high in the first place, which is why disappointment is surprising. Also, /u/MyselfWalrus has a nice habit of posting links proving that most of what BJP is doing isn't entirely new or reformist, they tend to market things better.

&gt;  No economist would ever go by headlines and would first look at legal and policy changes going on. These things will have an impact 2-3 years later. Right in time for next general elections.

If history has taught us anything, the time taken varies from 4-6 years. Case in point, UPA 1 reaped benefits of NDA's policies. I am not entirely relying on headlines, or not at all for that matter. I strictly follow the core content, there has been good work but nothing substantial.

&gt; 2,3 wont.

Why do you say that? There attention being elsewhere?

&gt;  For India's sake hope Democrats, especially some socialist joker like Bernie Sanders doesn't win.

Haha, I'm in the Rand Paul camp. I was reading the CMV post on Bernie Sanders, that was quite something. I have read a little about Bernie Sanders and whatever I read makes me feel glad even at the prospect of Clinton winning, she's comparatively a benign centrist in American context. America seems hell bent on trying out socialists and taste failure, not learning from rest of the world's experiences. Bush is the one to blame, though, he gave capitalism and markets a bad name.

My mom was nodding her head hearing him talk about the first plastic surgery being Ganesha's head transplant. That's the populace he's aiming for. He may also have his own biases and religious beliefs but think ... if he's confident enough to show it in public, he knows people will support him.

314,"I am bit busy right now, I will try to answer your questions in detail later. But one important thing I can tell you is that, India doesn't need big reforms per se - it needs fix the execution. Also, Modi is an institution builder. More an executive than a legislator. Create a body, put professionals in charge and let them run the show. So the changes that are happening cannot be reported in the news - things like officials show up on time, or deserving official was given charge etc. 

Also, you should check out JP Narayan's lecture at IIMK and his other lectures as well to get an idea of why devolution to the states is the biggest reform. This practically makes India like China. China is not a democracy but on ground level it is far more democrat than India because there is accountability. XYZ is accountable for performance for a province. No buck passing. You perform you get promoted. Same things will happen in India, devolution to states reduces the buck passing... 
Naidu even wants to increase the share of urban areas, so funds not just shared with states, but also local civic bodies. This is a very fundamental change in how government works in India. MSM audience is too naive to understand this, so MSM doesn't talk about it.

On Bernie Sanders, the guy is awesome. For US. Not for us. We need pro corporates in the US - Republicans. Sanders wants to put up all sorts of trade barriers. This is a big risk factor, like Rajan pointed out, if export demand continues to be weak, and Modi 'picks' industries to develop, we could fuck up big time. So Rajan is absolutely right when he says that government investment should stop as soon as private investment gets unclogged and ""Make in India for India"", ie focus on import substitution rather than export driven industrialization.

3. Consolidation of portfolios -

Most countries have 20% of goods moving on water, India has less than one percent. One minister who can monitor port and highway development, since there huge synergies there. 

4. Work on smart city challenge. Designing point system to determine which cities win the smart city funding. Designing policy and regulation instead of doing some backroom deals. 

5. Devolution to states - the smartest and most earnest people in India have been recommending this. Finally it has been done. More devolution is on the cards with civic bodies getting a chuck on share from the centre.

Please see the interviews the chief economist and finance minister are giving abroad. View the discussions going on in American thinktanks about India.

Industrialization and urban planning requires FDI. Make no mistake, **India cannot industrialize without foreign capital or technical know-how**, anyone who suggests that it can, doesn't even have basic knowledge about economics. Every late-comer economy does it this way.

You need these things for FDI:

1. Removal of FDI caps

2. Intellectual property laws 

3. Transportation infrastructure. 

4. Ease of doing business

5. Trained labour 

For the above you need:

1. Land acquisition law [Amit Shah]

2. IPR to accommodate western interests. [Modi will go against swadeshi wing of BJP/RSS to get this done]

3. Simplifying the processes, cleaning up archaic laws. 

4. Devolve powers to states. [This is the biggest reform, already achieved by Modi government]

5. Overhaul of railways, shipping and ports. [Gadkari, Prabhu] 

6. Urbanization where skills training can be provided. [Naidu]

India is gearing up for a 2-3 decade long boom. If you are a trained economist you are see a plan being executed. Arun Shourie is not stupid. He knows that bureaucrats are working overtime to formulate policies and removing senseless regulation from 100 years ago, streamlining processes. He understands the long term implications of what Modi government is doing. Arun Shourie is willfully talking bullshit. I don't know why. I am sorry to say this, right now Arun Shourie is coming off as an butthurt asshole who has been pushed out of the inner circle. No economist would ever go by headlines and would first look at legal and policy changes going on. These things will have an impact right in time for next general elections. 

This a presentation by India's CEA to an audience which is far smarter than fuckwit named Thapar, on what the govt has done so far:

The only saving grace is that there are a few good people in the BJP like Jaitley. And Modi hasn't really personally done anything majorly wrong other than the sin of inaction. It remains to be seen how things will turn out; but right now it's not looking great. On economic and foreign policy there's not really a huge difference between congress and the bjp. I mean look at MMS's budget during PVNR and compare it to jaitley's budget.

In Bengal the BJP allied with Trinamool Congress in the past, who are basically thugs and opportunists. Now that things have changed all of a sudden TMC is everything that is wrong with bengal. All bengalis new then and now what TMC is like. It's just petty politics.

Minority pandering happens all over the world. This isn't some kind of genius revelation that Indian BJP supporters suddenly discovered, nor is it a unique problem. Quibbling over what democracy originally means is moot, this is how democracy works in the real world.

&gt;I agree. But it is only conservative Hindus, whereas muslims mainly vote for party standing in opposition to BJP. 

Again, this is what happens all over the world. African Americans overwhelmingly vote democrat, whereas lots of educated non-fundie caucasians also vote democrat.

If you are part of the majority it's very unlikely that you would see yourself under threat from a 14-15% minority. So you would vote for whatever economic or political policy you see fit.

A minority on the other hand would almost always see themselves as oppressed or discriminated and will vote for whoever promises help.

Is it possible they could attack us? I'd say the chances of China attacking Nepal is as much as India attacking Nepal - very very low. Nepal serves as buffer for the two country and a stable government there is in interest to both countries. If one country attacks Nepal, other country will react not just because of the love for Nepal, but more importantly because of strategical reasons (there is a concern for both countries that the other could influence the separation sentiments of the bordering states (for India) and Tibet (for China). 

I have to say, despite the history with China, Nepal feels closer to India.

&gt;Even if Nepal were to join the Indian union would it be so bad? What are the arguments against it?

For any sovereign nation this would be an utter insult. Nationalism and sovereignty is ingrained in the citizens. Would India be comfortable with Chinese takeover? Also, our understanding is Sikkim didn't turn up great after annexing to India. The realty might be different, but that's our take - how the Sikkim king was sidelined right after the annexation and how indigenous people in that region are not fairly treated by the country.

&gt;How do nepalis view PM Modi's visit to your country last year?

Nepal fell in love with Modi. 95% people still take that as a historic visit in the interest of Nepal. Remaining 5% is cautious, Modi has big aspirations for India - does that necessarily mean bad for Nepal? Maybe, maybe not. As over-sensitive as it may sound, Buddha born in Nepal is a big matter of pride to Nepalis; Modi claimed he was born in India first, then in Nepal he said he was born in Nepal, and immediately after leaving Nepal he is saying he was born in India. This mixed message has confused most at best, and riled a few at worst.

Jesus Christ, I merely said that important people like Shourie can't be the only ones desperate to be in the news. It's not a one way street. Thapar is becoming I irrelevant, much like Shourie. This interview helps him as well as Shourie. Don't imagine things.

&gt; But do think, how does Thapar know that Shourie is ready to criticize the govt in public? You think he sends Shourie a feeler every week?

Because Shourie was ignored by Modi during cabinet formation and ministry allotment? Do you even know the politics behind it in the first place or are you just using recent news reports? Everyone who actually knows about these things knows Shourie was ignored by Modi, ergo Shourie may be annoyed with him.

&gt; Why did only Thapar get the interview and no one else? Beacause Shourie is comfortable with Thapar dealing with such a sensitive issue.

Because Shourie will give such an important interview only to one person instead of going around shouting Bhaiyya interview lelo interview lelo? Common sense hai, difficult nai hai.

&gt; You think he sends Shourie a feeler every week?

I'm neither person's PA, so I have no authority to say about that. I'm asking for sources for the claims you're making. However, it won't be a stretch to think that Shourie, or people like him would get a lot of interview requests due to their importance vis a vis the happenings in the country.

&gt; Bottomline, such interviews are always initiated by the interviewee.

Whataboutism - no one said there were NO bans during the UPA government. But, I don't swear my allegiance to a political party and therefore have no bhakti towards it.  NDA government - from beef bans, to NGO travels, to censorship ban is conservative and regressive. 

&gt; he bhakti that you call is a result of years of UPA I and II's policies that have made india what it is today. So the only hope we see to a better country is what people hang on to.

Yeah? What's stopping the NDA to remove these bans? It's been 1 f**** year for the GREAT Modi-ji government. Lets see a reversal of ALL these bans? NO!

New incidents will come up and the Christian spokesmen will again peddle the “truth” that under Narendra Modi as Prime Minister the Hindus are emboldened to “attack” Christians in hate crimes and that Christians feel helpless and insecure. 

This article was written by someone with little to no knowledge of the ground realities in india. Yes, the church attack issues were hyped beyond necessity but fact remains that blanket statements are very easy to make and hard to prove.

Christians, while not under siege, are increasingly becoming a soft target. I'm sure many outside the metros and the immediate vicinity of the coastal areas had no idea that christians even existed in india. This is a guess, but i'm pretty sure it can be proven.

With the sudden increase in access to information, the conversion issue has come into the limelight. It is wrong, and forceful conversions need to stop. India is not a mature enough society to take news like this sensible and the reactions are, more often than not, violent.

&gt;In contrast, the rich USA with an area three times the size and only a quarter of India’s population allowed only in 1991 one thousand Tibetan families to enter.

Again, what about the vietnamese, afghans and Jews who fled to the USA? Conveniently ignored.

&gt;There is probably no other country where members of other religions were as safe as in India. Hindus always gave shelter to those who were persecuted in their homelands. Jews gratefully acknowledged that India is the one country where they were never persecuted. Syrian Christians under their leader Thomas of Cana (Thomas the Apostle did not come to India) were given refuge in the 4th century. Parsis came in the 10th century to escape the Muslim invaders in Persia. And in 1959, some 100,000 Tibetan Buddhist refugees found shelter in India

What about the muslim invaders? The hindu-muslim violence? Forgotten?

453,"&gt;Christians, while not under siege, are increasingly becoming a soft target. 

On what basis do you say this? It is not even remotely connected to the ground reality. The Delhi ""Church attacks"" which were blown out of proportion still was 3 attacks. In 2013-2014 Delhi alone had a 100 temples ""attacked"" and or robbed. 

Problem is, a lot of Christians are now convinced thanks to the asshole media that ""Christians are under attack because fascistic Modi"" no matter that this has literally zero connection with reality.

Look at the noise made about and being made about Ghar Wapsi - the hypocrisy here is just off the wall insane. Christians have a ""fundamental right to convert"" and yet Hindus do it? ""Oh my Jesus, this is an attack on humanity / Christians"". If Ghar Wapsi is an attack on Christians, then treat the conversions by the Church as an attack on Hindus, why exclude one from the ambit of ""Attack on xyz""?

&gt;Again, what about the vietnamese, afghans and Jews who fled to the USA? Conveniently ignored.

Vietnamese? Really? The USA killed about...3 Mn Vietnamese at last count, launched Chemical warfare in this poor benighted country, supported a horrible vicious regime - Ngo Dinh Diem's for decades and later accepted about 250,000 South Vietnamese refugees and this is an act of kindness?

Really? 

Afghans? Never knew any migration of Afghans into the USA.

Jews? Yeah sure - Hitler offered to UK and the USA all of Germany's Jews (about a Mn), USA flat out said no. So much for being 'humanitarian'.

&gt;What about the muslim invaders? The hindu-muslim violence? Forgotten?

The author is talking about religious tolerance, how exactly are riots relevant here? Or are you saying India has a history of persecuting religious minorities - note the difference between riots and persecution.

&gt;CATHOLIC churches have history and therefore financial clout. No one in politics gives a shit about the catholics. We are too small in number to matter.

American Evangelical Churches have massive political clout (via the US administration) and massive financial clout. What exactly is your point?

&gt;Both = MSM and Churches.

And what happened in the lastest series of ""Christians under attack"" rhetoric? Media played it 24*7 and in the panels you had these various Christian clerics and assorted spokesperson  and Julio Riberio all saying ""but muh Christianity under attack"". Who colluded? The VHP and the Media?

&gt;Fuck this author. Enough of nonsense.

You seem to be convinced that,

* Christians ARE under attack (reference your whole, soft target line of reasoning)
* Christianity and Christians have little or no financial / political clout in India because of their numbers here
* India has a history of persecuting minorties - but whatabout the religious riots.

Holy fuck!

Y U DO THIS MUDDI? ಠ_ಠ


&gt;“All our campaigns to end bonded child labour, starting from the eighties, will go up in smoke,” Khan said. “Schools will be emptied out, and poor children in states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh will be back to working in sheds and makeshift factories that will all go by the nomenclature of ‘family enterprises.’ The worst-hit will be the children of Dalits, Muslims, tribal families and those belonging to marginalised communities.”

&gt;Such a retrograde step will help ensure millions of kids remain illiterate

It is not just laughable, it is despicable. To create a false narrative of persecution, to get respected Church figures onboard for your panel discussions, to get a person like Ribiero to #presstitute himself and then out of nowhere create this false story of ""Christians under attack in fascist Modi regime"" is terrifyingly evil and undermines everything this very nation. Muslim rioters recently destroyed a temple and burnt farmland (of Hindus) in Bengal recently - where in fucks name is the outrage about that?

This sick media will go the extra length to manufacture outrage, to lie but won't cover...real events?

&gt;dimissing BJP members spreading hatred is also laughable.

Depends what you term hate speech now don't you? Saying ""Hindus should have 4 kids"" is stupid, but how is it even hate speech? The manufactured outrage factory seems to be working though.

Very very weak. BJP by its own estimate has 8.8 Crore members. That is 8.8 Mn people. Or roughly the population of 2 Chennai's. Of course you are going to have hate mongers, bigots and assorted loonies in this lot. Also how do you know he is a ""BJP Member""? 

&gt; There were BJP IT wings (in other states) that spread around false photos and trended that abominable twitter hashtag.

And they gained what exactly? The BJP stands to lose most with these hate speeches on Twitter. Guess who stands to gain the most? Media, INC, AAP etc etc.

3. Now they gave 1500 cr ""bonus"" to AP government when the deficit is more than 15000 cr. 
4. KCR is inflating expenditures on his book to balance his budget. Otherwise it is a minimum of 10000 cr surplus for Telangana.
5. BJP can spend 10000+ Cr on one submarine but cant rescue 5 cr people whose progress has been setback by a minimum of 20 years.

Having said all of that I have only one thing to ask from the BJP government. 

Take the revenues from the states constituting erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and split the money so that AP's revenue deficit is closed. This can continue until 10 years so that AP can bootstrap progress and regain lost time. No other state is affected.

OR

Implement special status for AP as promised by the **Prime Minister** of India on the floor of the house. This will automatically increase state share of central revenue.

Let citizens living in erstwhile AP secretly choose whom their taxes should go to, AP or TG. Even this is enough to fill the deficit.
