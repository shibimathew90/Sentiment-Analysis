0,"This article presents a very serious challenge for the Modi government politically as well (not just the content).

The vernacular media is increasingly critical of the government. Relatively small their readership may be, and they may be less noticeable than grand commentaries made by national figures- but they sway opinions in the grassroots. 

There's a similar trend in Hindi newspapers too. People are getting tired of the grandstanding with little substance.

tl;dr: expect sops and greater populism in the next budget. Middle class, pucker up.",2017-08-14 00:01:43

**Disturbing trend: Why is India's unemployed youth not looking for jobs?** 

 ______ 
Data suggests that India's unemployed youngsters are not looking for jobs. In January 2017, there were 408.4 million employed people in the country. The number of those who were unemployed and seeking jobs was 25.9 million.Seven months later, by the end of July, the number of employed fell to 405.4 million. But the number of those looking for jobs also fell to 13.7 million, according to a report by Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).Why did the unemployed, most of them young, stop looking for jobs?One reason could be they no longer want jobs and are turning entrepreneurs. The government has launched several schemes to promote entrepreneurship. Maybe, the youth increasingly prefer to be their own bosses.Another reason could be they want to study further as latest skills are valued in the market these days. In developed countries, people re-skill themselves during economic slowdowns. It could be a similar phenomenon in India.If they are neither turning entrepreneurs nor enrolling for higher education, what could they be up to? They could actually be doing nothing, which can be a disturbing trend if true, given India's huge youth population.Before sweeping to power in the biggest election win in 30 years, Modi appealed to young job-seekers -- more than half of the population -- with a promise to create 10 million jobs. Three years later it remains unclear how many positions have been created.""The fall in the count of unemployed is concentrated in Uttar Pradesh Bihar , Jharkhand and Odisha. These are the less developed states and these are also the states with the greatest bulge in young population. Such youngsters, who have no jobs and have even stopped looking for jobs could easily stray into unlawful activities. The demographic dividend can become a demographic demon,"" says Mahesh Vyas, the CEO of CMIE.Vyas says this issue needs to be probed further and requires rigorous research.Niti Aayog's Bibek Debroy fears voluntary unemployment could be a bigger headache for India in the coming years. ""Intuitively we know about this (voluntary unemployment). Whether this is girls getting enrolled in schools, children getting enrolled in schools, income levels going up and women opting out, whether it is poorer households investing in education, and therefore not willing to engage in traditional pursuits and more, we intuitively know all this,"" he was quoted by Quartz in a report.While India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies, employment creation in eight sectors, including textiles and automobiles, was the slowest in seven years, according to a 2016 Ministry of Labour report. More than 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, government data show. Between 2011 to 2015, the number of agricultural jobs reduced by 26 million while non-farm ones rose 33 million, according to McKinsey Global Institute.The Centre is now conducting its most ambitious jobs survey to date will reveal annual employment numbers for the whole country and quarterly estimates for its growing cities. The answer could shape Prime Minister Narendra Modi's re-election bid in 2019.

You clearly are not visualizing the spread of Islam since the last 3 centuries over India. I'm no judge to their ideology and righteousness, but the results of it aren't quite admirable even if you look at the situation outside India. Look at Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Turkey; all of them being pure Islamic states and their situation. Immigrant crisis in Europe. Hate mongering and fighting internally with each other.

**Lok Sabha elections to be advanced to sync with state polls next year?** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The possibility of aligning a significant number of state polls with the next Lok Sabha election is being discussed in government circles with the scenario hinging on advancing national polls, along with a few state elections, in sync with assembly polls due in November-December 2018.The discussion is part of an informal exercise intended to explore how to align Lok Sabha and state polls - over time if not in one go - in keeping with PM Modi's oft-repeated view that staggered assembly elections disrupt governance and are a financial burden. The political permutations, said sources, take into account views of former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash C Kashyap and a group of secretaries.The statutory provision that polls can be held within six months of being due is being examined as it will not require complicated measures such an amendment to the Constitution.""In the coming parliamentary polls, the elections to states due within six months or so can be held together as there is a provision that polls can be held within six months if elections are due. This can be done by the Election Commission. It does not require any amendment to Constitution,"" said constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash Kashyap.However, generating a wider political consensus will be a challenge. Advancing Lok Sabha election, due in April 2019, can be aligned with polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram. Barring Mizoram, BJP is in office in rest of the states.In order to increase the number of states that could go to polls simultaneously, it has been suggested that Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha assemblies could be curtailed by a few months if the incumbent parties agreed to such a proposal.Simultaneous elections have worked for BJD in Odisha. For different reasons, co-terminus polls helped TDP ride a Modi wave in Andhra Pradesh in 2014. An alliance may convince TRS to consider a joint campaign with BJP in Telangana.The PM has referred to the need for simultaneous elections many times, pointing out that such an exercise could call for some sacrifice on part of BJP as well as the opposition and it required more than one party or government to make it happen.The political permutations are speculative and are part of an effort to see if simultaneous polls can be even partly viable by the next LS elections. Though Delhi polls is now de-linked from Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan and Mizoram, stability of the assembly will be tested if 21 AAP MLAs are disqualified over office of profit issues and a mini-election ensues.The process, felt Kashyap, could be gradual as it would not be feasible to convince all states due for polls just after 2019 LS elections to give up a part of their tenure. ""If some states are due for polls in one year or so, and if it is your party (same as that at the Centre), the states can seek dissolution of assemblies for holding elections earlier,"" said Kashyap. If unrolled in the next Lok Sabha poll, most assemblies will be in sync over a period of 10 years.

**Sign up with the Robinhood Army, to combat hunger this I-day!** 

 ______ 
It could have been a lazy extended weekend for 18-year-old Muskaan Wadhwani, but she chose to rise early at 6 am that Sunday. Dressed in comfortable jeans and tee, she set out with her friends to Chunnabhatti slum with a mission; that of providing as many food packets and books possible to the kids there. She was a Robinhood that day. While handing out food packets to smiling faces she shares, ""My friend Rishika and I came to know about it through social media and we were waiting eagerly for this drive to kick off in Bhopal . Now all our Sundays are spent being involved with them and I am not complaining!""While the government is still debating upon ways to curtail food wastage in the country, young denizens of Bhopal and Indore decided to take it upon themselves to eradicate the issue rather than conduct debates on it. Without waiting for government agencies, celebrities and big sponsors, these heroes without cape have waged a war against hunger, in the fabled way of their idol and namesake Robinhood! The Robinhood Army , is moving around in Bhopal and Indore to tying up with eateries and even individuals who can come forward to provide hot meals for the less fortunate in their cities. The central India chapter that began in Indore has now reached out to Bhopal and the combined team is now gearing up for a massive Independence Day drive. Last Sunday, our team decided to go on a distribution drive with the Robins to know more about them.The group has made sure that they provide hot meal to the homeless and needy at least once a week across various points in the cities. Pioneered by an enthusiastic Pharmacy student Amit Trivedi, the volunteers are currently engaged in joining hands with eateries across centres. ""We have about 150 members in Indore and about 40 eateries have agreed to partner with us for providing surplus food. Even the district administration is supporting the cause and Mr. Sanjay Dubey, the divisional commissioner of Indore has donated one food van to the volunteers to help them ferry and distribute the food conveniently."" Hearing about the group many volunteers have started signing on and pledging food packets for their daily and weekly drives. Vikram Jeet Singh , a media professional from Indore is supporting the cause by getting food cooked for over 2000 people for the I-Day drive, ""It is going to be a celebration for many who are deprived of good food. I saw a poster of Robin Hood Army on social media calling out to people to support the cause and thought of becoming a volunteer for a day. I am now focussing on Annapurna area where the food would be cooked and served hot and fresh to the people residing in slums nearby.""While things are looking up for the Indore chapter, Bhopal is turning out to be a struggle for now. Sonakshi Sharma, an active volunteer at Bhopal says, ""We're really trying hard to spread the word in the city for people and eateries to come forward for the I-Day drive as well as weekly ones. However, while many have promised to hear us out, there is no confirmation from their side, even as the date for execution keeps nearing. We are about 50 odd volunteers here who are reaching out to at least 10 people each to get at least a 100 on-board."" The volunteers maintain they have reached out to high end restaurants as well. Some smaller restaurant owners however have come forward to donate for the cause. Sanjay Kumar Singh owner of one such restaurant says, ""We are contributing 50 food packets for the drive, which will have complete meal of puri, vegetables, dal and rice. We are ready to cook even fresh food daily for 50 people easily. Even before RA we had been contributing food to old age homes and orphanages. Hopefully they are able to collect daily basis. I believe we should contribute in many small ways rather than waiting for one big fancy opportunity."" So far only 2 eateries have confirmed for giving out their surplus food to the volunteers ""sadly there is no change in the number as yet, but we are hopeful that people of Bhopal will come forward soon"" sighs Amit optimistically.The group is currently gearing up for an across the border initiative of feeding at least a million people on 14and 15of August throughout India and Pakistan. Since these two countries will be celebrating Indpendence Day on the corresponding dates, they are launching this massive drive for freedom from hunger. Central India plans to contribute food for 17,000 people over these two days in Indore and Bhopal. The group has thus, urged youngsters to come forward and be a Robin for the day. ""We can never have enough hands to feed the ever increasing hungry mouths in our cities. If people wish to dedicate their holiday by serving others, they can contact us through our social media sites and pages or get in touch with any volunteer they know.""""The entire hotel association is supporting the cause that includes cafes, marriage and party lawns as well. It is the best utilisation of the surplus food which is left with the hotels daily. We have been supporting the RHA in Indore since the time they have come into existence. However, it won't be just a day's celebration but a dawn of a noble cause. The idea is to make the public aware and continue with the practice.""- Sumit Suri, Chairman of Hotel and Restaurant Association , western region""In food business, specially at hostel mess there is a lot of surplus. While looking for ideas to curb wastage I stumbled upon their page on Facebook and got in touch with local volunteers for weekly and on-call pick up of extra food which will be then distributed to the needy. We only call them when we have food left for at least 10 people. Te group has also conducted awareness drive in the city, after which a few girls joined them as volunteers.""- Sumit Modi, owner of private girl's hostel in Bhopal

13,"&gt;But to infer from this that the prime minister of India was sarcastically trolling its vice-president on this solemn valedictory occasion was unwarranted. No prime minister would do that. It wasn't vyang that moved Modi, but afsos.

Who Modi? Nah, he would never stoop so low!


&gt;The prime minister spoke in sorrow, not in anger. It must have saddened him that Ansari had been unable to transcend his Muslimness despite the opportunity of high constitutional office. On his penultimate day in office he had chosen to harp on the plight of minorities instead of celebrating the magnanimity of a republic that gave the likes of him a decade in its second-highest office.


&gt;Instead of abasing himself in the cause of the nation that the sangh believes had graciously fostered him and his kind, Ansari had had the gall to take India and its citizenship for granted. A mere 70 years after 1947, Ansari behaved as if Partition had never happened, as if Muslims could be equal stakeholders in India without going that extra yard to prove their patriotism, by suffering in silence, if indeed they were suffering. There are many grave connoisseurs of India's communal temperature who don't think that a rash of lynchings adds up to a fever.

How inconsiderate of Ansari! How discourteous! How self-seeking!

&gt;Priti Gandhi, of the BJP Mahila Morcha tweeted: ""For 10yrs my Hindu majority nation accepted you with open arms, placed you at the pinnacle of power &amp; you still feel uneasy?"" It was this feeling that Modi channelled.

**PM Narendra Modi May Turn Populist, Shun Major Reforms Till Polls: Report** 

 ______ 
The Modi government is unlikely to undertake any major reform in the remainder
of its term (File)

**Mumbai: **

The Modi government is unlikely to undertake any major reform in the remainder
of its term but may channel its energy to publicise achievements and emerge
more people-friendly with lower taxes, says a report.

""Rather than look to conquer new ground in the run-up to the 2019 hustings, we
expect Prime Minister Narendra Modi to focus on cementing the success of his
reforms and infrastructure projects already started. More focus will be on
administrative initiatives and not new legislative reforms on the
macroeconomic front,"" Barclays India chief economist Siddhartha Sanyal said in
a weekend note.

""Notwithstanding his aggressive reforms since 2014, we believe Modi will be
selective in picking his battles and deploying his political capital ahead of
the 2019 polls. A likely absence of near-term benefits will likely remain a
constraining factor against launching new reforms in the run- up to the polls.

""Closer to the polls, Modi might consider deploying his political capital more
to boost BJP's 'nationalist' credentials rather than its 'reformist' image"",
argues Mr Sanyal.

If at all he does indeed accelerate reforms over the next 18 months, those
will purely be based on the success or failure of such initiatives over the
medium term, he notes.

At best, he may attempt to complete the aborted reforms like land and labour
laws amendment, but will not push it hard, given the limited immediate
benefits likely from them.

""Therefore, ahead of the 2019 hustings, we expect Modi's policy initiatives to
evolve around three 'C's -- combating corruption; completing existing policy
priorities (resolving NPAs, fine-tuning GST, completing infra projects etc;
and communication to highlight how his various initiatives are helping the
common man, especially in rural areas,"" Mr Saynal says.

A communication blitzkrieg may focus on the benefits of the government
policies for the common man (low inflation, anti-corruption efforts, direct
benefit transfer, stronger infrastructure like electricity, roads, irrigation
etc).

Having achieved some success on the anti-graft drive (over Rs 4,313 crore
black money have been unearthed since May 2014), Modi may play up this again,
says the report.

""Strong anti-corruption rhetoric is likely to stay at the core of Modi's
policy framework, especially given the rich political dividend the BJP has
enjoyed from the banknotes ban.

There is a possibility of stricter political funding rules, a crackdown on
benami properties and progress towards greater disclosure of overseas assets
of citizens,"" Mr Sanyal says.

""Modi will keep the rhetoric against corruption, including stricter norms of
funding political parties, high- pitched ahead of the polls,"" says the report.

On the macro front, he is unlikely to attempt any new ambitious legislative
reforms until H1 of 2019 and is likely to focus on improving the delivery of
government services and ease of business, he says.

**Banks wary of Modi government's merger plan for fear of loss of brand name** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is looking at consolidation of at least two state-run banks in this financial year, but some of the lenders identified for merger or takeover by bigger entities have expressed serious reservations on their identities being subsumed in the process.The target banks are keen that their names survive the consolidation and they continue to have a strong role in business operations, officials said. Earlier this year, four state-run banks – Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank – made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.“We have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.“These are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. “We already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.”In 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. “The idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,” the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was “actively working” towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. “We are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,” Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore — the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.

17,"&gt; ...ironically, instead of helping the government tackle its fiscal deficit, the impact of demonetisation on RBI’s balance sheet will queer the pitch this year

This. There is seriously no way the government can cover this up. Already, the government always fails to reach its disinvestment target each year. If fiscal deficit target is missed, it will be a big screw-up. This will also jeopardise the future political calculations of the government. The 2018-19 budget will be the last chance for Modi to announce a significant cut in income tax, by revision of slabs, and wooing the middle class ahead of 2019 elections. But if fiscal deficit misses the target, making and justifying that announcement to investors and ratings agencies will be difficult.

&gt; The assets under management by mutual funds rose to Rs20 trillion in July, with the flow of money into equity schemes doubling. The premia collected by life insurance companies also more than doubled in November 2016. About 85% of the total collection of Life Insurance Corp. of India—which saw its premia collection rise 142% in November 2016—were under the ‘single premium’ policies, paid in lump sum. If the shift from physical to financial savings lasts for good, then the cost of capital will come down and the much-criticized demonetisation will be a boon for the Indian economy.

And this. IMO, the shift from physical to financial has been happening even before DeMon. That is largely due to property prices being stagnant and increased awareness about mutual funds. ",2017-08-14 10:27:57

**The inside story of why BJP's biggest policy champion may have jumped Modi's ship** 

 ______ 
The departure of one of the few high-profile economists advising India’s government is a reminder of how greatly expectations have changed since the first heady days after Narendra Modi took office in May 2014. Then, the government’s unprecedented legislative majority and Modi’s own rhetoric raised expectations that he would focus on opening up India’s economy to the world. Today, the government feels more like it’s turning inward, seeking growth in the traditional manner through state action and spending, and allowing social and political considerations to dominate the policy conversation.Columbia economist Arvind Panagariya’s decision to leave government encapsulates those worries. In January 2015, when hopes for big-bang reforms were still high, the government eliminated one of the most prominent remnants of India’s socialist past: the Planning Commission, set up by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during the high noon of central planning in the 1950s. The body became instead the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI “Aayog” -- Hindi for “policy commission.” (Modi has a well-known weakness for acronyms and bilingual puns.) Panagariya was named its first administrative chief.The move seemed to confirm hopes that the government intended wholesale changes to India’s sclerotic economy. Panagariya was a highly regarded theorist of international trade who had written several books on openness, markets and the state in India. He seemed to have a clear vision of the sort of constraints that the state has imposed on the Indian economy. His criticism was particularly on point when it came to the manufacturing sector, which he argued had been artificially stunted in India by over-regulation, particularly of the labor market.Many expected NITI Aayog to serve as an incubator within the government for reformist, outward-looking economic ideas. Instead, hopes that the revamped commission would lead to a transformation of India’s economy on Panagariya’s preferred lines -- with coastal states adopting business-friendly regulations and plugging into global supply chains to generate jobs -- have been belied. These are seen increasingly as “Western” ideas that should be rejected; Panagariya’s successor wrote just last week, “Policymaking [is] being liberated from external, more specifically deeply ingrained Anglo-American influences.”The few reform-minded outsiders in Modi’s government seem to have found themselves fighting rearguard actions against components of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party , or others from its stable of right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations. One of those, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, has gone after NITI Aayog for its supposed “pro-corporate” agenda, accusing the institution of “lobbying” for pharmaceutical companies. Meanwhile, the BJP’s associated trade union has firmly blocked labor reforms -- even arguing that laws allowing women to work after dark were Western-influenced and not right for India.Nor have the government’s few experts managed to restrain some of its odder policies. None of them, for example, were consulted about Modi’s disastrous decision to suddenly withdraw 86 percent of India’s currency last November. Even changes like the goods and services tax, or GST -- one of the government’s most worthy reforms -- betray through their complexity a decision to prioritize politics over sound economics. One of Panagariya’s fellow economists at NITI Aayog recently pointed out that “we should have been much closer to the ideal GST.” He added “the government is slightly upset with me” for holding that view.While no one can know Modi’s mind for certain, the prime minister at least hasn’t intervened in favor of the pro-market “side” in such disputes. The result: deadlock.Panagariya, who announced last week that he would soon return to Columbia, wasn’t forced out. But he’d long been marginalized. Before he took over NITI Aayog, he served briefly as an adviser to Rajasthan’s government, which took his ideas far more seriously; it implemented an entire set of major changes he’d proposed, including to labor laws.By contrast, in New Delhi, more and more power has been given to career bureaucrats. Whatever policy influence NITI Aayog boasts appears to come from the fact that it is run by one of Modi’s favourite civil servants.Indian bureaucrats aren’t generally supporters of effective reform -- particularly changes that reduce the power of India’s state. Judging by the rhetoric surrounding Panagariya’s exit, the government now seems to believe that India doesn’t need a Margaret Thatcher or even a Deng Xiaoping; just cleaning up administration and a few tweaks to existing law are enough to supercharge growth. “Outsiders” with all their “Western” ideas don’t get Indian realities and try to do too much. This distrust sounds a lot like the socialist India of the 1960s and 1970s.This is bad news. If the government now sees reformist thinking as inherently “Western” and alien to Indian tradition, the chances of sustained high growth -- the sort that would turn India into a middle-income country in a few decades -- is off the table. That’s not the outcome any true patriot should be seeking.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.)

**46 Dead In Himachal Pradesh Landslide, Rescue Operations Resume** 

 ______ 
Two government-run buses came under the landslide in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi.

**Shimla: **

Rescue work has resumed this morning a day after at least 46 people were
killed and several injured following a massive landslide that buried two
government-run buses in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district, officials said. The
number of people killed could rise as over 50 passengers were travelling in

the two buses hit by the landslide at Kotpuri near Padhar on the Mandi-
Pathankot national highway

which was triggered by a cloudburst, they said.

Some other vehicles may also have been hit by the landslide, the officials
said. ""46 bodies have been recovered and of these 23 have been identified,"" an
official said.

Rescue operations were suspended late evening as there were apprehensions of
more landslides, he said. The rescue work will resume today.

The Indian Army also helped in the rescue efforts in the landslide in Himachal
Pradesh.

Teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the army and the police
were sent and heavy earth-moving machinery called in at the gorge where the
two buses lay buried under a heap of debris.

Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh visited the spot and said the rescue operation
would continue till the last body was recovered. The state government would
bear medical expenses of the injured passengers, he said. Mr Singh also met
the family members of the victims. The state government has announced Rs 5
lakh compensation for the family of those killed.

Rescue operations were suspended for the night in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi
district.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also condoled the deaths.

&gt; Pained by the loss of lives due to landslide related accidents in HP's Mandi
district. My condolences with the families of the deceased: PM

&gt;

&gt; \- PMO India (@PMOIndia) August 13, 2017

State Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur, Transport Minister GS Bali and Rural
Development and Panchayati Raj Minister Anil Sharma also visited the spot.

The massive landslide, covering an area of more than 250 metres, swept away
two other vehicles also and damaged some houses.

The highway was closed and hundreds of vehicles were stranded on either side,
officials said.

DD Sharma, Director, Disaster management, Himachal Pradesh government said
that a team of forensic experts had also been called considering that several
of the bodies were mutilated.

**Sacked Gorakhpur Paediatrician Made 'Scapegoat,' Say Doctors In Delhi** 

 ______ 
Gorakhpur Tragedy: Government put the blame on Dr Kafeel Khan for not taking
prompt action.

**Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh: **

Doctors at Delhi's AIIMS have alleged that a paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan has
been made the ""scapegoat"" at a hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur, where
more 60 children died last week.

Dr Khan, who was head of paediatrics and the children's encephalitis wards at
the hospital, was removed on Sunday.

""Doctors are being made scapegoats,"" said Dr. Harjit Singh Bhatti, who heads
an association of resident doctors at the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences or AIIMS. The association has written a letter condemning Dr Kafeel
Khan's sacking, accusing the state government of ""gross neglect of public
health."" By blaming doctors for the death of the children, the association
said, ""politicians are hiding their incompetency,"" and asked, ""Who is
responsible if oxygen, gloves, equipment not available?""

Last Thursday, at the BRD Medical College and Hospital, Gorakhpur's largest
hospital filled with premature newborns and children suffering from
encephalitis which plagues the area, the supply of liquid oxygen dipped to a
critical low. 23 children died at the hospital that day and parents and others
have blamed the oxygen shortage for some of the deaths.

Amid calls from opposition parties for his resignation,

UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised ""standard setting punishment""
for those found guilty of negligence

in an investigation into the large number of child deaths at the hospital, as
his government denies emphatically that the shortage of oxygen led to deaths.

Yogi Adityanath visited the Gorakhpur on Sunday and said ""standard setting
punishment"" will be given to those found guilty.

The hospital maintains that there was a shortage of oxygen only for about two
hours on Thursday, after the hospital's regular vendor stopped supply over
non-payment of bills, but that liquid oxygen was soon sourced from other
places.

The head of the hospital Dr Rajeev Mishra was suspended on Saturday

, while Dr Kafeel Khan, on whose watch oxygen supply dipped to a critical low
at the hospital on Thursday, was removed yesterday. Government sources said he
was sacked for failing to take action on a letter that was written on Thursday
morning by those in charge of the hospital's oxygen supply, warning that that
there was only enough to last till the evening and asking for emergency
supplies.

""We are not saying that the doctor can't be responsible, but he's not the only
one responsible. We want a proper enquiry, government officials are also
involved and even they should be held accountable. Not just a single doctor,""
said Dr Bhatti of AIIMS, who emphasised that hospitals lack infrastructure and
basic facilities.

Chief Minister Adityanath said yesterday that he was at the hospital in
Gorakhpur, his parliamentary constituency for almost 20 years, just a day
before supply was disrupted, but no one informed him that there was a crisis.
""I was here on the 9th and I categorically asked about encephalitis but no one
informed me. We made payment (to the oxygen vendor) on August 7. Why didn't
the hospital administration make the payment?"" he said.

Parents who lose their children in the Gorakhpur hospital tragedy said oxygen
supply was low at the neo-natal ICU ward

The state government says that while it has released funds to hospital to
settle the oxygen vendor's dues, his bills were not paid by the hospital
administration till Friday, August 11. Dr Rajeev Mishra, who resigned after he
was suspended, has blamed red tape.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been regularly briefed, the Centre has
turned down demands for a separate investigation.

Union Health Minister JP Nadda announced that an 85-crore regional medical
centre would be set up in Gorakhpur for research on diseases that afflict
children.

37,"That is the problem with people in India, in general.

When you keep people hungry and then at the end of the day give them a bread, they will be grateful for that. They will be so happy. And an illusion is given to them that we are doing our best to make everyone rich (or at least garibi hatao), every 5 year.

Everyone remained hopeful and the trend continued, while rest of the countries (say China) in the same time, from the same position went on to becoming a superpower.

When you talk about flyovers and highways, they are riddled with corruption, delay, poor quality and what not. It is same situation, people do not know what they should get, what is their right, but in the end they say, at least we got a flyover, but they do not understand that if it was a western country, they could have made two flyovers with proper planning and no corruption.

Cable TV, MNC, Metro, Internet, 4G are either private or public private partnership. Why don't you look at pure public services? Try to visit a government office, hospital, school and you will know what we have lost, and again if you want to see what we could have had, just visit China.

Those 50 years were bhakti, later economy was opened because of IMF pressure but again slowed down. Modi is no God, he can not fix the 70 years of mess in 3 years, nor can one party. It will take time, maybe 20 years to be at better position. But when there are changes, people oppose changes because change for better means more work and more pain.

40,"My comment never mentioned Congress-BJP, it's just you who's turned my comment into the same duality contest that Indians love to do between these two political parties.

My point remains the same. India has been run like shit constantly. I don't see what's impressive about flyovers and highways when all our governments have failed to control and educate the public about basic issues like family planning, hygiene, and cleanliness which makes India look like the poor, over-populated shithole it's made out to be. 

But to expect Modi to single-handedly fix India in 3 years is a bit preposterous, and so is this notion of India being under a totalitarian regime that we see so much on randia. IMO the closest India got to being a totalitarian regime was during the 1984 riots and the implementation of TADA. India right now is nowhere even close to what that period was like. 

Honestly, it makes me laugh that you think Congress should be lauded for ""bringing"" internet, cable TV, and 4G to India. Seriously? A government should be praised for bringing long-established modern inventions?

**Across the Aisle: India at 70 – The Economy** 

 ______ 
There is a steady decline in the growth rate of Gross Value Addition (GVA) since Q4 of 2015-16 and, correspondingly, in the growth rate of GDP. There is a steady decline in the growth rate of Gross Value Addition (GVA) since Q4 of 2015-16 and, correspondingly, in the growth rate of GDP.

Freedom, a written Constitution, parliamentary system of government, and rule of law have several purposes and objectives: one of the foremost is that they will lead to the social and economic progress of the people of a country.

Imagine taking responsibility for the governance of a country in 1947 when 83 per cent were illiterate, life expectancy at birth was 32 years, per capita income at current prices was Rs 247, and per capita consumption of electricity was 16.3 kWh per year. Lesser mortals would have concluded that India was ungovernable. The Father of any other Nation would have seized absolute power and done his best — or worst — to run a government according to his whims.

Not Mahatma Gandhi, who did not aspire to be in the government and preferred to serve the people in his own way. Not Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and others who bravely shouldered the awesome responsibility of governing a vast and volatile nation.

Markers of Success

India has come a long way since August 15, 1947. Only the blind — and the bhakts (no intent to disrespect) — will argue that nothing, absolutely nothing, was accomplished in the last 70 years. They refuse to acknowledge —

the rise in life expectancy at birth to 68.34 years;

the rise of per capita income (at current prices) to Rs 1,03,219 per year;

the rise in literacy to 73 per cent;

the reduction in the proportion of people living in poverty to less than 22 per cent;

the self-sufficiency in food grains and the avoidance of famine;

the conquest of plague, kala azar, small pox and polio;

the advances in science and technology, especially space and atomic energy, with limited resources.

Every major political party of India had a role to play in the development story. The Congress was at the head of the Central government for nearly 55 years. Non-Congress parties ruled for 15 years; of these, the BJP was/is at the head of the Central government for nine years (Mr Vajpayee and Mr Modi).

Governance of India is not by the Central government alone. State governments have an equal responsibility. Matters directly affecting the lives of the people fall under the authority of the state governments (See Constitution, Seventh Schedule, List II). Because governance at the state level is so uneven, development at the state level is also terribly uneven. As on March 31, 2017, the per capita income of Delhi was Rs 2,49,004 and of Goa was Rs 2,42,745, while the per capita income of Bihar was Rs 31,380 (base year: 2014-15).

Who has been in the government in the poorest states of India? The Congress has not been in power in Uttar Pradesh since 1989; in Odisha since 2000; in West Bengal since 1977; and in Bihar since 1990 (it was a minor partner for 20 months until July 2017). The Congress can therefore be hardly blamed for their poor governance in recent decades. On the other hand, the BJP was in power in UP during 1997-2002 and again since this year; the BJP shared power in Odisha during 2000-2009; and the BJP shared power in Bihar during 2005-2014 and shares power again now.

Five Indicators

It is time to do a health-check of the economy as free India completes 70 years:

Jobs: There is more evidence that we have jobless growth. According to the Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy (CMIE), between January and April 2017, the economy shed 1.5 million formal sector jobs.

GDP growth: There is a steady decline in the growth rate of Gross Value Addition (GVA) since Q4 of 2015-16 and, correspondingly, in the growth rate of GDP.

Investment: In the 12-month period from Q4 of 2015-16 to Q4 of 2016-17, Gross Fixed Capital Formation at constant prices fell from 30.8 per cent to 28.5 per cent. It was 32.6 per cent in 2013-14 and had touched a high of 34.31 per cent in 2011-12 (base year: 2011-12).

Credit Growth: 2016-17 ended with a credit growth rate of 8.16 per cent, which was less than one-half of the average annual growth during the last 10 years. Industrial Production: In the last three years, the Index of Industrial Production has moved, sluggishly, from 111 in May 2014 to 119.6 in June 2017.

Celebration without Joy

These are the five indicators that should be on the dashboard of the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister but, apparently, they are not. Both talk on everything under the sky except on the economy. The Prime Minister has the talent to turn attention away from a catastrophic economic situation to political issues. The Finance Minister is happy to throw out some inconsequential statistics that carry no credibility with economists of repute. There is no more than one person in the government who will speak truth to power at least occasionally.

Yet the government will lead the ‘celebration’ of India at 70. Who will join them? Not the 22 per cent at the bottom of the pyramid, not the farmers, not the manufacturers of goods or their workers, not the lenders or the potential borrowers, not the young job seekers, not those denied education loans and higher education, not women, not the Dalits, and not the minorities. It will be a celebration without joy.

Honestly, as citizens of a Democratic and Republic country, we should be looking at every leader with a microscope.
Maybe your MP is from the opposition, but is he doing a good job for you?

I have the theory called the Relevance of Government. List 4 items that affect you negatively when you wake up. potholes and roads are number 3 on mine. So, if you ask me, I am dissatisfied with the governments of the last 20 years, not just Mr. Modi.

Lastly, start hawking your:
Municipal Corporator
Member of Legislative Assembly
Member of Legislative Council (if you live in a state with a Vidhan Parishad and are eligible to vote for the Graduate's and/or Teacher's Constituencies)
Member of Parliament.

As Indians, we give power to these 3/4 people from our constituency to direct our lives for the next 5 years. It is important that we conduct a performance review of these men and women.

Or, we can just go back to being screaming and fighting tribes with 2017 luxuries.

TL;DR : I do not say he is a saint or not, I appreciate where he does good. I criticize where he does wrong. I hold him to the highest possible standard as the leader of my country.",2017-08-14 14:08:19

50,"Anybody old enough would remember the 3A's (it wasn't Modi/Venkayya  who started this shit about 2C and 4Bs) of power corridor back in the congress heyday. Amitabh, Amar (Singh of SP) and Anil (Ambani), they were the best of friends and had access to the powers that be. Anil obviously had the Ambani name, Amar Singh was the Chanakya/fixer of Indian politics back then (till he removed his pants in a press conference), but Amitabh was not a upstart as many think.


Amitabh and Rajiv were friends because their parents/grand parents were friends, there was nothing opportunistic about it, they were friends since they were 5/6 year old, it was said that Amitabh played a major role in convincing Indira to allow the marriage of Rajiv and Sonia.


The turning point was the Bofors case, at this point Amitabh had won the Allahabad lokshabha seat on a congress ticket that too  against ex-CM with a record margin, when Amitabh due to his closeness to the Gandhi's was also accused (by the media, especially the then journalist Arun Shourie) in the scandal. he was never convicted or even set on proper trail (there was no evidence). 

From here it's all guess work, since everyone involved has kept their mouth shut.

Most believe that Amitabh started to move away from the Gandhi's in the political sphere, though he was still on good terms with Rajiv but not with Sonia (since he believed that Bofors was Sonias doing). This not-so-public relation was maintained till the death of Rajiv, he was also prominently present during the last rites of Rajiv Gandhi.But after Rajiv's death the two families seem to have totally separated.

There are two version of what happened from here on.


The first one is, many in the congress wanted Amitabh to get back into Congress to help Sonia and he refused. This pissed off the Congress and the Gandhis.


Second is, Sonia did not want Amitabh in Congress, since that would create an alternate power center.


Whatever the reason, the final nail in the coffin came during the bankruptcy of ABCL around 1996-97, he probably expected some help from the congress, which did not obviously come, that was a funny time of Indian politics and congress was not in much of a bargaining position.


Amitabh was ""helped"" out by his friend Amar Singh (with Anil and Subrata Roy of Sahara group), Amar was the fixer of Indian poltics back then, you know Nira Radia, he was her predeccessor (and funnily enough has his own set of ""tapes"" scandal nicknamed ""Amar Singh ke Amar Khani"") and he could fix a lot of things, he also got Jaya into Rajya Shabha (She is still in RS after being re-elected). How or why did Amar and Amithabh fell apart is not clear, the general theory is that Amar wanted Jaya to resign from RS seat when he was thrown out of SP and she refused.

Now coming to Modi, there was very little history behind Amitabh-Modi friendship before the Gujarat mein time guzaroo ads, Modi knows that Amitabh makes good PR (Bachan had done a PR for other tourist spots before Gir), hence was used for the ads and now for GST as well, but he has very little invested in Amitabh and if you look at it from purely political point of view, Amitabh getting caught in IT would look good to Modi, since many believe that he is protecting Amitabh. So Amitabh really was better of being friends with SP/Congress atleast he could have claimed the victim card if there are raids.",2017-08-14 14:42:23

**Opinion: Congress' Rahul Or Sonia Dilemma Is Doing Wonders For Modi** 

 ______ 
Indian politics is interestingly poised at the moment. At one end of the pole
is Mr Modi who is changing the basic texture of a well-established edifice and
at the other end is the opposition which is hopelessly hanging on to the last
vestiges of the old establishment; people are caught in the middle and the
intellectuals are standing virtually in no man's land. When the old
establishment is challenged, ""anxiety, despair and disappointment"" are the
natural corollaries of the proven past. ""Caution and skepticism"" are the
hallmarks of the transition and interregnum. Boisterous optimism and reckless
confidence defines the new identity, the personality of the new being, noise
not silence is the mid-wife of the new change. Nobody knows whether the change
brought by the new regime, in terms of ideological foundations and political
super structure, is permanent or not. It is in this context that a lot of
anxiety is visible in the opposition camp, but Modi seems pretty relaxed.

There is a kind of mystery around opposition unity. There is speculation and
there are serious doubts. There are questions of mortality and longevity and
also issues of unity in diversity. The Modi camp, on the other hand, looks
cohesive and muscular, bound together with mammoth state power and
Machiavellian tricks, and the fragile opposition is shaken with every blow. It
is not too long ago that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, till then
perceived to be the tallest opposition leader and supposedly the architect of
opposition unity, royally ditched the bandwagon and climbed aboard the Modi
train. It dealt a crushing blow to opposition unity. Before any attempt at
recuperation, the opposition contended with new murmurs air that Sharad Pawar
may also follow Nitish's path. His party decided to not attend the meeting of
16 parties called by Sonia Gandhi last week. No conclusive reason was given.
It is understood that the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election is to be blamed for the
new glitch. Apparently, Sharad Pawar's party did not support Ahmed Patel and
both the NCP MLAs voted for the BJP candidate.

Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar were never the best of friends, nor do they
share a cordial relationship despite Sharad Pawar being part of the UPA and a
cabinet minister in Manmohan Singh's government for ten years. One must
remember that Sharad Pawar was a Congressman to begin with but during the
mid-70s, he formed his own group, ditched his mentor Vasantdada Patil and
became the young Chief Minister of Maharashtra. It was Sonia's husband, Rajiv
Gandhi, who brought back Sharad Pawar in the Congress in the late 1980s. After
his sudden death and with the Congress emerging as the single-largest party in
the 1991 elections, Sharad Pawar positioned himself as a serious candidate for
Prime Minister but had to surrender before Narasimha Rao. The rumour was that
it was Sonia Gandhi who tilted the balance against Sharad Pawar and that
Narasimha Rao was her choice. It is said that Sharad Pawar has not forgotten
this till now. He was young, he had the support base, and among all the
contenders, he had the resources and the most number of MPs, but he failed
because he could not convince Sonia Gandhi that her husband's friend would
remain loyal to her. She chose Narasimha Rao who posed no threat to the Nehru-
Gandhi legacy.

It was this simmering tension which finally culminated in a split when Sonia
Gandhi was made the president of the Congress party. Sharad Pawar was the man
who raised Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin and along with P A Sangma and Tariq
Anwar formed his own party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). But by 2004,
when the Congress came back to power and Manmohan Singh became the Prime
Minster, Sharad Pawar's political clout had depleted majorly, and his party
was playing second fiddle to the Congress even in Maharashtra politics. He
coyly joined the UPA and had to be satisfied with the low-profile Agriculture
Ministry. Now Sharad Pawar and his party are too weak to pose any threat to
the BJP-Sena government in Maharashtra. Based on his stature and experience,
it is assumed that he could play the role of a senior statesman in uniting the
opposition. But if he is upset, then it is a bad omen for the anti-Modi front.

Modi and Amit Shah are working on a single-point agenda: that opposition unity
should remain a mirage till 2019 and that in the process, the Congress ends up
completely isolated. The unleashing of government agencies against Lalu Yadav
and his family was a well-thought out strategy to create a wedge between Lalu
and image-conscious Nitish Kumar. It worked beautifully for Modi. Nitish is
now solidly with Modi and very soon, JD(U) ministers will be seen in his
cabinet too. Now Lalu is not mincing his words, his son Tejashwi is travelling
through Bihar on a mass-contact yatra to galvanise his social base and
solidify the backward-minority combine vote bank. He is also working to get
back the Dalit vote by requesting Mayawati to run for the Rajya Sabha from
Bihar. Lalu is also working on plans to get Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
together on the same platform to stop Modi In his own burrough of Uttar
Pradesh. But with Nitish's defection, the damage is already done. And the
opposition has been left licking its wounds.

The problem with the opposition is far deeper. Since Congress has been the
ruling party for 54 out of 70 years of independence, most political leaders
have spent a major part of their political career opposing the Congress and
its policies. Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Sharad
Yadav, Deve Gowda, Karunanidhi, Naveen Patnaik have emerged leaders in an
""anti-Congress"" ambience. These leaders are not naturally comfortable in the
company of the Congress. And the Congress is not used to coalition politics
despite spending ten years running a coalition government from 2004 to 2014.
They always consider themselves to be the natural party of governance. It is
to be remembered that the Indian political spectrum has taken a paradigm shift
since the emergence of Modi at the national level, and ""Anti-Congress-ism"" has
been replaced by ""Anti-BJP-ism"", but even so, old habits die hard. The
Congress is finding it difficult to adjust to the new realities and other
opposition leaders are at odds to adjust to the Congress style of functioning.

The Congress is also riddled with inner tension. Though Sonia Gandhi is still
holding the reigns of the party, Rahul Gandhi is waiting in the wings; the
transition is taking longer than desired and is breeding insecurities. The
party is speaking in different voices, leaders are discussing different
strategies, a game of sabotage and survival is on. Senior leaders are
definitely not comfortable with Rahul Gandhi and his style. Rahul Gandhi till
now has not been able to form his own team and he does not command the respect
of other parties either. The leaders pf other parties are far more senior and
experienced than him so they do not heed his opinions. Sharad Pawar, for all
his reservations with Sonia, will be more at ease with her than her son.

Therefore, for the opposition to form an effective unit, it has to evolve its
own cohesive ""centre"" and that will only happen if the Congress becomes a
cohesive unit with a well-defined cohesive ""centre"". So Modi can sit happy as
long as the Congress is not able to figure out who will be its leader or
advisers to the leader. The counter narrative that the anti-BJP front needs to
present is affected by all this. It can take shape only if the Congress
adjusts to the new realities of India and its challenges. Unfortunately, it is
still in the old mould. So opposition unity will hit more speed-breakers
before it attains any kind of shape.

**Create 'Mass Fervour' Around PM Modi's 'New India' Vision, Centre Tells States; West Bengal Says No** 

 ______ 
West Bengal has refused to create fervour around PM Modi's 'New India' vision
(File).

**New Delhi: **

Ahead of Independence Day, the Centre has written to the states to organise
events in schools towards creating a ""patriotic mood"" and a ""mass fervour"" to
help realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'New India' vision. The West
Bengal government has, however, refused to abide by the direction.

West Bengal has instructed its schools to desist from following the Centre's
circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said, terming the decision of
the Trinamool Congress government as ""unfortunate"".

Mr Javadekar told reporters, the instructions, such as administering of the
prime minister's Sankalp Siddhi oath or commemorating the martyrs of freedom
struggle or ""various wars/terrorist actions"", are not binding on the schools
and were part of a ""secular agenda"".

""It is desirable that this momentous occasion should be celebrated with an
objective to create a festive and patriotic mood across the nation and a
movement is created to involve every citizen of this country in the mission of
realising the vision of a new India, which is clean and free from poverty,
corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism,"" Joint Secretary of the
Ministry of Human Resource Development, Maneesh Garg wrote to the states.

In the letter, Mr Garg also requested the states to publicise the events, to
be held between August 9 and 30, to help create a mass fervour in favor of the
mission.

It added that apart from administering oath, the schools, including those
affiliated to the CBSE, may be asked to organise quiz competitions on the
struggle for Independence and the country's development and painting
competitions on the same theme.

The quiz can be downloaded from the Narendra Modi App or the government's
official portal, it said.

Meanwhile, Mr Javadekar shared a copy of the memo issued by the State Project
Director of the West Bengal Sarva Shiksha Mission, which says that it has been
decided by the school education department that Independence Day will not be
celebrated in line with the Centre's circular.

""The language used in the West Bengal government's memo is strange and
unfortunate. I will talk to them. What we have proposed is a secular agenda,
not a political party agenda,"" he said.

**Once ‘fragile’ India gets thumbs up even as RBI rates are set to fall** 

 ______

Mumbai: When Federal Reserve taper fears jolted emerging markets in 2013, India was one of the worst hit and was forced to raise interest rates to underpin its tumbling markets.

Fast forward to 2017, and history has been turned on its head. Not only is the US central bank raising rates, but India is widely expected next week to be the first country in Asia to cut policy rates in 2017.

And rather than being concerned at India’s falling policy rate premium over the US, foreign investors are giving the country’s markets the thumbs up.

The rupee is rallying and the country’s bonds are in demand, offering some of the best inflation-adjusted returns in Asia. Inflation, long a thorn in the economy, is at its lowest in five years, economic growth is picking up and the current account deficit is a fraction of its old self.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a national goods and services tax (GST) on 1 July, India’s biggest tax reform since independence in 1947, raising confidence among investors that other measures to boost the economy would follow.

“The structural story for India remains pretty strong,” said David Cornell, chief investment officer of London-based Ocean Dial Asset Management, which argues India and other emerging markets will outperform over the next 12 months.

India operates some capital controls, including on foreign investment.

Foreign buyers have almost exhausted their quota in debt with net purchases of $21 billion in 2017—including record high inflows for a January-June period—after net sales of $6 billion in 2016.

An auction of government and corporate bond quotas for foreign investors, which gives them the right to purchase additional debt, was heavily over-subscribed this week.

They have bought a net $8.8 billion in shares, more than the combined $6.3 billion of the previous two years, helping push indexes to record highs.

Long positions in the rupee are the highest among major Asian currencies and almost double those of the second-placed Malaysian ringgit, a Reuters poll shows.

“My view would not change as a result of a rate cut on 2 August. Rate cuts are likely to be justified by lower inflation and higher-trend growth rates in India due to reforms,” said Jan Dehn, head of research for Ashmore Capital, which has more than $57 billion under management.

At a review on Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, which would be its lowest level in more than six years.

It would be the RBI’s first rate cut since October and the first in Asia since the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in December.

Many other central banks have already signalled they are done with the long period of super easy policy that followed the global financial crisis, especially given the prospect of more US rate rises and the potential for the European Central Bank (ECB) to ease up on its bond purchases.

No longer fragile

India no longer resembles the “Fragile Five” country of 2013, when the RBI was forced to raise rates by 75 basis points to arrest foreign investment outflows. Other countries in this group, including Indonesia, Brazil, and South Africa, also took defensive policy measures at the time as their markets came under pressure.

Indian consumer price inflation is now 1.54%, boosting the 10-year bond’s real interest rate to 4.9%, the highest in Asia and nearly double the rate of Indonesia, another popular emerging market investment destination.

The rupee has rallied 5.6% against the dollar in 2017 so far and volatility in the exchange rate is its lowest since mid-August, a reassuring signal for investors.

The current account deficit has narrowed to just 0.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) from a record 4.8% in 2013, while foreign exchange reserves hit a record $389.1 billion as of 14 July.

Economic growth is expected to rise to 7.3% in the fiscal year to March from 7.1% in 2016, a Reuters poll shows.

Doubts?

To be sure, a more aggressive monetary policy trajectory by the Fed or ECB would rattle emerging markets and within India a shift towards more populist measures ahead of elections that must be held by 2019 could unsettle foreign investors.

The RBI is also reluctant to raise foreign debt limits to avoid the risk of sudden outflows later, potentially limiting further gains in the rupee.

Indian shares are also relatively expensive, which may limit future gains. The benchmark National Stock Exchange share index is trading around 21 times its 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio, compared with a five-year average of 17.91.

These negatives are not enough to outweigh the positives though, said Kenneth Akintewe, a senior investment manager for Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore, who says India is one of his team’s bigger overweight positions.

“India’s exposure in local currency emerging market funds is extremely low,” he said.

“From a risk-adjusted perspective, it has been difficult to actually find another bond asset class that has been able to match the performance of Indian bonds. Reuters

**Narendra Modi’s authority is unchallenged. So why isn’t he doing more?** 

 ______ 
Narendra Modi’s experience in the business-friendly state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister for over a decade, may have led him to overestimate what Indian states can do on their own. Photo: Ajay Aggarwal/HT

In just a few years, Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have managed to ensure that they have practically no political rivals of consequence left. Four years ago, the map of India was a patchwork, with the BJP, its national rival Congress and multiple regional parties vying for supremacy at the state and federal level. Today, the BJP has an unprecedented legislative majority in New Delhi, and it runs almost every state of consequence.

One of the last opposition bastions in northern India, Bihar, recently fell to the BJP when a coalition of opposition parties collapsed. The state’s chief minister—once discussed as a possible rival to Modi in the next general election—said resignedly that nobody was strong enough to take on the prime minister. The BJP now controls 18 out of India’s 29 states, accounting for almost two-thirds of the country’s GDP. Modi’s authority is unchallenged. The question is, why isn’t he doing more with this power?

For decades, the unwieldy coalitions that have dominated Indian politics have made it intensely difficult to carry out significant economic reforms. While Modi has a comfortable majority in New Delhi, many changes require state governments on board as well. So, the argument ran, perhaps it would be better for the states to experiment first. In theory, they could act more nimbly, testing various programs and competing with one another to come up with the most innovative and attractive package of reforms. Modi has called this idea “cooperative federalism.”

Also read: BJP’s meteoric rise is ringing alarm bells among its NDA allies

So far, though, there’s little sign of states competing to reform. Some, like Rajasthan, have pushed the envelope by rationalizing labour and land regulations, but other measures have been small beer.

To the contrary, even BJP-controlled states actively seem to be resisting change. Consider the new goods and services tax (GST) India just introduced. It’s a big step towards knitting diverse provinces into a single market. But state governments got every little political carve-out they demanded. Rather than competing to implement the GST more smoothly and effectively, they cooperated to preserve their own income-tax offices and many of their existing privileges.

States seem to be competing only to see who can impose more populist measures, such as forgiving the debts of farmers and, in north India, imposing laws to “protect” cows, held holy by many Hindus. Though they belong to the same party, even the BJP states aren’t stepping up efforts to share policy ideas or coordinate their approach to reforms.

Those state leaders are responsible to Modi, the leader of the party. Modi’s advisers point out that he does talk to many states’ top bureaucrats regularly. But these discussions don’t seem to have resulted in any serious efforts at coordination.

Modi’s experience in the business-friendly state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister for over a decade, may have led him to overestimate what Indian states can do on their own. Gujarat has a healthy exchequer, a long coastline and a functional bureaucracy—a trinity of blessings that no other Indian state possesses. As a consequence, it can trade with the outside world and pretend the rest of India doesn’t really exist. That allowed Modi to craft an independent, outward-looking economic base for Gujarat that leaders of others states, such as landlocked Madhya Pradesh, would struggle to replicate.

For “cooperative federalism” to be more than a phrase, Modi has to realize that most states need constant hand-holding. State governments in India are short of policymakers as well as resources to conceptualize and implement ambitious reforms. The federal government occasionally comes out with “model laws” that the states could supposedly follow. But the states aren’t properly incentivized to implement them, and they receive little follow-up support. More importantly, Modi rarely makes such laws a political priority, which means they are generally ignored.

Now that chief ministers in the entire north and west answer to Modi, here’s one idea he could be working with them on. The north is overpopulated and short of jobs; the west, along the Arabian Sea, is where jobs will be created. India’s previous government planned a corridor stretching from the north to the west along which goods could move easily, and which would be dotted with new, planned towns that could serve as magnets for migration. It was meant to be the “world’s largest infrastructure project.”

India manages migration particularly badly; its cities are overcrowded already, even as most projections indicate that they will be the fastest-growing in Asia in coming years. The sort of migration that is frictionless, which helps people move to where the jobs are, requires cooperation between multiple states and a neutral arbiter in New Delhi to help provide the necessary infrastructure.

There could and probably should be many other such examples. The point is that Modi needs to put some political muscle and federal resources behind such initiatives. He has political capital to spare; this is where he should use it. Bloomberg View

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems invincible today. Most people think he would win a second term in 2019 general elections. He is popular. He has convinced people that he is working for the nation. He has cracked down on corruption. He wields a strong control over the government and the party. And his winning streak continues even after half his term as the PM when most governments turn defensive.But there is one challenge that he might not be able to defeat in 2019. Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian has pointed it out in the second edition of the Economic Survey 2016-17 —the lack of reliable jobs data.""The debate on the measurement issues on employment and unemployment estimates has been ongoing for some time. The lack of reliable estimates on employment in recent years has impeded its measurement and thereby the Government faces challenges in adopting appropriate policy interventions,"" Subramanian writes.Employment situation seems to have worsened during Modi's term. According to various estimates, fewer jobs are being created than people entering the job market. However, many in the government think a large number of people are turning entrepreneurs. The government has launched several schemes—from skill enhancement to business loans—to promote entrepreneurship. But by most accounts, unemployment has become a big issue in India today.In the absence of reliable jobs data, the Modi government may not be able to take any more steps to create jobs. The government can remain blissfully unaware of the jobs crisis which can blow in its face in the 2019 general elections. Since PM Modi relies heavily on young voters, the jobs crisis and lack of adequate measures by the government can erode his most crucial voter base.The survey lists a dozen existing government sources of jobs data but also points out their limitations: ""Partial coverage, inadequate sample size, low frequency, long time lags, double counting, conceptual differences and definitional issues, rarely used for the purpose of employment estimation, etc.""""We don’t really have good reliable consistent series of data to be able to say with some degree of confidence that this went up or this came down. I am hopeful that once we really, improve our employment data, we will be able to do those things much better,"" Subramanian has said in an interview to ET.The government is carrying out a new employment survey which is unprecedented in its reach and depth. More than 100,000 sample households across 7,500 villages and 5,000 urban blocks will be questioned every quarter to generate closer-to-real-time information, creating seven quarters worth of credible and comparable quarterly and annual labor data for the first time. The first tranche of data is expected to be revealed in December next year, according to a Bloomberg report. The government has trained more than 700 researchers to feed data directly on to tablets instead of the usual paper questionnaires.Creating more jobs was Modi's important poll promise. In his next election, he will be answerable on that count. But if the government neither knows the extent of unemployment nor takes adequate steps to create more jobs, Modi will not be invincible.

**from the linked article**

&gt;The Dalai Lama, perhaps encouraged by New Delhi, went on a four-day visit to Mongolia. This was his ninth trip to a place where he is revered, and his photo is kept in many monasteries. China resented this provocation, objected to the Dalai’s visit and warned Ulaanbaatar against hosting him. Ulaanbaatar, confident of India’s support, defied Beijing to receive the Dalai Lama. 

&gt;China struck swiftly with an unprecedented economic blockade. The sanctions paralysed Mongolia’s economy and trade. China slapped a levy on Mongolian goods and trucks entering China. As Russia is too tied to China, Mongolia turned to India, and asked for the promised one billion dollars. 

&gt;Ambassador Gonchig Ganbold, who met Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) officials, told a leading English daily: “It’s important that India raises its voice against the unilateral measures China is taking against us which is hurting our people especially when severe winter is upon us.” Silence, he said, could be construed as giving China a “pass” for its behaviour.” 

&gt;The MEA spokesman’s response was: As a close friend of Mongolia, which India regards as its ‘third neighbour’ and ‘spiritual neighbour’, we are ready to work with the Mongolian people in this time of their difficulty. 

&gt;However, Modi Sarkar was in a funk. There was no trace of the muscle the Prime Minister had displayed to much applause in Ulaanbaatar in May 2015. Any action to ease Mongolia’s difficulties would have meant inviting China’s wrath. Predictably, the political leadership turned a deaf ear to Mongolia’s desperate plea for help. 

&gt;As a result, on December 21, Ulaanbaatar apologised abjectly to Beijing. Mongolian Foreign Minister Tsend Munkh-Orgil promised that the Dalai Lama will no longer be allowed to enter his country.

**Gorakhpur hospital: Fresh deaths reported as politicians trade charges**

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sent a notice to the UP government over the deaths of infants at the Gorakhpur hospital. Photo: PTI

Gorakhpur/Bengaluru: Six more children have died from encephalitis since Saturday at state-run BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur, the government said on Monday.

The death of nearly 70 children, including infants, at the hospital triggered nation-wide outrage and political recrimination. Many of these deaths were alleged to have been caused by a shortage of oxygen, a claim dismissed by the government.

Even as the authorities grappled with the situation, additional director health Pushkar Anand said the fresh deaths occurred between August 12 and 14. “In the past three days -- from August 12 to August 14 -- six encephalitis patients, mostly children have died. In the same period, as many as 21 patients were admitted for treatment. At present nearly 75 encephalitis patients are undergoing treatment in the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital,” he said.

In state capital Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh Congress leaders including state party chief Raj Babbar staged a protest over the tragedy and many of them courted arrest. The Congress has been demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and registration of a case of “murder” over the “massacre” of children.

BJP chief Amit Shah, who is in Bengaluru, rejected the demand for Adityanath’s ouster, saying such incidents had also happened in states governed by the Congress. “It is natural for Congress to ask for Yogiji’s resignation. This is not the first time such an incident has taken place in this large country of ours. Such incidents have taken place during Congress rule in many states,” he told reporters.

Replying to a query, Shah said unlike the Congress, BJP “does not hold anybody guilty” without investigation, which was on. Whey asked why Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who often takes to microblogging website Twitter to express his views, has not tweeted about the Gorakhpur tragedy yet, Shah said he has already voiced his grief over the deaths. “Twitter is not the only medium to convey a message,” he said.

The Congress, meanwhile claimed it had warned the government about the resource crunch at the hospital. Party vice president Rahul Gandhi had warned about funds to the hospital having been “stopped” in September, 2016, and also visited the encephalitis wing, Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said in New Delhi.

Meanwhile, the NHRC has sent a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government over the tragedy, observing it indicated “gross callousness” on part of the health administration. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) asked the state’s chief secretary to submit a detailed report in four weeks on steps taken for relief and rehabilitation of the affected families as well as the action taken against those guilty.

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav visited Gorakhpur and met family members of deceased infants and consoled them. The former chief minister visited two villages and met three bereaved families.

Moved by the Gorakhpur tragedy, BJP Lok Sabha member Varun Gandhi today pledged Rs 5 crore from his MP local area development fund to build a state-of-the-art paediatric wing in Sultanpur district hospital. “The human tragedy in Gorakhpur has left me jolted,” he said.

Health Minister Siddharth Nath Singh, who is facing flak for the hospital disaster, claimed “commissionkhori” (bribery) has come to light at the hospital. “As against the demand for Rs 68 lakh for payment of dues for oxygen cylinders at the hospital, the government released Rs two crore on August five. But the hospital administration made payments not before August 11 and even then it spent only Rs 11 lakh. Why? Because of commissionkhori”, Singh said in Allahabad.

He admitted that health care facilities were inadequate in UP which has a huge population of 22 crore, but promised to bring it back on track. Singh was shown black flags by members of the students wing of the Samajwadi Party when his vehicle entered the city this afternoon. In the last three decades, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) have claimed over 50,000 lives in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, mostly in Gorakhpur district. Till Augusut 8, 124 deaths have been reported. 641 children died last year and 491 in 2015, according to official data.

**Heavy rains kill 41 in Bihar, flood Bengal and northeast; train services disrupted** 

 ______ 
Heavy rains in the last three days triggered flash floods in parts of Bihar, where 41 people have died so far, and inundated large areas in Assam and North Bengal, paralysing normal life and snapping rail link to the northeast from the rest of the country.

In Arunachal Pradesh too, the flood situation continued to be grim in several districts with recurring landslides disrupting road traffic.

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who conducted an aerial survey of flood-hit areas, said Araria was the worst effected district and water has entered the district headquarters.

Flood waters have engulfed areas in Kisanganj, three blocks of Purnea and one block of Katihar damaging roads.

He said heavy rains in Nepal and Bihar in last three days have led to the situation and the state government is carrying out relief operations in flooded areas on a war-footing.

Forty-one people have died in floods in Bihar so far, said the principal secretary, disaster management department, Pratyay Amrit.

Kumar said principal secretaries of disaster management, road construction and rural development departments would make an aerial survey on Tuesday to prepare a detailed report of damage.

The CM thanked the Centre for prompt response in providing assistance to the state after he telephoned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.

Kumar said he also spoke to Union home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley on the flood situation.

The chief minister said besides the Army column (around 50 personnel) which was sent to Purnea, four teams of NDRF had arrived in Bihar on Sunday and six more NDRF teams landed on Monday to assist the state.

The Railway Board has decided to cancel all incoming trains from various parts of the country towards northeast region, which were to reach either Katihar or Malda town till 10 am of August 16, 2017, North Eastern Frontier Railway Chief Public Relations Officer Pranav Jyoti Sharma said in a statement.

“Heavy rainfall in the last 72 hours in West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and other NE states had resulted in railway operations being severely hampered as rain water has inundated railway tracks at several places in Katihar and Alipurduar division of NF Railway,” Sharma said.

In view of the prevailing condition, 11 outgoing trains have been cancelled by NF Railway on Monday, Sharma said adding four other trains have been short terminated at various locations, he added.

On Sunday, 22 trains were cancelled, while 14 others were stranded at various places as tracks were flooded.

“While many rivers in Alipurduar and Katihar divisions were in spate, NF Railway authorities have been keeping a close watch and continuously monitoring the situation of nearby railway bridges and tracks, taking all precautionary measures for safe running of the trains,” he said.

The emergency control was being manned by senior officials at the headquarter and divisions, Sharma said adding train tracks were affected at as many as 12 locations initially, of which seven have been repaired and restored.

Sharma, however, said that train connectivity from New Jalpaiguri to Guwahati, Guwahati to Dibrugarh and Murkongselek continued to be normal.

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said, “We are concerned about the flood situation across the country. Earlier floods had affected south Bengal. Now north Bengal was also affected. We are monitoring the situation round-the-clock for relief and rescue operations”.

State government sources said that Phulahar river had crossed its danger level, while 20 villages, mostly under Harischandrapur Block-II and Ratua block in Malda district were inundated.

Situation was similar at Bhutni Island, while erosion was taking place at Pardeonapur village near Farakka also in Malda district.

Eastern Railway chief public relations officer R Mahapatra said a number of trains originating in the state were cancelled on Monday as water is flowing above the railway tracks in North East Frontier Railway jurisdiction.

The next announcement would be made only after the situation improved, he said.

East Central Railway said that rail traffic has been hit between Kisanganj and Hatwar due to flood water flowing above the danger mark at pillar number 117 under Katihar division.

An ECR statement released by Chief Public Relations Officer Rajesh Kumar said 33 trains have been cancelled and 11 short-terminated.

In Arunachal Pradesh, flood situation continued to be grim in several districts with reports of disruption of surface communication pouring in from various parts of the state.

Remote Anjaw district remained cut off from rest of the state for the past seven days as the main road to the district from Lohit are blocked in several places by landslides triggered by incessant rains, officials said.

Food shortage was looming large in Anjaw district following disruption in surface communication. Intra-district road communications were also badly affected due to landslides.

Though the Border Road Task Force has deployed men and machines to clear road blockades, recurring landslides were hampering restoration work, officials said.

**Modi govt does not deserve the flak it got for Raghuram Rajan’s exit from RBI** 

 ______ 
Most people consider me a critic or, at least, not a supporter of the Modi government. I wouldn’t quarrel with either description. However, I also see myself as an objective and balanced journalist who is duty bound to be fair. In a moment, you’ll understand why I have begun this way.

Two facts, which have come to my attention in recent days, could change the way the media and, indeed, the wider public have viewed the Modi government’s handling of the governorship of the Reserve Bank of India. The prevailing perception is that the government was unfair and ungrateful in denying Raghuram Rajan a second term. Some have even argued he was pushed out. There are also a few who criticised the government for not offering the job to Rakesh Mohan, a former deputy governor, who many thought was the best candidate available.

I hardly need to stress how much flak the government has received for its alleged treatment of Raghuram Rajan. The alleged ignoring of Rakesh Mohan didn’t receive the same level of attention but the cognoscenti were outspoken in their criticism. Well, it seems, on both counts the obloquy was unfair and wrong.

Unimpeachable sources have told me that Mr Rajan was offered a two-year extension. However, the problem was his inability to get a further extension of leave of absence from Chicago University without losing his valuable tenure. Mr Rajan could only stay on for eight additional months.

Quite understandably, the government decided this would be inadequate. It would only add to the uncertainty at the top of the Reserve Bank. It, therefore, opted to choose a new governor.

Seen in this light, it’s clear Mr Rajan was not badly treated and the criticism the government faced on this count was mistaken and unfair. Furthermore, these details were known to a few people but never fully reported, although they were clearly hinted at in an interview Mr Rajan gave the New York Times last September. As the paper put it: “He said that his departure was based on his inability to reach an agreement with the government on serving longer but not serving another full 3 year term.”

Let’s now come to Rakesh Mohan. I’ve very reliably learnt he was approached for the governorship and the government was extremely keen that he accept. Unfortunately, a personal and poignant problem prevented him from responding positively. It would be improper to go into further details but what I can confirm is that he requested the government not to be considered even though this meant a post he would have regarded as the culmination of his career had to be gracefully declined.

However, what I can add is that the government tried its best to find ways of enabling Mr Mohan to accept. Sadly, that wasn’t possible. So, once again, criticism that Mr Mohan was overlooked is both mistaken and unfair.

I’ve recounted these facts both because they reveal the government in a very different light to what many have so far assumed and because I was one of the many critics of its handling of Messrs Rajan and Mohan.

Today I’ve lightened my conscience by sharing these details. However, there’s a lot that this government has done and said that I remain critical of. There’s no U-turn in my overall attitude. But fairness requires I give the government its due. In these two instances its critics and opponents were wrong. I’m making no comment about anything else.

The views expressed are personal

87,"I think he has a much better grip on the BJP party, and one of the reasons is that he has a core inner circle (reminds me of Lord Voldemort) that makes all key decisions. You might have surmised as much from that marathi translated Loksatta article that was posted here yesterday, that those in the outer circle are just passive sidekicks who don't have much say in the party at all.

So basically, as long as this core group is essentially filled with Modi loyalists and yes men such as Shah and Urjit Patel, Modi is actually very safe. The interesting question is what will change this equation and lead to Modi's downfall. I can see two things happening:

1. One of the Modi's loyalists sees the error in things, decides that bhakti has reached a tipping point now, and ditches them by using the media or other means (quite idealistic scenario actually, but I don't see that happening because Modi has a very tight control over his loyalists, it seems).
2. Some new leader in another party (Harry Potter) emerges, gets quite popular and does something so great that even Modi couldn't think of (again, quite dramatic, but don't see any signs of that in the making presently).

There is also a third scenario where the sidekicks quit BJP and join another party (or form one of their own). But this doesn't affect Modi in any big way as they are just sidekicks, unimportant and easily replaceable (like those drop in the ocean IT employees at Infosys and Tech Mahindra). Nevertheless, if these sidekicks manage to find a leader of high caliber who can guide them, then we have a chance.",2017-08-15 00:55:37

**India must be compassionate and egalitarian: President Ram Nath Kovind** 

 ______ 
President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday lay down the markers for a New India, one that would be compassionate towards the disadvantaged and would not discriminate on the basis of gender or religion, as he pitched for a people-government partnership.

In his first address to the nation on the eve of the 71st Independence Day, Kovind, who was sworn in as India’s fourteenth President last month, hailed the government’s demonetisation decision, people’s support in the battle against corruption and the roll out of goods and services tax.

“New India must be a society rushing towards the future... A compassionate society where the traditionally disadvantaged, whether SCs, STs, or OBCs, are part of our national developmental process,” said Kovind, the second Dalit to be the President after KR Narayanan.

In the year 2022, the country would complete 75 years of Independence and “it is our national resolve to attain certain desired milestones for a New India by then”, he said.

In his 30-minute speech, Kovind lauded the sacrifices made by countless freedom fighters as he specifically named Jawaharlal Nehru along with Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Bhagat Singh, Rani Lakshmibai, Ashfaqullah Khan and BR Ambedkar, saying the generation that brought Independence was diverse.

The Congress had taken strong exception to Kovind not mentioning Nehru in his maiden speech to Parliament after assuming the country’s top post.

The 71-year-old Kovind said New India must include “integral humanist component that is in our DNA and which has defined our country and our civilisation”.

The President stressed on the need for a robust partnership between the citizen and government, where every individual contributed to nation building.

The government had started the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) campaign, created infrastructure and was promoting Beti Bachao Beti Padhao but it was for “each one of us” to ensure the success of these schemes, he said.

“The government can frame laws and strengthen law enforcement – but it is for each of us to be a law abiding citizen,” he said.

The government was pushing for transparency and eliminating corruption “but it is for each of us to answer to our inner conscience in everyday life”, he said.

Highlighting various steps undertaken by the Modi government to improve the economy and fight corruption, Kovind hailed citizens for their contribution.

He said partnership between citizens and government was crucial to the success of several flagship announcements of the Modi government such as giving up LPG subsidy, demonetisation, introduction of GST.

“Your immense patience and understanding in the days following demonetisation – and your whole-hearted support in the battle against corruption and black money – reflected a responsible and enlightened society,” Kovind said.

“I am confident that a strong partnership between citizens and the government will allow us to meet the goals of New India.”

The President said demonetisation boosted the government’s effort to build an honest society. “We must sustain this spirit and this momentum,” he said.

Kovind also called upon the citizens to imbibe a “spirit of selflessness”, taking inspiration from the soldiers guarding borders, the police and paramilitary who brave death to combat terrorism and crime, and the farmers who labour under extremely tough conditions to grow food.

 ______ 
Highlights 1 New India by 2022 will be free of corruption and terrorism: PM Modi.

2 Year 2022 will mark the 75th year of Independence.

3 Congress have slammed PM Modi calling his speech false promise.

While addressing the nation on 71st Independence Day today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi insisted that there would be a New India by 2022 - when India will mark 75 years of independence.

""I Invoke Team India to run for a New India by 2022. By then the poor shall have concrete houses, the farmer shall double his income, youths and women will get ample opportunities, an India free of casteism, terrorism, corruption, nepotism, a clean India,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

PM Modi spoke on a plethora of issues concerning the nation. He spoke extensively on topics ranging from mob violence to the ongoing issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Talking to an energetic crowd, PM Modi instilled hope in many saying that a new hope had replaced the prevalent hopelessness.

""The usual attitude of 'chalta hai, theek hai, chalne do' (complacency) has been replaced and a new chapter has begun,"" said PM Modi.

Addressing the nation from the Red Fort, Modi warned those indulging in mob violence, saying attacks in the name of ""aastha"" (faith) was not something to be happy about and won't be accepted.

In a 56-minute speech, his fourth from the Red Fort, Modi touched upon various topics including demonetisation, black money and corruption and promised to take India ahead ""with greater speed"". He hoped the campaign against Triple Talaq would succeed.

CONGRESS CALLS IT HOLLOW PROMISES

Immediately after the prime minister finished his address, Congress accused him of making false promises. The Congress leadership hoped that rather than making empty promises, PM Modi should have given an account of the promises that had been fulfilled in the past three years.

On the eve of Independence Day, the party also hoped that Modi would talk about the state of the economy, the sharp decline in investment and loss of jobs in the country.

Senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said that when the prime minister addresses the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort tomorrow, he should refrain from making more tall promises and false and hollow claims about the achievements of his government.

""We request and advise the prime minister to give an account of how many promises that he made to people of the country in the last three years have been fulfilled. How many jobs has this government created and how many jobs have been lost. And if jobs have not been created, who should we hold responsible,"" Sharma said.

**The logic of India’s response to China** 

 ______ 
India remains the last nation standing—a stumbling block in China’s drive for domination of the Indo-Pacific. Photo: AFP

Amid the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in Doklam area in the Sikkim sector, national security adviser Ajit Doval’s visit to China has come and gone. Nothing much has changed on the ground. Beijing continues to harangue and wage its psychological warfare, sometimes by reminding India of 1962 and sometimes by suggesting that countermeasures from Beijing would be unavoidable if the Narendra Modi government continues to ignore the Chinese warnings. Chinese officials even went to the extent of informing a visiting Indian media delegation that Bhutan has conveyed to Beijing through diplomatic channels that the area of the standoff is not its territory though, of course, no evidence for this claim was provided. Thimphu later denied these claims.

China is also provoking India by asking what New Delhi would do if it “enters” Kalapani region in Uttarakhand or at some place in Kashmir. This is the first time that the issue of Kashmir has been raked up by China at the official level. “The Indian side has also many tri-junctions. What if we use the same excuse and enter the Kalapani region between China, India and Nepal or even into the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan,” Wang Wenli, deputy director general of the boundary and ocean affairs of China’s ministry of foreign affairs, said.

This comes after minister of external affairs Sushma Swaraj’s assertion in Parliament a few days back that war was not a solution and India would resolve the border standoff with China through dialogue. But she also made it clear that India’s reasonableness shouldn’t be mistaken for weakness. “Just because we want to have friendly relations with our neighbours, they shouldn’t cross the line. India always wanted smooth relations with China. But the alignment of boundaries involving India, China and Bhutan has to always be finalized in consultation with all three countries,” she said, underscoring New Delhi’s resolve not to be cowed down by Beijing’s relentless high-pitched campaign.

This crisis between China and India is different from other such episodes in the past but what makes it unique in recent memory is New Delhi’s determination so far not to concede the standoff on China’s terms. Beijing has tried everything. It has used its media to bully India; it has threatened India officially; it has used colonial era records selectively; it has tried to rally world public opinion. But India has not budged.

And that, in essence, foreshadows the future of the global order. Underlying all this petulance about boundaries and territories, behind all this façade of sovereignty, the Sino-India standoff in Doklam is about whether the future of Asia will be one with China as the dominant actor, dictating the terms of acceptable behaviour to other nations or whether the future of Asia will be a multipolar one in the real sense of the term. India has decided to stand its ground because there is far too much at stake in responding to Chinese bullying.

China talks of a multipolar world order, but in reality, it has always desired a unipolar Asia. Its assertiveness in staking its maritime territorial claims in recent years might have convinced it that there is no real opposition to it in the region and beyond. The West is too preoccupied with its own internal challenges to pose any serious problems in China’s way. And the regional states are too weak to do anything about Chinese belligerence.

The Asean (Association of South-East Asian Nations) turned out to be a paper tiger when it came to the crunch. China’s divide and rule policy has fractured any sense of unity in South-East Asia. A rather weak and ineffective negotiating framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea was recently adopted by Asean under Chinese pressure, reflecting the challenges being faced by the larger Indo-Pacific at a time when the US remains distracted and lacks a clear Asia policy under Donald Trump.

And so, India remains the last nation standing, a stumbling block in China’s drive for domination of the Indo-Pacific. Already, the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative has made China central to the evolving global economic order. Even when nations realize the folly of their joining this mega connectivity initiative, they see no real alternative.

New Delhi is the sole major power that has decided to publicly oppose Xi Jinping’s vanity project. The other major power centres remain constrained in their policy responses to China. Japan has domestic political and legal constraints despite Shinzo Abe’s proactive foreign policy. Australia’s economic future is so deeply intertwined with China’s that its elites are today having to debate the choice between the US and China.

The Modi government, in contrast, has been robust in its response to China’s rise. It quickly realized that China remains determined to pursue a unilateral foreign policy and Indian interests will suffer if New Delhi does not make a change in its foreign policy behaviour. While a section of the Indian elites continues to believe that India can shape Chinese behaviour by its policies, policymakers have been confronting the consequences of China’s growing capabilities in multiple ways. Though a tad late, New Delhi has been focusing on building its border infrastructure and has been active in trying to reach out to other like-minded powers in the region such as Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam to shape a favourable balance of power in the region.

The Doklam standoff, therefore, comes at an inflection point in India’s relations with China. For India, there is only one option: standing up to China resolutely to protect its core interests. Otherwise, it will have to acquiesce in shaping a China-centric Indo-Pacific. And for most Indians, that clearly is not an option even worth thinking about.

**GST rollout improves business efficiency by 30%: PM Narendra Modi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The abolition of inter-state check posts after the implementation of GST has reduced time for movement of goods by 30 per cent and saved thousands of crores of rupees, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today.

The Goods and Services Tax, which unified more than a dozen central and state levies, is a result of cooperative federalism and its smooth rollout from July 1 has increased efficiencies of business, he said.

Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of 71st Independence Day, Modi said technology has made the rollout smooth in a short span on time.

""Trucks (carrying goods) are saving 30 per cent (travel) time post GST as check posts have been removed. This has helped save thousands of crores of rupees and more importantly time,"" he said.

Business efficiency, he said, has increased. ""Efficiency has increased in transport sector by 30 per cent and because of GST such a big change has happened,"" he said.

The biggest tax reform since Independence, GST was rolled out from July 1. The new indirect tax regime has subsumed over a dozen state and central levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT, and has replaced them with four tier tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent for goods and services across the country.

GST has removed inter-state barriers to convert India into a single market where goods and services can flow seamlessly.

State border check posts scrutinised material and location-based tax compliance, resulting in delays in delivery of goods and cause environment pollution as trucks queue up for clearance.

Modi said crores of people are behind the success of GST and the implementation of the new indirect tax regime is an example of the benefits that can be reaped if there is cooperative federalism in place between the Centre and states.

""Technology is a miracle. Some find it astonishing that GST has been rolled out in such a vast country in such short span of time,"" he said.

He said in initiatives like GST, ease of doing business and cleanliness drive, the Centre and states have worked shoulder to shoulder to make them a success. He said the steps taken by the government will benefit the country and with GST the country will benefit.

Modi said there was a time when the Centre and states used to fight over allocation of urea and kerosene.

The Central government, he said, had a ""big brother"" approach towards the states. But all this is a thing of past with increased urea production in last three years and alternate LPG and natural gas usage cutting down kerosene demand, he said.

""Since I have myself been a Chief Minister for long, I know that states are important for the growth of a country. I understand the importance of chief ministers and state governments.

""And that is why we focused on cooperative federalism and now competitive cooperative federalism. And now we are taking all decision together,"" Modi said. JD ANZ SA

**18 lakh people, Rs 1.75 lakh crore deposits under scrutiny: PM Narendra Modi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Vowing to continue crackdown on the black money , Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said Rs 1.75 lakh crore deposits in banks post note-ban as well as 18 lakh people with income beyond known means are under scrutiny.Addressing the nation on the 71st Independence Day, he said demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes last November led to at least Rs 2 lakh crore of undeclared income coming into the banking system.Besides, he said, it led to doubling of income tax filers to 56 lakh and detection of over 3 lakh 'shell' or paper companies that were used for money laundering.After withdrawing the legal tender status of high denomination currency, the government had given 50-day window for depositing the junked currency in bank accounts. Note ban , according to independent research, helped bring Rs 3 lakh crore of unaccounted wealth into the banking system, Modi said in his fourth address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.Modi, who devoted biggest chunk of his nearly an hour long speech to black money, said that out of the money deposited in banks post note ban, over Rs 1.75 lakh crore is under scrutiny. ""More than Rs 2 lakh crore black money has reached banks and now people depositing such money are being made to answer questions.""The demonetisation move, he said, has checked generation of new black money.""We will continue our fight against black money and corruption. And slowly by using technology and connecting (biometric identification) Aadhaar (with several items including bank accounts and income tax return filing) we have made successful efforts,"" he added.The government has in a short span of time confiscated more than Rs 800 crore of benami properties or assets owned in fictitious and proxy names, he said.Those who have looted the nation, and the poor, are not able to sleep peacefully, and honesty is being celebrated today, he said, asserting that ""the fight against black money will continue"".""The result of this has been that this year, the new tax payers (filing returns) has more than doubled to 56 lakh. Last year this was 22 lakh. This is the result of fight against black money,"" he said.Modi, who rode to power in 2014 on promise to eliminate black money, said the crackdown on ill-gotten wealth will continue.""More than 18 lakh people have been identified whose income is more than their declared wealth,"" he said. ""And they have to answer questions on how they accumulated such wealth.""Of the 18 lakh, 4.5 lakh people have come out in open and are seeking to amend their ""mistakes"", he said, adding that one lakh of them had not paid income tax ever in the past.Stating that technology will help bring about transparency, he encouraged people to further promote digital transactions.Recalling the steps taken by his government to unearth unaccounted and untaxed wealth, he said black money of over Rs 1.25 lakh crore has been detected in last three years which people were compelled to surrender.Demonetisation, he said, was a step in that direction which achieved great success.The move forced ""the black money which was hidden to be brought to mainstream. Our effort was to get money into banks and make it a part of formal economy and we have done it successfully"", he said.Modi said that in a nation where closure of a couple of companies would lead to debates on destruction of economy, more than 1.75 lakh shell companies have been shut.Black money holders hid their wealth behind the veils of shell companies, he said. ""After data mining post demonetisation, we have found 3 lakh such companies which are only shell companies.""Shell companies are non-trading firms used as a vehicle for various financial manoeuvres to avoid paying taxes.""You will be surprised to know that there are 400 shell companies operating from same address. There was no enquiry and all of it was going on in connivance (between tax evaders and officials). And for this, I embarked on a fight against black money and corruption,"" he said.Note ban, he said, got money into banks, which are now lowering interest rates.Common man is getting money. ""Bank are lending to poor at lower interest rates. This is all working to boost the country's economy,"" he said.Modi stressed on digital payments to move towards less cash economy saying there has been 34 per cent increase in digital payments in last one year.Modi said the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), that subsumed over a dozen central and state levies to weave India into one market, has been smooth.""GST has shown the spirit of cooperative federalism. The nation has come together to support GST and the role of technology has also helped,"" he said.Removal of check posts after implementation of GST has cut time for transporting goods by 30 per cent, he said.The Prime Minister said for his government, good governance is about speed and simplification of processes.""Our fight against corruption and black money will continue. We are working to bring transparency using technology,"" he said. ""We are fighting corruption - for the bright future of India and the wellbeing of our people.""People responsible for ""loot"" of national wealth will have to give answers, he said. ""Our fight against corruption and black money will continue.""Modi appreciated the efforts of farmers and agriculture scientists for record crop production this year.He said the government procured 16 lakh tonnes of pulses this year, far in excess of the previous years.He said the changing nature of technology is resulting in the requirement of different skill-sets for employment and the youth is being nurtured to become job-creators, and not job- seekers.""We are taking the nation on a new track (of development) and are moving ahead with speed,"" he said, adding that the government was devoting significant attention to eastern states of Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha and North East.""These parts have to grow further,"" he said.Stating that the government has taken India on new tracks of development, without slackening pace, Modi said he wants to create an India where poor have a concrete houses, electricity and water.""An India where farmer does not have any worry and sleeps peacefully. An India where farmer gets double of what he sows.""

DeMo was just a stupid hair-brained scheme that some uneducated quacks like ArthKranti suggested and he listened to. It was a complete economic disaster that killed people in the process and hurt India's economy.     
If Modi wanted to root out corruption for real, he need not look further than the Parliament to start his efforts. The politicians, bureaucrats and big corporations of the country are the reason for the corruption. The top 1% that hold nearly 60% of the country's wealth. That is where you find the black money, not in the homes of the 50% people who can barely make ends meet. Why is this Dhongi Baba Ramdev still strutting around, expanding his business empire? Why there have been no raids on him? He imports goods from China, some of which are unfit for human consumption and sells them as pure and best while slamming other brands. When anyone raises voice against him, everyone goes up in arms that they are a corporate shill and want to prevent indigenous companies. I am all for MAke in India. Hell, I have been vehemently boycotting Made in China products because they hurt our nation, are low quality, toxic and nondurable products. I support local businesses vs MN marts. That is exactly why people like Ramdev should be called out for selling poison to people. But, oh no, being one of the most heavy handed donors to BJP, the govt. won't touch him.      

Modi not only demonetised the country, he also demoralised it. He has demoralised its people, its army, its healthcare system, its entrepreneurs, its farmers and small businesses and sucked up to foreign investors and big corporations. As one satire artist astutely remarked - ""DeMo was like an attempt to drain the pond to kill the alligator. Nothing happened to the alligator but all the fish died!""

All Modi's black money raids have been on opposition party members and their supporters to crush opposition so he could become the sole power and an authoritarian. Black money and corruption are tools he uses to serve personal agendas.      

DeMo was a financial terrorist attack on Indian population. It was not glorious, did not have any good intentions and was one of the darkest times for India in the modern years.     
Modi may have done some good things, but the more he sings about DeMo, the worse he makes himself appear. I know congress was horrible, but Modi isn't much better. He is a bull wrecking the chinaware shop and we are the chinaware.",2017-08-15 16:51:48

REUTERS/Carlos Barria

India and the United States pledged to maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region through a two-by-two ministerial dialogue, the White House said. President Donald Trump had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of India’s independence day, news agency PTI reported.

“The leaders resolved to enhance peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific region by establishing a new two-by-two ministerial dialogue that will elevate their strategic consultations,” the White House said.

Trump was also optimistic about the energy relations between the two countries as the first-ever shipment of American crude oil to India from Texas is scheduled to begin this month. In a readout of the phone conversation between the two leaders, the White House said Trump promised PM Modi that the United States would continue to be a reliable energy supplier.

The White House added that PM Modi thanked President Trump in the manner in which the latter was able to unite the world against North Korea, the country headed by Kim Jong-un which has threatened to attack the US with its nuclear missiles. Trump, in response, had warned that military solutions were locked in place if North Korea were to harm the citizens of US.

Later this year, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is scheduled to lead a delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad.

**Violence by cow vigilantes increased in India in 2016: US** 

 ______ 
The report released by secretary of state Rex Tillerson, said there were reports of religiously motivated killings, assaults, riots, discrimination, vandalism, and actions restricting the right of individuals to practice their religious beliefs and proselytize. Photo: AP

Washington: There was an increase in violent incidents by cow protection groups mostly against Muslims in India in the year 2016, an official US report on international religious freedom said on Tuesday, noting that authorities often “failed” to prosecute cow vigilantes.

The report, the first under the Trump Administration, released by secretary of state Rex Tillerson, said members of the civil society expressed concerns that under the BJP government religious minority communities felt vulnerable due to Hindu nationalist groups engaging in violence against non- Hindu individuals and places of worship.

“There were reports of religiously motivated killings, assaults, riots, discrimination, vandalism, and actions restricting the right of individuals to practice their religious beliefs and proselytize,” the state department said in its annual report, which does a country wise review of the religious freedom in the year 2016.

It said that there was an increase in violent incidents by cow protection groups against mostly Muslims, including killings, mob violence, assaults, and intimidation.

“Hindus threatened and assaulted Muslims and Christians and destroyed their property,” said the Congressional-mandated 2016 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom.

Listing out some of the anti-minorities incidents by cow protection groups, the report said that the authorities often “failed” to prosecute violence by cow protection groups against persons, mostly Muslims, suspected of slaughtering or illegally transporting cows or trading in or consuming beef.

In his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said violence in the name of faith is “not acceptable” and described casteism and communalism as “poison” for the country.

His comments assume significance in the backdrop of incidents of lynchings by cow vigilantes.

Quoting the Evangelical Fellowship of India (EFI), the US report said there were over 300 incidents of abuse targeting Christians during the year, compared with 177 in 2015.

In its report, the State Department notes that the Supreme Court was considering a case challenging the constitutionality of the Islamic practice of instantaneous “triple talaq” divorce; the federal government filed a brief in support of the challenge.

“During his speech at Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh on 24 October, Prime Minister Modi stated there should be no discrimination against women on the basis of religion and the government had the responsibility to protect Muslim women’s constitutional rights,” it said.

Muslim community leaders characterized government actions as interfering in their religious life and maintained that religious decisions should remain the exclusive domain of religious communities, it added.

“Religious minority communities stated that, while the national government sometimes spoke out against incidents of violence, local political leaders often did not, which left victims and minority religious communities feeling vulnerable,” the report added. PTI

**PM's 'Competitive Cooperative Federalism' brilliant idea: Narayana Murthy** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy today termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's idea of ""Competitive Cooperative Federalism"" as brilliant.""Whenever the Prime Minister speaks he brings out lots of wisdom. I am so happy that he has used 'competitive cooperative federalism'. It is a brilliant idea,"" Murthy said on the sidelines of inauguration of Synergetic Security operation Centre of SISA here.Addressing the nation on India's 71st Independence Day earlier this morning, Modi had said: ""Since I have myself been a Chief Minister for long, I know that states are important for the growth of a country. I understand the importance of chief ministers and state governments.""And that is why we focused on cooperative federalism and now competitive cooperative federalism. And now we are taking all decision together.""Appreciating the comment, Murthy said the competitive aspect of the slogan would make states compete with each other to attract investors and entrepreneurs and thereby create more jobs.He said there are areas where states would have to cooperate with the federal government in terms of fighting illiteracy in education, healthcare and nutrition.Stating that there are many problems in the country, he said every state should cooperate fully with the union government to solve them as it was not fair to blame the Centre alone to find solutions.""There are areas where states can compete each other and areas where they can cooperate with each other,"" Murthy said.Asked how he measured the success of the demonetisation exercise and that of GST, Murthy said the Union government needs to be congratulated on both fronts as demonetisation has unearthed a lot of black money and GST would start yielding benefits to businessmen and government going forward.""Demonetisation has removed a lot of black money. There is no doubt the Prime Minister himself said that somewhere around Rs 1.25 lakh crore of black money has been unearthed and removed. I think this is something we should all congratulate the government,"" he said.""GST is a mechanism wherein there is less and less hassle for business people and therefore it should be welcomed. And I believe GST will start yielding tremendous benefits to business people as well as to the government going forward,"" he said.Asked as to how good was the action taken on shell companies post demonetisation, Murthy congratulated Modi as well as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, saying it was a step in the right direction, which would help the Indian economy.On what India should look forward to achieve by the next Independence Day, Murthy said he looks at it in a slightly different way.""If we can create an India where the poorest child in the remotest part of the country has access to decent education; decent healthcare; decent nutrition and decent shelter, and has the confidence that society will enhance opportunities for that child to become better economically and socially...all of that we should try to achieve.""

**Kashmir needs hugs, neither abuse nor bullets: PM Modi in Independence Day speech** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged a more conciliatory approach towards troubled Kashmir on Tuesday, saying problems can be solved by “embracing” the people rather than resorting to abuse or bullets.

Modi’s comment as part of his Independence Day speech signals a possible shift in his policy towards Kashmir, where the government has been pursuing a tough line against a surge in street violence that has killed about 100 people over the past year.

“I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people,” Modi said from the ramparts of the 17th century Red Fort.

“The problem will be solved neither by abuse nor bullets - it will be solved by embracing all Kashmiris… And we are moving forward with this resolve.”

In his 57-minute speech, the shortest of his four Independence Day addresses, the Prime Minister also enumerated his government’s efforts at fighting corruption, condemned the use of violence in the name of faith, extolled the country’s defence capabilities and outlined his vision of a new India.

The speech was silent on foreign policy with no mention of ties with either Pakistan or China with which New Delhi has been involved in a tense border standoff for almost two months along a disputed stretch in Bhutan. In last year’s speech, Modi took a veiled dig at Pakistan, mentioning Balochistan and Gilgit where Pakistani military has been accused of using excessive force.

Modi’s Tuesday speech drew criticism from opposition Congress which termed it as “most disappointing” and an “account of the failure of the government”. Party spokesman Anand Sharma also accused Modi of trivialising the recent deaths of more than 60 children in a hospital in Gorakhpur by equating them with natural calamities.

In Kashmir, the speech was welcomed cautiously. Moderate separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said the region’s problems could be solved if “humanism and justice” replaced bullets and abuses.

In a series of tweets, former state chief minister Omar Abdullah said: “The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We look forward to being embraced in the warm grip of understanding, acceptance &amp; respect.

“PM Modi’s words for Kashmir have been very well received by people here but everyone here is weary of yet more talk &amp; no concrete action.”

Modi also spoke of restoring Kashmir to “the paradise that it was” but made it clear that his government will not go soft on terrorists.

He also used the occasion to condemn communal and caste-related violence at a time when the country has seen a spike in deadly attacks by self-styled cow protection groups.

“Sometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end up destroying the social fabric… The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the country,” he said.

Modi used the speech to urge people to embrace a “New India” where “people are not driven by the system, rather the system is driven by the people”.

“Together we will build such an India which will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism,” he said.

“Together we will build such an India where nobody will compromise with corruption and nepotism… an India which will be clean and healthy.”

**Tripura Chief Minister Alleges Doordarshan, AIR Refused To Broadcast His Independence-Day Speech** 

 ______ 
Manik Sarkar's speech was supposed to be broadcast today by Doordarshan and
AIR in Tripura.

**Agartala/New Delhi: **

Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar today alleged that Doordarshan and All
India Radio (AIR) refused to broadcast his Independence Day address unless he
""reshaped"" it and termed it as an ""undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant
step"".

There was no immediate reaction from the Prasar Bharati, which runs
Doordarshan and All India Radio.

A Tripura government press statement alleged that Doordarshan and AIR had
recorded Sarkar's speech on August 12.

Yesterday at 7 pm, the Chief Minister's office was informed through a letter
that his speech would not be broadcast unless he ""reshaped it"".

The letter purportedly said, ""The message of the Chief Minister was closely
examined by competent authority. In view of the sanctity of the occasion, the
broadcast code and responsibility of the public broadcaster it is not possible
to telecast it in the present format.""

""However, Doordarshan/Prasar Bharati will be happy if the chief minister
agrees to reshape the content making it suitable to the solemnity of the
occasion and sentiment of the people,"" it purportedly said.

The CMO statement claimed, ""The chief minister clearly stated that he would
not change a single word and described it as unprecedented, undemocratic,
autocratic and intolerant step.""

Sarkar's speech was supposed to be broadcast today by Doordarshan and AIR in
Tripura.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said Doordarshan was ""not the private
property"" of the BJP-RSS and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of
""instructing his cronies to black out voices"" of the opposition, including
that of an elected chief minister.

In a statement, the CPI-M Politburo said it ""strongly condemns the refusal by
the Doordarshan and All India Radio to broadcast the customary Independence
Day address of Sarkar"".

""The Doordarshan and All India Radio had recorded his speech for the occasion.
However, they subsequently informed him that the speech cannot be carried as
it is and asked him to 'reshape' it,"" it said.

The party demanded action against those responsible for ""prohibiting"" the
broadcast.

""This is a gross infringement on the right of a chief minister to address the
people of his state on Independence Day. This act is reminiscent of the
Emergency days and goes beyond as it seeks to gag the elected Chief Minister
of a state. The central government is trampling upon the autonomy of
Doordarshan/AIR and Prasar Bharati by such acts of censorship,"" the statement
said.

""Doordarshan Refuses to Broadcast Tripura CM Manik Sarkar's Speech. Is this
the Cooperative Federalism that PM Modi Talks About? Shame!"" the CPI (M)'s
official Twitter handle said.

Tagging the tweet, Yechury hit out at the central government saying the
channel's alleged refusal to air Sarkar's speech was ""illegal"".

""PM can pay homilies to cooperative federalism while instructing his cronies
to black out voices of the Opposition, including an elected CM.

""If this isn't authoritarianism &amp;amp; undeclared Emergency, what is? This will
be fought back by the CPM, people of Tripura and all our citizens,"" the
Marxist leader tweeted.

 ______ 
NOIDA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considered invincible in the 2019 Lok Sabha election since Bihar CM Nitish Kumar shifted towards BJP and formed government, but a Noida man claims himself as a strong candidate against the prime minister in the election.Thirty-six-year-old Vinod Pawar claims some astrologer has predicted him as a strong prime ministerial candidate and he is taking this seriously. He has also made some posters stationing himself against prime minister Narendra Modi as rival candidate. Pawar is a graduate in chemistry and runs a coaching centre in Noida's Sector 50.""The country is facing severe economic crisis. The labourers are not getting paid the minimum wages. There is tension at the borders. There are so many issues that need to be addressed. I want to become a prime minister to lead the nation to economic growth and prosperity,"" he told TOI.This is the second time Pawar is trying his luck in politics. In January 2017, he had filed nomination papers for MLA candidate from Noida assembly seat and declared Russian President Vladimir Putin as a friend and Mahatma Gandhi, along with several other freedom fighters and leaders, as his prastavaks (introducers). His political journey was, however, cut short with the cancellation of his candidature for not providing substantial information.Besides Gandhi, he had named Swami Vivekananda, Martin Luther King Junior, B R Ambedkar, APJ Abdul Kalam, Nelson Mandela, Subhash Chandra Bose, Gautam Buddha, Abraham Lincoln and others as 'prastavaks'. Whereas, as per the rule, an independent candidate needs signatures of 10 'prastavaks' on the affidavit and they must also be voters in the same constituency.Pawar reiterated his stand on prastavaks in nomination papers. ""Why do I name local people as prastavaks, when I have freedom fighters and other scholars to name,"" he said.

**People of India stand shoulder to shoulder with Gorakhpur hospital tragedy victims: PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Nearly 70 patients, including infants, have died at a Gorakhpur hospital since Aug 7.

2 Many of these deaths were alleged to have been caused by shortage of oxygen.

3 PMO earlier said that Modi was constantly monitoring the situation in Gorakhpur.

In his fourth Independence Day speech from the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today referred to the Gorakhpur hospital deaths, including those of infants, and said that the sympathies of 125 crore people of the country were with the kin of the victims.

""Sometimes, natural calamities become a very big challenge. Good rains contribute hugely to the prosperity of a nation. But due to climate change, sometimes, these natural calamities bring distress. A few days ago, in many parts of the country, natural disasters took place. A few days back, at a hospital, our innocent children died. In this entire time of distress and sadness, sympathies of 125 crore people of the country are with them,"" he said.

Nearly 70 patients, including infants, have died at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur since August 7 as the authorities grappled with the situation in the aftermath of the tragedy which continued to unfold.

Many of these deaths were alleged to have been caused by shortage of oxygen, a claim dismissed by the state government, which has ordered an inquiry by the chief secretary and suspended the principal of the hospital, Rajiv Mishra.

WILL DO EVERYTHING TO HELP PEOPLE IN DISTRESS: PM

""I assure my countrymen, during this time of distress, with utmost sensitivity, for the betterment and security of people, we will leave no stone unturned to extend help,"" Modi said.

He also tweeted, ""People of India stand shoulder to shoulder with those affected due to natural disasters &amp; the tragedy in Gorakhpur.""

The Prime Minister's Office had earlier said that Modi was constantly monitoring the situation in Gorakhpur and was in touch with central and state authorities.

**Tamil Nadu: Two die in Ambur due to absence of doctors in hospital** 

 ______ 
The Ambur Government Hospital in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, has been facing lack of medical staff for a while now. The residents and activists claim to have raised the issue with the authorities but no progress has been made as yet.

On August 13, two patients were brought to the hospital's emergency ward. Rajkumar, a cab driver, met with an accident on Chennai-Bengaluru road and was rushed to the hospital. However, he was made to wait as there was no doctor available to attend him. Meanwhile, a young girl named Vaishnavi, was also rushed into the emergency ward after she complained of severe chest pain.

Unfortunately, there was only one doctor available at the hospital then.

Vaishnavi and Rajkumar died before the doctor could attend them. Outraged by the loss of their loved ones, the family members of the deceased blocked the hospital, causing panic among other patients.

""Rajkumar was made to wait for more than 2 hours, and Vaishnavi was left unattended for an hour. There was no one to provide them breathing equipment. That's the reason we are protesting here"", said Kumaran, a resident of Aambur.

As a matter of fact, the authorities also accepted their fault in the case. ""Due to absence of the doctor, a patient involved in a road accident had died. We'll definitely take action in the matter. The child was already suffering from a heart ailment and she was brought in a critical condition."", explained Shanti, Assistant Director. She also stated that the government is trying to compensate for the lack of staff by outsourcing and the matter should be resolved within a month.

Shanti said, as of now four doctors are present and one will visit every week from Thirupathur and Gudiyatham.

Sources claim that the hospital was supposed to have 16 doctors to handle the patient flow.

However, Health Minister Vijayabhaskar has assured that there are enough doctors and staff present in all the hospitals of Tamil Nadu.

Jawaharlal Nehru to Narendra Modi, Jyoti Basu to NT Rama Rao, Sheikh Abdullah to Jagjivan Ram: Journalist Vir Sanghvi picks 70 politicians who shaped the evolution of modern India. ( Read how this list was curated )

Illustrations by Mohit Suneja.

Note from Vir Sanghvi on how he curated the list

Is it possible to pick just 70 people and say that they were the most influential politicians in the seven decades of our Independence?

Probably not. But I’ve given it a shot anyway, drawing up a list that I regard as fair and comprehensive but which others may well find contentious or controversial. But then, one man’s hero is often another man’s nonentity.

Not that this list is packed only with heroes. My criteria were simple: restrict the list to politicians who played a major role in the post-Independence period (so that ruled out Gandhiji, Netaji and many others) and then assess their influence and legacies. So, there are some villains here, people who did damage to India but who belong on this list because that damage was so great that we still suffer its consequences.

There are some surprising omissions. Many big-name politicians from the last two decades are not listed because I do not believe they left any legacy or changed India in any significant sense. And there is one entry that breaks my own rules. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was not really a politician. But he changed our view of the Presidency so radically that I couldn’t possibly have left him out.

As for the rest, well, all such lists are subjective. So, go ahead and disagree!

UCC may sound like an 'Ideal utopian' chutiyapa that Modi has been promising for 3 years. One nation, One law, One tax. India is dozen nations within itself that can merrily coexist. No need to mess with it. If only Indian institutions were strong and independent, probably UCC might have been success. This will just be a tool for majority assertion on minority.

UCC may rile muslims, sikhs and other minorities. In an age where India should focus on labour reforms, job creation, making Indian youngsters skilled to take work - UCC is a tool from govt to escape from it's apparent failures. You would not want internal disturbances and business turning away from India at the cost of UCC.

However, there are unrecognised institutions which preside over muslim policy matters as division of property, marriage etc - they run dispute resolution 'courts' where in disputes arising out of marriage (muslims call it nikah), property division or any trivial matter is resolved - quickly and at nominal costs (50,100 Rupees)

**Why ATMs, once a symbol of liberalised economy, are fast losing importance** 

 ______ 
As one walks into the boardroom of Hitachi Payment Services located in the posh technology hub of Mumbai suburb Goregaon, there’s a board hanging in a corner which reads ‘MoneySpot,’ the brand name under which it operates the white label cash dispensing business in India. It was supposed to be a money spinner, but after many years into the business, nearly 700 ‘MoneySpot’ outlets, or half its total, have vanished in the past year.The business of automated teller machines (ATMs), which was marketed as ‘Any Time Money’ to convey its convenience, is staring at a crisis. What was once thought to be a vital component of the banking industry, is now being relegated to the margins. “A lot of people have been talking about ATMs, but the fact is—as we move towards digital, we are examining ATM transactions for the banking system and even for us, (we see it) going down,” says Aditya Puri, chief executive of HDFC Bank , which became the most valuable bank by building its customer reach through ATMs in the early days.The number of ATMs, which nearly doubled between 2012 (around one lakh) and 2015, is stagnating around 2 lakh and has hardly shown any growth in the past six months. The number of debit card transactions on ATMs has collapsed to an average of 660 million a month from over 750 million before demonetisation.From around eight white label operators, which are non-banking institutions deploying ATMs, only three have put up a reasonable number of machines aggregating around 10,000. Those active among them are loss-making.The ATM industry , just like any other, is facing its moment of truth. While former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker declared ATMs as the only useful innovation of the financial services industry at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, these could be at the threshold of slowly becoming history.In India, ATMs are not only challenged by technological developments in payments and smartphones, but also by regulatory issues, squabbling between banks on how to split the cost and demonetisation--which changed the paradigm. “Customers are doing more and more transactions digitally,” says Rajiv Anand, executive director at Axis Bank. “An interesting statistic for us is that the value of transactions that we are doing on our mobile phones is now more than the value of transactions we are doing on the ATMs.”The widening reach of smartphones and point-ofsale (PoS) terminals is making cash less relevant.The number of PoS terminals jumped to 2.7 million in June from 1.5 million in November last year. Mobile banking transactions surged to 390 million in 2015-16 from 53 million in 2012-13, data from the regulator shows. The advent of wallets such as Paytm, which can be used to pay from bubble gums to television sets, has made the younger generation skip cash payments.The lowering of interchange fee in 2012-13, the fee X bank pays to Y bank for its customers using the ATM of Y bank, poured cold water on the profitability of ATMs. The interchange fee was brought down to Rs 15 per transaction from Rs 18. “At various forums these concerns have been raised, starting from the department of financial services to the Reserve Bank and even the Indian Banks’ Association, but no decision on revising the rates has been taken yet,” says Navroze Dastur, managing director for India and South Asia at NCR Corporation, the largest deployer of ATMs in India.An ATM was first deployed at a Barclays Bank branch in London and it reached India in 1987. This was the time when foreign banks were using them to quickly expand their footprint in India. Like most new gadgets, it was for the rich and powerful in the beginning.In a tightly regulated banking market like India, where foreign banks are not permitted to open branches freely, ATMs became a tool to reach out to customers.When liberalisation gave birth to banks such as HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank (erstwhile UTI Bank), they copied global banks to acquire customers quickly. But the biggest growth phase came when state-run banks realised that without ATMs their customers were moving to rivals and interchange fee had become a drain.“From product differentiation, customer acquisition became the next pillar for the ATM industry,” says Loney Antony, managing director of Hitachi Payment Services. “In the period between 1997 and 1998, PSBs were thinking that a human teller was cheaper than a machine. Then they migrated to the strategy around retention of customers.” When the cost of installing ATMs soared, came the concept of shared services between banks. Then emerged the pay per use model, where the ATM companies said they will be setting up the ATM point, installing the machine and managing them, but the branding will be of the bank which will pay on per use basis. The industry referred to it as the ‘brown label model’.No other policy maker gave the kind of impetus to the ATM industry the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi did with his Jan Dhan programme, where every household was provided with a bank account and a RuPay debit card.That pushed the total number of debit cards in the system to more than 550 million in 2014-15 from 331 million in 2012-13, thereby increasing the chance of card swipes at ATMs.The government’s Jan Dhan programme, which was a gift turned out to be a short-term celebration as the move towards digitisation robbed the ATM industry of its business. The launch of applications like BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money), licensing of new set of niche banks like payments banks and their strategy of going digital first, reduced ATMs’ relevance.“Our expansion of ATMs is a little slow,” says K Venkataraman, chief executive at Karur Vysya Bank. “The demand for ATMs in the long run, we expect, could be less as people shift more to the digital channels and cash usage may be coming down.’’But all may not be lost as yet. The industry is evolving business models where it could survive by generating more out of cash recycling machines.Cash recyclers are the latest innovation to happen to the ATM industry. These machines can both accept and dispense cash. Recyclers do have an advantage of being a multipurpose machine, but the problem is that they hardly find the right balance between deposits and withdrawals.“There is no perfect balancing between the cash deployed and the cash withdrawn at these recyclers.Hence, even with recyclers the cash in transit companies will be needed,” said Ravi Goyal, managing director of AGS Transact Technologies, which deploys, installs and manages around 60,000 ATMs.Furthermore, the cost is prohibitive and that is forcing some manufacturers to set up facilities here.“Manufacturing in India can reduce the cost of these machines. Recyclers had started at Rs 15 to 20 lakh per machine, and this has come down to about Rs 7 lakh already,” says Antony of Hitachi.While price is a major concern, utilisation is also important. As State Bank of India’s chief operating officer Neeraj Vyas puts it, though they have around 250 in-touch branches, major activity reported there is still cash withdrawals, while other facilities are hardly being used. Bankers believe upgrade of these machines may not be sufficient enough for them to buy more of them.The ATM industry may be trying out many ways to remain a viable business, but it may well be the industry’s Walkman moment.

A row erupted in Tripura Tuesday when Chief Minister Manik Sarkar, who heads a Left Front government in the state, alleged that Doordarshan and All India Radio (AIR) refused to broadcast his Independence Day address unless he “reshaped” it.

A PTI report from Agartala quoted a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office: “The Chief Minister clearly stated that he would not change a single word and described it as unprecedented, undemocratic, autocratic and intolerant step.”

There was no immediate reaction from Prasar Bharati which runs Doordarshan and All India Radio.

The government statement alleged that Doordarshan and AIR had recorded Sarkar’s speech on August 12. At 7 pm Monday, the Chief Minister’s Office was informed via a letter that his speech would not be broadcast unless he “reshaped it”.

The letter purportedly said, “The message of the Chief Minister was closely examined by competent authority. In view of the sanctity of the occasion, the broadcast code and responsibility of the public broadcaster it is not possible to telecast it in the present format.”

“However, Doordarshan/Prasar Bharati will be happy if the Chief Minister agrees to reshape the content making it suitable to the solemnity of the occasion and sentiment of the people,” it said.

In New Delhi, the CPI-M politburo, in a statement, said it “strongly condemns the refusal by Doordarshan and All India Radio to broadcast the customary Independence Day address of Manik Sarkar”.

“Doordarshan and All India Radio had recorded his speech for the occasion. However, they subsequently informed him that the speech cannot be carried as it is and asked him to ‘reshape’ it,” it said.

Demanding action against those responsible for “prohibiting” the broadcast, the politburo said: “The Modi government should stop treating Prasar Bharati as a department of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.”

“This is a gross infringement on the right of a Chief Minister to address the people of his state on Independence Day. This act is reminiscent of the Emergency days and goes beyond as it seeks to gag the elected Chief Minister of a state. The central government is trampling upon the autonomy of Doordarshan/AIR and Prasar Bharati by such acts of censorship,” the statement said.

CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted “Doordarshan is not the private property of the BJP or the RSS. Its refusal to broadcast Tripura CM’s speech is undemocratic and illegal.”

156,"Hospital management, yes, but it could only do so much as to forward the requests and repeatedly request the government machinery for funds which it did.

Since he leads the government that did not pay the company even after a dozen reminders, Yogi, again yes. District administration, yes. Medical and financial administration of the government, yes.

Patna: RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Saturday demanded a CBI probe into an alleged embezzlement of over Rs 600 crore of government funds by a Bhagalpur-based NGO.

Senior Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar said the amount of fraudulent withdrawal of government funds has gone upto over Rs 600 crore so far in an investigation which was being carried out by the Economic Offence Unit (EOU).

File image of Lalu Prasad. AFPFile image of Lalu Prasad. AFP
On 10 August chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh had said that the amount of government funds that were embezzled by the NGO was around Rs 302.70 crore which might rise further.

Prasad told reporters that the figure of embezzeled funds had reached Rs 1000 crore and claimed that the money had also gone out of the state besides being invested in real estate and other places.

""One can not deny the money laundering aspect. There is the involvement of banks also and hence a state government agency is not capable of carrying out the probe in a fair manner,"" he claimed.

""So, we demand a CBI probe into the scam. Everything will become clear if the CBI carries out probes... We will also request the CAG to do a special audit in this connection. The Enforcement Directorate can also probe it,"" he said.

He also demanded the dismissal of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi from the government for his alleged links with the NGO's founder.

Sushil, who held portfolios of finance and commercial taxes for several years, had the responsibility of finance department without whose permission money cannot be transferred in any bank account, Prasad claimed.

He said it was his duty to put a check on the financial irregularities.

Prasad alleged that both chief minister Nitish Kumar and Sushil had links with the NGO that siphoned off over Rs 1,000 crore of government funds.

Showing a photograph to buttress his claim, the RJD chief claimed that Nitish was awarding the NGO's founder secretary in it.

Sushil and other BJP leaders such as Union minister Giriraj Singh, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, former Union ministers Shahnawaz Hussain and other leaders were also seen in the photograph as they had close links with the NGO, he claimed.

""Our party MLAs will also raise the issue in the upcoming Monsoon Session of state legislature (beginning August 21)... These funds have been transferred in violation of provisions of Bihar Treasury Code and Bihar Finance Rules and Sushil Modi has direct or indirect role in the embezzlement,"" he alleged.

Taking a jibe at Nitish Kumar's review meetings in various districts, the former Bihar CM asked, ""Is it an example of zero tolerance for corruption. Nitish has destroyed the state in the name of development.""

Countering the RJD chief's charges, JD(U) spokesman and MLC Niraj Kumar said allegations could not be made merely on basis of photographs, rather they must be supported by facts.

On Prasad's demand for a CBI probe, Kumar claimed he has suddenly developed a kind of affection for the central agency against which he had been spewing venom.

""The state police are capable of probing the matter. Let the facts come first and then he (Lalu) should react,"" he added.

Meanwhile, the SSP said three more FIRs were lodged in this connection yesterday.

Three separate FIRs have been lodged for embezzlement of funds of District Board, District Nazarat and Cooperative Department.

**Foreign bank executive in fray for RBI deputy governor post** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Nomura India's head of fixed income business Neeraj Gambhir is in contention for the job of an RBI deputy governor along with public sector bank chiefs such as Arun Tiwari and Rakesh Sharma, marking a rare instance of a foreign bank executive joining the long list of candidates.



RBI has four deputy governors — an economist, a commercial bank chief and two internal officers from the central bank. While three of the slots are already occupied, the tenure of S S Mundra recently ended, opening up a vacancy which the government is trying to fill.



If Gambhir clears the appointment process, it will end the domination that public sector bankers have had for years. It will also signal the Narendra Modi administration's strategy to rope in experts from outside as it tries to reinvigorate government departments as well as regulatory bodies.



For instance, the government opted for Urjit Patel (who worked in IDFC and Reliance) as RBI governor. Similarly, it has appointed a revenue service officer as the head of the Central Vigilance Commission, a job that was virtually reserved for officers from the IAS. It has also roped in an external expert in the sanitation department to push Swachh Bharat, instead of posting a regular bureaucrat.

**At 70, India regains the spirit of youth**

*By Jawed Ashraf*   

ON Aug 15, India is celebrating 70 years of independence. It is an important milestone for the world's largest democracy and the second-most populous nation on earth, not just because of the remarkable journey of seven decades, but also because of rekindled energy, enterprise, optimism, citizen participation and a national resolve usually associated with the start of a nation's journey. At 70, India is regaining the spirit of youth.
 
It is a moment to celebrate in Singapore, too, because of our ties of history and kinship, for Singapore's association with India's freedom struggle in Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's Indian National Army and Mahatma Gandhi's ashes immersed in the waters of Singapore.
 
Though India gained independence through a peaceful freedom struggle, our beginning was anything but peaceful. We had to unite a country fragmented into provinces and 572 princely states; heal a society bleeding from partition and burdened by historical disparities; and build an economy ravaged by colonialism.
 
The world, recovering from a horrific war, was slipping into a new division. The wounds of partition became a scar of neighbour's hostility. Over time, as the spectrum of challenges expanded from terrorism and claims on our territory to nuclear proliferation, our neighbourhood became a difficult one. We drew strength from the moral foundation of our freedom struggle and the guidance of an extraordinary constitution that had the vision and breadth to address every economic and social challenge. Scepticism of the world at our birth has turned into confidence about our future.
 
Over these seven decades, we have grown by about one billion people. We are federation of 29 states and seven union territories. We have 22 official languages, with different scripts, and hundreds of dialects. Our currency note can be read in 15 languages, besides English and Hindi. Our layered history, the diversity of our people and the pluralism of our civilisation are reflected in the infinite symbols of faiths, cultures, traditions and monuments. In the 2014 election to our Parliament, 553 million Indians cast their votes in the largest election in history.
 
We have built a strong and resilient economy that has become the world's fastest-growing major economy, the sixth-largest manufacturing sector, a leading producer of farm and dairy products and a key contributor to the evolution of the digital age. We have made enormous advances in science and technology, produced affordable medicines for the world and developed the most cost-effective space programme. We have developed the capacity to keep our nation secure, our seas free and our people safe. And, we have consistently fulfilled our international responsibility - strengthening global institutions, advancing international peace, seeking a fair deal for all nations and a sustainable future for our planet.
 
We take pride in our progress, but we are conscious of the many human and economic challenges that persist in the lives of millions of our citizens, visible across villages and cities of India. But, we draw confidence and inspiration from our journey so far; and from the high tide of hope and change sweeping through India. It draws its energy from the people of India, especially the 800 million-strong youth, and from the historic mandate received by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the National Democratic Alliance government in 2014.
 
The change has begun with the way the government works. Clean, transparent, efficient, responsive and policy-driven governance is as much a basic obligation to people as it a means to transform the economy. About 1,200 unnecessary laws have been repealed and hundreds of procedures eliminated. Federalism is no longer the fault line of centre-state relations, but the definition of a new partnership of Team India. Citizens now have the ease of trust, not the burden of proof and process. Businesses can focus their energy on enterprise, not on crossing hurdles. In a nation connected by mobile phones, Digital India is transforming the interface between government and citizens.
 
It has ushered in a new era of empowerment and inclusion that is turning dreams into realities. A unique biometric identity for 1.2 billion people, increasingly linked to government programmes and financial system; broadband network connecting 250,000 village councils; mobile phones in the hands of virtually everyone; and, governance migrating to digital space is expanding digitalisation rapidly. It has helped open nearly 300 million new bank accounts in the past three years; transform delivery of services and benefits; put banking, insurance and pensions within the reach of the poorest; and unleash entrepreneurship across the country.
 
It is helping farmers access information, inputs, credit, advisory, insurance and markets, as government expands investments on the agriculture sector, which still sustains livelihood for a majority, on a scale not seen in decades.
 
The mission of transforming India will be fulfilled when every citizen has access to a life of opportunity, dignity and basic needs. So, by the time India turns 75 in 2022, we will clean up India and address our social challenges; build 50 million affordable houses to put a roof over every head; reach power and connectivity to all our 600,000 villages; and, provide water and sanitation for every household, healthcare for every citizen, education for every girl child and skills for all our youth. With the pace of progress in the past three years, our goal is not a distant mirage, but well within our reach.
 
This is possible, because we have also accelerated our growth and made it more broadbased and inclusive. Not just the scale of numbers in India, but the determinants of politics, governance, policy, demography and resources tell us that India can and will sustain growth rates of 7-8 per cent long into the future.
 
Economic reforms cover both policy and processes and include 7,100 specific measures by the centre and the states in the past three years. They have made it easier to enter, start, operate and - if necessary - close businesses in India. Startups, small and medium companies and micro enterprises are also benefiting from infrastructure, and credit support and tax incentives
 
India's infrastructure is possibly expanding on the biggest scale in the world today. Highway expansion has gone up from 2km per day to 23km per day and will touch 40km per day by 2018. A total of 133km of rural roads are being added daily, and 2,000km of coastal roads and 1,000km of expressways are coming up.
 
Railways will invest US$125 billion in the next five years. High-speed rails, six new major ports and 18 new greenfield airports are being built. In the last three years, 76 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity - 21GW in solar and wind - have been added. As India urbanises rapidly, urban development - from smart cities, new townships and affordable housing - is the new locomotive of development. Our material progress will not be at the expense of our inheritance from nature. This commitment stems from our ancient heritage and our responsibility to the future.
 
India has always been at the crossroads of the world. We are now in a new phase of deeper global integration, and benefited from it. In turn, as the world's largest democracy and soon to be one of its largest economies, Indians also recognise their own responsibility to the world.
 
As in the past, we will defend ourselves with our strength, but we will engage the world with our values of openness, pluralism, dialogue and democracy. Our engagement will grow, not our claims on others. We will devote our energy to promote a more democratic and rule-based international order, in which all nations, small and large, can thrive as equal and sovereign nations.
 
We will work with others to keep our commons free and safe, and our nations secure from terrorism. We will share our resources, markets and prosperity with our neighbours. We will seek a sustainable future for our planet, as we have, in creating a new international solar alliance together with France and other partners.
 
Partnership with Singapore is among our closest, forged by human, cultural, political and economic bonds. The Asean region is our valued neighbour and strategic partner, admired for its role in fostering regional integration, stability and prosperity. Just as we treasure our own timeless links with the region, we are deeply committed to our common destiny. So, in whatever India does to advance its own development, or for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world, Asean countries, particularly Singapore, will always be integral to our endeavours.

With 13 districts of the state inundated, the death toll in Bihar has gone up to 56. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar took his second aerial survey of the flood-hit areas on Tuesday as the situation in the state worsened. According to Anirudh Kumar, special secretary in the state disaster management department, 69.81 lakh people are in the grip of floods which have engulfed 98 blocks and 1,070 panchayats in Bihar. Muzaffarpur district is the latest to be added to the list.

Out of the 56 deaths, 20 have been reported from Araria, nine from West Champaran, eight from Kisanganj, five from Sitamarhi, four from Madhepura, three each from East Champaran, Darbhanga and Madhubani, and one from Sheohar. 1.61 lakh people have been evacuated and taken to safer places, Kumar said. Out of them, 85,949 have been put up in 343 relief camps in different places.

In his Independence Day speech earlier on Tuesday, Nitish expressed concern over the ‘grim flood situation’. “The flood situation caused by incessant rains in Nepal and some districts of north Bihar is grim. The rivers in north Bihar are flowing above the danger level and have caused immense loss and damage,” he said.

Assuring that the government will do everything to ensure relief and rescue operations, Kumar thanked PM Modi for promptly sending the NDRF and Army to the affected areas. The CM had also made an aerial survey of the flood hit areas on Monday.

On Monday, PM Modi had spoken to Kumar regarding the flood situation in the state and assured him of all support from the Centre to mitigate the situation. He said the situation is being monitored closely. Modi also tweeted: “My thoughts are with all those affected by floods in parts of Bihar.”

Principal Secretary of Disaster Management department Pratyay Amrit, who has been coordinating relief and rehabilitation operations, told PTI that community kitchen has been started in camps for flood victims.

With railway tracks inundated, no trains are going beyond Katihar towards north east, East Central Railway (ECR) chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar informed PTI. According to ANI, ten trains have been cancelled for Wednesday and seven for Thursday due to water logging in Katihar Division. Kumar also informed that after cancellation of 33 trains on Monday, Demu service between Samastipur and Raxual and the Gaya-Kamakhya Express were cancelled on Tuesday due to the floods.

**Cracking down on black money, scrutiny of shell firms stepped up** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned high-denomination currency bills in a surprise move late last year, authorities noticed a surge in shell companies depositing cash in banks, seemingly in a bid to hide who owned that wealth.The moment, said a top aide to Modi, was an eye-opener for the government, which had not realized just how much shell companies were being used to hide assets and launder money.Modi's office has formed a team of top law enforcement and revenue officials to go after such companies, according to the aide and a government memo reviewed by Reuters.Last month, the authorities ordered nearly 2 lakh shell companies to be shut down, and the aide said the government is examining hundreds of thousands more.The systematic crackdown on shell companies - which have no active business operations or assets - is perhaps one of the most tangible outcomes of demonetisation , which aimed to hit tax evasion and move India toward cashless, digital transactions that leave a paper trail.""We are very much at war against black money . The impact of this (crackdown) will be huge on shell companies,"" the aide, who cannot be named in line with government rules, told Reuters.In his Independence Day address on Tuesday, Modi claimed credit for going after these companies, and warned that ""looters of the nation's wealth will have to answer.""Modi took office in 2014, vowing to fight corruption and bring back billions of dollars stashed away overseas as well as in real estate, stock markets and front companies through a web of fictitious names.While the move to withdraw 85 per cent of bank notes shook the economy and was widely criticised, the fight against unaccounted wealth carries overwhelming support from ordinary Indians who often have to pay bribes for government services.A high-level task force leading the investigation has found hundreds of shell companies are registered in a few buildings in the eastern city of Kolkata, according to the government note reviewed by Reuters.More than 400 companies listed their address in a dimly-lit colonial-era building at 9/12 Lalbazaar Street.Shops and houses inside 9/12, Lalbazaar Street in Kolkata (Reuters Photo)In its warren of offices were firms offering services such as earthmoving equipment, infrastructure financing, information technology consultants and many others which had office space the size of cubicles.Many were locked, with their padlocks coated in dust.

Patna: RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Saturday demanded a CBI probe into an alleged embezzlement of over Rs 600 crore of government funds by a Bhagalpur-based NGO.

Senior Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar said the amount of fraudulent withdrawal of government funds has gone upto over Rs 600 crore so far in an investigation which was being carried out by the Economic Offence Unit (EOU).

File image of Lalu Prasad. AFPFile image of Lalu Prasad. AFP
On 10 August chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh had said that the amount of government funds that were embezzled by the NGO was around Rs 302.70 crore which might rise further.

Prasad told reporters that the figure of embezzeled funds had reached Rs 1000 crore and claimed that the money had also gone out of the state besides being invested in real estate and other places.

""One can not deny the money laundering aspect. There is the involvement of banks also and hence a state government agency is not capable of carrying out the probe in a fair manner,"" he claimed.

""So, we demand a CBI probe into the scam. Everything will become clear if the CBI carries out probes... We will also request the CAG to do a special audit in this connection. The Enforcement Directorate can also probe it,"" he said.

He also demanded the dismissal of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi from the government for his alleged links with the NGO's founder.

Sushil, who held portfolios of finance and commercial taxes for several years, had the responsibility of finance department without whose permission money cannot be transferred in any bank account, Prasad claimed.

He said it was his duty to put a check on the financial irregularities.

Prasad alleged that both chief minister Nitish Kumar and Sushil had links with the NGO that siphoned off over Rs 1,000 crore of government funds.

Showing a photograph to buttress his claim, the RJD chief claimed that Nitish was awarding the NGO's founder secretary in it.

Sushil and other BJP leaders such as Union minister Giriraj Singh, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, former Union ministers Shahnawaz Hussain and other leaders were also seen in the photograph as they had close links with the NGO, he claimed.

""Our party MLAs will also raise the issue in the upcoming Monsoon Session of state legislature (beginning August 21)... These funds have been transferred in violation of provisions of Bihar Treasury Code and Bihar Finance Rules and Sushil Modi has direct or indirect role in the embezzlement,"" he alleged.

Taking a jibe at Nitish Kumar's review meetings in various districts, the former Bihar CM asked, ""Is it an example of zero tolerance for corruption. Nitish has destroyed the state in the name of development.""

Countering the RJD chief's charges, JD(U) spokesman and MLC Niraj Kumar said allegations could not be made merely on basis of photographs, rather they must be supported by facts.

On Prasad's demand for a CBI probe, Kumar claimed he has suddenly developed a kind of affection for the central agency against which he had been spewing venom.

""The state police are capable of probing the matter. Let the facts come first and then he (Lalu) should react,"" he added.

Meanwhile, the SSP said three more FIRs were lodged in this connection yesterday.

Three separate FIRs have been lodged for embezzlement of funds of District Board, District Nazarat and Cooperative Department.

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned high-denomination currency bills in a surprise move late last year, authorities noticed a surge in shell companies depositing cash in banks, seemingly in a bid to hide who owned that wealth.



The moment, said a top aide to Modi, was an eye-opener for the government, which had not realized just how much shell companies were being used to hide assets and launder money.



Modi's office has formed a team of top law enforcement and revenue officials to go after such companies, according to the aide and a government memo reviewed by Reuters.



Last month, the authorities ordered nearly 200,000 shell companies to be shut down, and the aide said the government is examining hundreds of thousands more.



The systematic crackdown on shell companies - which have no active business operations or assets - is perhaps one of the most tangible outcomes of demonetisation, which aimed to hit tax evasion and move India toward cashless, digital transactions that leave a paper trail.



""We are very much at war against black money. The impact of this (crackdown) will be huge on shell companies,"" the aide, who cannot be named in line with government rules, told Reuters.



In his Independence Day address on Tuesday, Modi claimed credit for going after these companies, and warned that ""looters of the nation's wealth will have to answer.""



Modi took office in 2014, vowing to fight corruption and bring back billions of dollars stashed away overseas as well as in real estate, stock markets and front companies through a web of fictitious names.



While the move to withdraw 85 per cent of bank notes shook the economy and was widely criticised, the fight against unaccounted wealth carries overwhelming support from ordinary Indians who often have to pay bribes for government services.



LALBAZAR STREET, KOLKATA

A high-level task force leading the investigation has found hundreds of shell companies are registered in a few buildings in Kolkata, according to the government note reviewed by Reuters.



More than 400 companies listed their address in a dimly-lit colonial-era building at 9/12 Lalbazar Street.



In its warren of offices were firms offering services such as earthmoving equipment, infrastructure financing, information technology consultants and many others which had office space the size of cubicles.



Many were locked, with their padlocks coated in dust. Others were grimy residential quarters with laundry hanging from the windows.



Data separately provided by Tofler, a company information database service, identified nearly 3,000 companies in two offices in the building. Some were named after flowers.

""The Kolkata industry does the work of obfuscating money trails. Kolkata companies are a huge network that take your money from one end and bring it out the other,"" said the inspector, who didn't want to be identified as he's not authorised to talk to the media.



FRAUD AND EMBEZZLEMENT

The shell companies support much of the fraud and embezzlement in India, tax authorities say.



The owners of these companies create elaborate smokescreens, including naming personal servants and chauffeurs as board directors, the tax inspector said, adding they are used to obscure the ultimate beneficiaries, conceal political investment, route money to evade tax, commit fraud or manipulate tenders.

Coming down hard on terrorism, the United States on Wednesday recognised Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), responsible for terrorist activities in the Kashmir Valley over the years, as a foreign terrorist organisation. The designation comes just days after the HM named Mohammed Bin Qasim as its new chief in Kashmir after the killing of its operation’s chief Yaseen Yatoo alias Mohammed Ghaznavi in an encounter by security personnel in Shopian district.

The US Department of State in a statement said that it had listed the Pakistan-based group as a counter-designated group, freezing any assets it may hold in the United States and prohibiting Americans from any dealings with it. The statement said, “The designation seeks to deny Hizbul Mujahideen the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks. Among other consequences all of Hijbul Mujahideen’s property and interests in property subject to US Jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transaction with the group.”

Hizbul has been involved in numerous attacks on security forces and government establishments in Jammu and Kashmir. The security forces took down its poster boy Burhan Wani last year. Ever since, the organisation has been facing one blow after the other in the Valley. Earlier, the US had also designated Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist just hours before a scheduled meeting between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June.

**Government caps price of knee implants, surgeries to cost nearly 70% less - Times of India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: After coronary stents, the government on Wednesday fixed a price range for knee implants from Rs 54,000 to Rs 1.14 lakh, nearly 70 per cent lower than most surgeries currently cost.With private hospitals reportedly charging exorbitant rates, the government capped the maximum retail price of the knee implants, a move that will save patients an estimated Rs 1,500 crore annually.""Government will not remain a mute spectator and will not allow this illegal and unethical profiteering,"" Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister Ananth Kumar told a news briefing.The price in case of specialised implants for cancer and tumour has been sharply cut to Rs 1,13,950 from the current prices of Rs 4-9 lakh.There are 1.5 crore to 2 crore patients who require knee implant surgery. Every year 1.2 lakh to 1.5 lakh knee surgeries takes place in India, according to the government.It is estimated by World Health Organization (WHO) that by 2020, osteoarthritis is going to be the fourth largest cause of immobility globally, Kumar informed.The government had in February slashed the maximum price of life-saving heart stents implants by up to 85 per cent by capping them at Rs 7,260 for bare metal ones and Rs 29,600 for drug eluting variety.Earlier, the average maximum retail price (MRP) for BMS was Rs 45,000 and for DES, it was Rs 1.21 lakh.Ananth Kumar said today's decision comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced from the Red Fort on the Independence Day that prices of knee surgery would be brought down.Earlier this month, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority had stated that the average trade margin on orthopaedic knee implants were found to be as high as 313 per cent.""After cardiac stents, we have now decided to bring all kinds of knee implants under price control. In our country 1.5 to 2 crore people suffer from knee problems, who need health assistance,"" Kumar said.""The government will not be a mute spectator to illegal and unethical profiteering,"" he added.""Today across the country, private hospitals have increased prices of knee implant surgeries. They are indulging in unethical profiteering. To stop this and give relief to patients, we have taken this decision,"" he said.The decision has been taken keeping people's interest and health security of the nation into consideration, Kumar said.The minister warned of stringent action against hospitals, importers, retailers if they charged in excess of the MRP saying that the government would recover excess profit from such knee implants with 18 per cent interest and may also cancel licences of hospitals.Asked whether industry would be able to recover their costs under the new prices, the minister said: ""The MRP has been fixed after taking into account the landed cost and there will be comfortable margins for the industry.""Reacting to the development, medical device industry body MTaI said MTaI is reviewing the order from NPPA.Under the new price regime, the MRP of most widely used complete knee implant (Cobalt-Chromium) has been fixed at Rs 54,720 plus GST, a reduction of 65 per cent from earlier average MRP of Rs 1,58,324. This particular type of knee implant has around 80 per cent market share.The new MRP of special metal titanium and oxidised zirconium has been fixed at Rs 76,600 plus GST, down 69 per cent from an average rate of Rs 2,49,251 earlier.High flexibility implant will now cost Rs 56,490 plus GST, down 69 per cent from average MRP of Rs 1,81,728 earlier.Special metal and high flexibility knee implants account for another 17 per cent of the market.Revision implants for second surgery, which patients normally need after 10 years, will now cost Rs 1,13,950 plus, lower by 59 per cent from average MRP of Rs 2,76,869.Lastly, the MRP of specialised implants for cancer and tumour has been fixed at Rs 1,13,950 which used to be priced around Rs 4-9 lakh.

**Indian Air Force evacuates stranded school children in Arunachal Pradesh on Independence Day** 

 ______ 
On August 15, when the nation was celebrating Independence Day, tragedy struck a small village in Arunachal Pradesh called Hunli. While returning back from the Independence Day celebration held at their school and crossing a small foot suspension bridge, the bridge collapsed and left the young school children seriously injured.

The district administration immediately requested Gp Capt S J Pendse, station commander of Air Force Station Mohanbari, if a rescue mission could be launched.

Despite the region having experienced incessant rainfall and prolonged marginal weather, the IAF quickly rose to the occasion and an MI-17 helicopter with Wg Cdr K Vinoy as captain was activated. Within an hour-and-a-half of receiving the distress message on cessation of heavy rains at Dibrugarh the helicopter got airborne for Hunli.

Negotiating marginal weather and extremely difficult terrain the helicopter was able to enter the valley testing the crew to its limits all the while. The helicopter finally landed and waited at the helipad till all the available children along with their parents were evacuated. The return flight was equally challenging as the weather continued to deteriorate.

Utilising the extensive flying experience in the sector, the air crew of 127 helicopter unit successfully completed the mission ensuring safe and timely evacuation of the school children. This definitely was one Independence Day that the children, aircrew and all associated with this successful mission will remember for a long time.

**Several Agra madrasas celebrate Independence Day, but no Vande Mataram** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Muslims hold the country's welfare as their foremost patriotic duty: Muslim leader Sami Aghai

2 Central, state governments shouldn't waste time on frivolous issues: Muslim leader Irfan Salim

3 Agra propounded the concept of peace among all communities: Salim

Days after Yogi Adityanath's BJP government controversially obliged madrasas to film Independence Day festivities, over two dozen of celebrated seven decades of freedom from British Raj with the rest of the nation.

But Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's Vande Mataram couldn't be heard in any of them.

A leading Barelvi cleric had on Sunday forbidden Muslims to sing the national anthem or the national song, but said they could sing 'Saare Jahan Se Accha,' the Hindustan Times reported.

But 'Jana Gana Mana' was indeed sung yesterday, as was Muhammad Iqbal's song.

'BASELESS HYPE'

Kari Mudassar Ali Khan Qadri, head of the madrasa in Nagla Mevati, told India Today that the hype over Vande Mataram was baseless and only served to create a dispute between Hindus and Muslims.

Independence Day is a festival that celebrates independence, but the Hindu outfits are trying to curb the religious freedom of Muslims in the name of patriotism, he said.

Singing Vande Mataram isn't mandatory and whoever wants to sing it is free to do so, but no devout Muslim will - as it's against the tenets of Islam, he explained.

Exerting pressure on madrasas in this way isn't good, as they have a very important role to play in the cultural and intellectual development of a large section of Indian society, he added.

'UNNECESSARY RUCKUS'

Bhartiya Muslim Vikas Parishad Chairman Sami Aghai said the Modi and Adityanath governments were creating an unnecessary ruckus over Vande Mataram.

Muslims love their country and hold the country's welfare as their foremost patriotic duty, but they shouldn't be forced to do something that goes against their religion in the name of showing their patriotism towards India, he said.

A lot of hardline Muslim organizations opposed the government's directives (to madrasas) to organise and film Independence Day celebrations, but madrasas still celebrated with a fervor that hasn't been seen in recent years, he added.

'FRIVOLOUS ISSUES'

UP Sarvdaliy Muslim Action Committee President Syed Irfan Salim said the central and state governments should think about development, instead of wasting their energy and valuable time on frivolous issues like Vande Mataram.

He said India offers complete religious freedom to all communities and this freedom is ingrained in the Constitution, so the government should be focusing on development and not on trying to meddle into religious issues like the singing of Vande Mataram and triple talaq, he explained.

If the law-and-order situation of any state gets affected due to these frivolities, it will break the pace of development in that particular state, he said.

Salim added that the city of Agra - an international tourism hub - propounded the concept of 'Sulh-e-Kul' (Peace among all communities) and if any communal incidents take place in Agra, they affect the entire country's image on the global stage.

**Exposed: How maulvis take money for one-night stand with divorced women trying to save marriage** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 India Today's undercover reporters have exposed the rot in the taboo tradition

2 The business of one-night grooms was found to be widespread

3 In some cases it was found that even clerics brokered the deals

As awful as that may sound, a number of religious scholars are offering themselves up for one-night stands with divorced Muslim women trying to save their marriages under a disputable Islamic law, an India Today investigation has found.

They charge anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh to participate in nikah halala, a controversial practice that requires a woman to marry someone else, sleep with him and get a divorce again in order to be able to remarry her first husband under personal laws, the probe discovered.

India Today's investigative team has blown the lid off the taboo tradition that has remained largely unnoticed amid intense debates over triple talaq on the media and in the country's top court.

The probe found many Islamic scholars putting themselves up on sale for women desperate to restore their broken marriages.

At a restaurant in Ghaziabad, the undercover team first met Mohammed Nadeem, an imam at Madina Masjid in Moradabad's Lal Bagh neighbourhood.

MARRIED CLERICS READY FOR ONE-NIGHT STAND

The cleric, the investigation found, was already married. Still, he negotiated his role-play as a husband for a night with India Today's reporters posing as relatives of a divorced Muslim woman.

""Will your wife object to it?"" asked India Today's reporter.

""No, no. She won't have any objection,"" imam Nadeem replied.

""Have you spoken with her?"" prodded the reporter.

""No, I haven't spoken with her. I haven't told her. What's the need to tell her?"" Nadeem shot back.

The Moradabad imam admitted he had officiated several nikah halala marriages before. This time, he proposed a package deal for the entire service, including sex.

""It's Rs 1 lakh,"" he demanded. Imam Nadeem guaranteed issuing divorce after spending a night with the bride for her to become eligible to go back to her first husband in accordance with the personal law.

The business of one-night grooms is widespread, the India Today investigation observed.

DELHI

At Delhi's Jamia Nagar, the team met Zubair Qasmi, a qualified maulana married with two wives. He nominated himself up for a third at the prospect of nikah halala, in exchange for money.

""I spend many nights out. It's much easier to manage this with two (wives). One would think I am with the second. And the second would think I am with the other. It's not at all difficult with two (wives),"" he bragged.

Zubair Qasim based his fee on mehr - money or gift the groom pledges to his bride during Islamic marriages.

""Don't worry about anything. I'll make every arrangement. If Rs 30,000 is set as mehr, it will be either 40,000 or 50,000 (in return for participation in nikah halala). No problem in it,"" Qasim said.

The rot runs deep.

Next, India Today's investigative journalists visited Mohammad Mustaquim of Delhi's Darul Uloom Mahmoodia Madrasa.

Educated in Islamic studies, he was keen to do what he had done several times before -- sleeping with divorced women to consummate nikah halala.

""There was a woman in the room. I went there and had sex. Before leaving at 2-3 am, I divorced her,"" he confessed.

NO FORMAL MARRIAGE NEEDED?

Mohammad Mustaquim performed nikah halala even without formal marriage.

""So you have taken part in three nikah halala. You actually married on one occasion, right? The other two nikha halala were without marriage,"" the reporter asked.

""Without marriage,"" he admitted. ""After sleeping with her, I left at 1 am.""

Mustaquim's fee for this service included donation for his madrasa. ""You'll have to pay Rs 20,000 for the madrasa. I am ready to do it for whatever amount. I have done it several times before,"" he said.

As India awaits the Supreme Court's judgement over triple talaq, the dangerous trapdoor of nikah halala remains wide open for divorced Muslim women, the probe noted.

THE ROLE OF CLERICS

In some cases, potential deals were found to be brokered by clerics themselves.

At Bulandshahr's Til Gaon, imam Zahir-ul-lah of Mewatian Masjid introduced India Today's undercover reporters with a prospective groom for nikah halala.

Arif, the groom-to-be, was quick to boast about his masculinity despite his old age.

""My programme is all set, today, tomorrow or the day after. I am always fit 24x7, mashallah!"" he remarked. His price: Rs 25,000 for a night.

In western UP's Hapur district, the team next met Mohammed Zahid, who runs a madrasa at Sikheda village.

He marketed his services for nikah halala as a professional.

""We'll see to it. We have the men. It will be done through them. If you don't trust them, I am always available for it,"" he said.

""How much money in total would you like us to organise for you?"" asked the reporter.

""Between 1 lakh and 1.5 lakh,"" he answered. ""Not above Rs 1.5 lakh and not less than Rs 1 lakh.""

HINDU, MUSLIM LEADERS REACT SHARPLY AFTER EXPOSE

Rising above their political differences, Hindu and Muslim leaders called nikah halala a criminal act after India Today broadcast its investigation.

They demanded that the perpetrators should be prosecuted for rape.

""This is lust. It's not permissible in Islam. This is a criminal offence committed in the name of religion,"" said Maulana Maqsood-ul-Hasan Qasmi, the head of the Imam Council of India. ""These people should be thrown out of the mosques. They should be booked.""

Zafar Sareshwala, chancellor of the Maulana Azad National Urdu university, blamed personal laws for certain regressive practices in Islam.

""These people should be put in jail and charged with rape,"" he said, demanding strong action against men participating in nikah halala for one-night stands. ""I think the genesis of the problem lies in the Shariat Act of 1937,"" he insisted. Authors of the personal laws, he added, had been ""millions of miles away"" from the teachings of Islam.

Maulana Ansar Raza of the Gharib Nawaz Foundation called for immediate ex-communication of religious scholars offering themselves for nikah halala. ""They should be beaten with shoes and thrown out of mosques. They should be charged with rape. Nikah halala is a regressive un-Islamic practice,"" he said. ""I salute India Today for this story.""

In his comments, BJP spokesman Gaurav Bhatia, himself a lawyer, underscored the need for abolishing nikah halala like the sati practice in Hinduism. ""Nikah halala and polygamy, as triple talaq are regressive. Sati is abolished. So should be these practices,"" he said. ""India Today's expose will help the civilised society to come forward for human rights and dignity.""

**Hizbul Mujahideen Designated As Foreign Terrorist Group By US** 

 ______ 
Syed Salahuddin, the chief of Hizbul Mujahideen was declared a global
terrorist in June. (File photo)

**Washington: **

The United States has added the Hizbul Mujahideen to its blacklist of nearly
60 terrorist organisations today, a move that comes just a month after Syed
Salahuddin, the group's chief based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was
designated a ""global terrorist"".

In a statement, the US State Department said Hizbul Mujahideen has been
designated as a foreign terrorist organisation and a specially designated
global terrorist under different laws.

The State Department designation bans US citizens and residents from dealing
with the group, and any assets found to belong to the Hizbul Mujahideen in
areas under US jurisdiction will be frozen.

""These designations seek to deny HM (Hizbul Mujahideen) the resources it needs
to carry out terrorist attacks,"" it said.

Such designations, however, have had limited impact on functioning of
terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir. Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin was
designated a ""global terrorist"" by the United States during Prime Minister
Narendra Modi visit to the country.

But Salahuddin continues to operate freely in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir and
had, along with Pakistan, denounced the US move.

""We should take the step for what it is,"" Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar had
underlined back in June during PM Modi's US visit, decoding what the US
calling Salahuddin a global terrorist would achieve.

""It is fixing responsibility, highlighting the problem. There is a signalling
out of it, it is focusing on a particular group and particular individual.
None of us can really miss that message,"" Mr Jaishankar said.

For India, the US ban on Salahuddin and the Hizbul is seen as a diplomatic
victory, particularly since it is one of the largest group operating in
Kashmir. It is also the only major terror outfit in the Kashmir valley that
focuses on recruiting local youth to its ranks who are projected as ""freedom
fighters"".

It was this narrative that seemed to have found some acceptance in the US
administration which had blacklisted outfits such as the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen
and Jaish-e-Mohammed in 1997 and 2001 respectively, but had spared the Hizbul.

**US terms Hizbul Mujahideen a foreign terror outfit, seeks to choke its funding** 

 ______ 
A day after US president Donald Trump called PM Narendra Modi to greet him on India's Independence Day, the US designated Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen , responsible for terrorist attacks in J&amp;K for the last three decades, as a ""foreign terrorist organisation"".The labelling of Hizbul as an FTO means the outfit will face financial sanctions. The Trump administration's previous decision to designate Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin a ""global terrorist"" came just ahead of Modi's meeting with the US President in Washington in June.The announcement is also read as a sign of US-India proximity on strategic issues at a time when India is locked in a tense military face-off with China and is facing a daily dose of threatening statements from Beijing. The action against Hizb also indicates that the US does not support China's efforts to protect terror groups sustained by Pakistan against international sanctions.The US designation of Hizbul Mujahideen as a ""foreign terrorist organisation"" seeks to deny it the resources it needs to carry out terrorist attacks, the State Department said in a media note announcing the move.Among other consequences, it said, all of HM's property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the group.The move comes ahead of a widely-awaited review of South Asia strategy -involving Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India -which Trump will preside over on Friday at Camp David with vice-president Mike Pence and the National Security team.The US decision is seen as an act of solidarity with India in its fight against terrorism and jihadi outfits operating out of Pakistan with the support of the Pakistani army and ISI. The decision, as in the case of Salahuddin, acknowledges India's arguments that the Hizbul and its leaders are terrorists rather than ""freedom fighters"" as claimed by Pakistan and separatists in J&amp;K. Hizbul is now in the same list as Al Qaeda, Islamic State , Boko Haram or other Pakistan-based anti-India terror outfits such as Lashkar-eToiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad .India now has a strong chance to push its case for designating Syed Salahuddin and Hizbul Mujahideen as `global terror outfits' in UN Security Council.

**7 reasons why Irans Chabahar port is crucial to India** 

 ______ 
In May 2016, Narendra Modi became the first Indian prime minister in 15 years to visit Iran, and during his visit, he pledged up to $500 million to develop and operate Iran's Chabahar port as part of a trilateral engagement between India, Iran and Afghanistan.

Chabahar has two ports -- Shahid Kalantari and Shahid Beheshti -- each with five berths. The project investment arm of the shipping ministry -- India Ports Global -- is partnering with a joint venture between the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Gujarat's Kandla Port Trust to develop two container berths with a length of 640 metres and three multi-cargo berths by investing $85 million.

On August 5, 2017, Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Road, Transport, Highways and Shipping, who was on a two-day deputation to Iran to represent India at the oath taking ceremony of President Hassan Rouhani, said that the government is hopeful that the strategic Chabahar port will be functional by 2018. ""India and Iran have been historically sharing special ties. We're keen on developing Chabahar Port and are hopeful of starting operations in 12 to 18 months,"" Gadkari told PTI.

WHERE IS CHABAHAR PORT?

Iran's Chabahar port is located on the Gulf of Oman and is the only oceanic port of the country. The port gives access to the energy-rich Persian Gulf nations' southern coast and India can bypass Pakistan with the Chabahar port becoming functional.

The saints associated with the VHP may take up the issue during a meeting likely to be convened by the Vishva Hindu Parishad soon, office bearers of the Hindu organisation told HT.

While the demand for cow protection isn’t new for the VHP, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) affiliate, the push for a cow ministry is timed with BJP chief Amit Shah indicating in Lucknow that a cow ministry was among the several proposals under discussion.

Concluding his three-day visit to the state capital last week, Shah was asked if the Modi government had any plans to set up a cow ministry, a demand that had been regularly flagged by saints in the three years since the NDA came to power. “Various suggestions have come. Discussions are on,” Shah had said during the end of his press meet to spark speculation.

“The issue of cow protection has always been dear to us. Now, we expect a dedicated ministry to support and boost an entire cow-friendly ecosystem,” said the VHP’s Ayodhya-based spokesman Sharad Sharma.

**Congress lifts Amma canteen idea, Rahul Gandhi's 'blooper' gives it away** 

 ______ 
BENGALURU: Rahul Gandhi referred to the Karnataka Congress government 's move to provide subsidised food to people as "" Amma canteen "" before realising his gaffe and correcting it at the inauguration of the scheme here on Wednesday.Modelled on the lines of late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa's Amma canteens , the Indira canteens will serve breakfast at Rs 5 and lunch and dinner at Rs 10each. Saying no one would go hungry in Bengaluru, Rahul said, ""That's the vision of the Amma... Indira canteen,"" quickly correcting himself.The Rs 88 crore project envisages canteens in each of the 198 wards of Bengaluru. While 101 canteens were inaugurated on Wednesday, the remaining 97 will open on October 2.Towards the end of his speech too, Rahul said eradicating poverty and feeding the hungry was the ""vision of Amma"" and then corrected it to Indira. A combative Siddaramaiah later said, ""Some say we have copied Tamil Nadu's Amma canteen project. What is wrong in copying programmes for the poor?TN canteens only give breakfast and lunch. Our canteens will offer dinner as well."" Rahul ridiculed PM Narendra Modi for shortening his Independence speech by the year. ""Modi is reducing the duration of his speeches by the year, as now he has nothing to talk about,"" he said at the rally. ""My mom (Sonia) had attended the Independence Day parade and I asked her, how was Modi's speech. She said, it was shorter than last year,"" Rahul added.Last August 15, Rahul said, Modi had made the longest Independence Day speech ever by any PM taking 97 minutes. But this year, he limited his speech to just 57 minutes, his shortest in four years. ""Next year, I am sure it will come down to 45 minutes and subsequent year to 15 minutes,"" he added. Incidentally, this year's was Modi's fourth IDay speech. Rahul also claimed that the unemployment rate in the country is the highest in eight years.""Modi promised two crore jobs yearly when he took as CM. But the rate of unemployment today is highest in eight years. The BJP doesn't care about poor, farmers and dalits like Congresss does,"" he said. Rahul also scoffed at Modi through a live demonstration on how he had hugged Chinese president. While saying this he hugged former Karnataka legislative council chairman B L Shankar, who was translating his English speech to Kannada even as the crowd burst into laughter.

**Knee implants to cost up to 69% less as government caps prices** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Acting swiftly on PM Narendra Modi 's Independence Day promise to take steps to rein in healthcare costs, the government on Wednesday said it is placing knee implants under price control.The government has slashed the prices of knee implants by between 59% and 69% using a special provision in the drug pricing law that enables it to intervene in ""extraordinary circumstances"" in public interest. The move is expected to benefit over three crore arthritis patients in India needing knee replacement surgery Official sources said hip implants and intraocular lenses are the next items likely to attract the attention of the regulatory scanner.TOI was the first to report, in its edition of August 5, 2017, that a price cap on orthopaedic knee implants was imminent following an analysis by the price regulator that showed manufacturers, distributors and hospitals were earning up to 450% trade margins on widely used devices.The standard, widely used cobalt chromium in knee replacement surgery will now cost Rs 54,720 as against an earlier MRP of Rs 1,58,324. Similarly, the price of special metals like titanium and oxidised zirconium have been slashed by almost 70%, to Rs 76,600 from Rs 2.49 lakh. In case of revision knee replacement, which is usually done if the primary replacement fails, prices of implants have been cut by 59%.The government said there was ""unjustified, unreasonable and irrational"" profiteering and trade margins on these devices, leading to exorbitant prices that push up patients' out-of-pocket expenses. In fact, the high costs make treatment unaffordable for many who need arthroplasty procedures.The regulator national pharmaceutical pricing authority finds that it is urgently necessary to act in public interest and has fixed and notified ceiling prices of orthopaedic knee implants for knee replacement systems, the order issued by the department of pharmaceuticals said.""The government will not be a mute spectator to illegal and unethical profiteering,"" chemicals and fertilisers minister Ananth Kumar said. He added the government would take stringent action against hospitals, importers and retailers if they charged in excess of the MRP fixed by the government.According to government estimates, the price regulation of knee implants alone will lead to a saving of about Rs 1,500 crore annually for patients.The new prices come into effect immediately and will also apply to all available stocks for sale in trade channels.""The success of the order will depend on what steps are taken by the government to ensure that the overall procedure costs come down as a result of this price fixation,"" Malini Aisola of the All-India Drug Action Network said.""We hope this is just the tip of the iceberg and the government will go on to regulate prices of all other critical medical devices where similar market conditions prevail,"" said Gurinder Grewal, former president of the Punjab Medical Council.A price cap on implants is expected to benefit millions of patients with orthopaedic problems. Industry data, which experts say does not fully capture the picture, shows over three crore arthritic patients in India in need of knee replacement surgery. Since this is not a life-threatening disease, the number of patients opting for surgery is comparatively low.Even then, estimates show that over 1,20,000 knee replacement procedures, and about 70,000 hip procedures, take place every year in India. And the costs are not low. Preliminary analysis by the NPPA shows the MRP of the total knee system ranges between Rs 59,091 and Rs 4,13,059. Add to this hospital costs, surgeon charges, time in the operation theatre, and several other miscellaneous charges. The latest price regulation by government is seen, in this context, as a step towards rationalising healthcare costs.

**Centre plans to sell generic medicines at fuel stations** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is working on opening 'Jan Aushadhi' (generic medicines) stores at petrol pumps belonging to state-run fuel retailers across the country with a view to make cheap drugs accessible to masses, Union oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Wednesday.""Oil marketing companies are bringing an ecosystem of non-fuel retail business at petrol pumps through tieups. The Jan Aushadhi stores under the department of pharmaceuticals in the chemicals &amp; fertilizers ministry will also be opened at the outlets in the future,"" Pradhan said after the fuel retailers inked MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Ltd for selling energy-efficient appliances and LED bulbs from petrol pumps.But shortage of qualified pharmacists have emerged as a problem. Under law, drug stores need to have qualified pharmacists. While most of the private drug stores list such pharmacists, they are seldom present. ""As government entity, we can't do that,"" a person familiar with inter-government discussions told TOI. But the officials were hopeful of finding a way and said it will also open job opportunities.EESL is a company promoted by state-run power utilities. It is spearheading the government's flagship 'Ujala' scheme to replace all incandescent and CFL bulbs in the country with LED lamps by 2019.Pradhan said the IT ministry's 'Common Service Centre' concept is also being explored to offer government services such as issuing PAN and E-Aadhaar cards, utility bill payments, banking solutions and agriservices at the pumps.Power, coal and renewable energy minister Piyush Goyal said the MoU was an example of how the Narendra Modi government worked as a single unit.Under the tie-up with IndianOil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, EESL will leverage the network of their 55,000 petrol pumps, which have a daily footfall of 3.5 crore, to sell LED bulbs and other energy efficient appliances.""It is worth noting that two important ministries have come together to realise the Prime Minister's vision of every citizen having access to energy efficient appliances. The marketing network of the three oil marketing companies is unparalleled and this tie-up will only accelerate and scale up the distribution of energy efficient appliances across the length and breadth of the country,"" he said.EESL will make the entire upfront investment for ensuring availability of the products at the outlets and no upfront capital cost will be borne by the oil marketing companies, barring manpower and space. EESL will pay 10% to the outlets on sale. The consumer can purchase high-quality 9W LED bulbs for Rs 70, 20W LED tubelight for Rs 220 and five-star rated ceiling fan for Rs 1,200.

**India Inc calls for strengthening policy reforms, job creation**

CII President Shobana Kamineni (File) CII President Shobana Kamineni (File)

Lauding the government’s efforts to deal with corruption and black money, industry chamber CII on Tuesday called for strengthening policy reforms, including a new industrial policy, creating jobs and empowering women at the workplace. It said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, has “outlined a vision of a secure, prosperous and capable nation by 2022”.

“While welcoming lower inflation and downward interest rate cycle, CII called for strengthening policy reforms including a new industrial policy, entrepreneurship and employment creation, and empowerment of women in the workforce,” the industry body said in a statement.

CII President Shobana Kamineni said, “The development task to 2022 is challenging and will require strong policy action across multiple economic and social sectors. The government has made a significant beginning, and all of us will need to put our hands together to move the needle of development.” “The Prime Minister has outlined a vision of a secure, prosperous and capable nation by 2022, driven by the collective power of 125 crore citizens of India,” she said.

CII’s India@75 campaign launched in 2008 is in line with Prime Minister’s objectives and emphasises crowd-sourcing of ideas and spread of volunteerism to build a developed India, she added. “The government has taken multiple steps to address corruption and black money which are delivering notable results.

“CII believes that reforms such as GST and ease of doing business will further contribute to formalisation of the economy and widening the tax net, and we look forward to a more transparent and efficient economy by 2022,” added Kamineni.

Commenting on the Prime Minister’s speech, industry chamber Ficci said, “The Prime Minister clearly articulated a new narrative for India – a country which is strong, where people have economic opportunities, where there is no room for corruption or nepotism, and where the binding factor for all is Indianness.”

**Exposed: How maulvis take money for one-night stand with divorced women trying to save marriage** 

 ______ 
Highlights India Today's undercover reporters have exposed the rot in the taboo tradition

The business of one-night grooms was found to be widespread

In some cases it was found that even clerics brokered the deals

As awful as that may sound, a number of religious scholars are offering themselves up for one-night stands with divorced Muslim women trying to save their marriages under a disputable Islamic law, an India Today investigation has found.

They charge anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh to participate in nikah halala, a controversial practice that requires a woman to marry someone else, sleep with him and get a divorce again in order to be able to remarry her first husband under personal laws, the probe discovered.

India Today's investigative team has blown the lid off the taboo tradition that has remained largely unnoticed amid intense debates over triple talaq on the media and in the country's top court.

The probe found many Islamic scholars putting themselves up on sale for women desperate to restore their broken marriages.

At a restaurant in Ghaziabad, the undercover team first met Mohammed Nadeem, an imam at Madina Masjid in Moradabad's Lal Bagh neighbourhood.

MARRIED CLERICS READY FOR ONE-NIGHT STAND

The cleric, the investigation found, was already married. Still, he negotiated his role-play as a husband for a night with India Today's reporters posing as relatives of a divorced Muslim woman.

""Will your wife object to it?"" asked India Today's reporter.

""No, no. She won't have any objection,"" imam Nadeem replied.

""Have you spoken with her?"" prodded the reporter.

""No, I haven't spoken with her. I haven't told her. What's the need to tell her?"" Nadeem shot back.

The Moradabad imam admitted he had officiated several nikah halala marriages before. This time, he proposed a package deal for the entire service, including sex.

""It's Rs 1 lakh,"" he demanded. Imam Nadeem guaranteed issuing divorce after spending a night with the bride for her to become eligible to go back to her first husband in accordance with the personal law.

The business of one-night grooms is widespread, the India Today investigation observed.

DELHI

At Delhi's Jamia Nagar, the team met Zubair Qasmi, a qualified maulana married with two wives. He nominated himself up for a third at the prospect of nikah halala, in exchange for money.

""I spend many nights out. It's much easier to manage this with two (wives). One would think I am with the second. And the second would think I am with the other. It's not at all difficult with two (wives),"" he bragged.

Zubair Qasim based his fee on mehr - money or gift the groom pledges to his bride during Islamic marriages.

""Don't worry about anything. I'll make every arrangement. If Rs 30,000 is set as mehr, it will be either 40,000 or 50,000 (in return for participation in nikah halala). No problem in it,"" Qasim said.

The rot runs deep.

Next, India Today's investigative journalists visited Mohammad Mustaquim of Delhi's Darul Uloom Mahmoodia Madrasa.

Educated in Islamic studies, he was keen to do what he had done several times before -- sleeping with divorced women to consummate nikah halala.

""There was a woman in the room. I went there and had sex. Before leaving at 2-3 am, I divorced her,"" he confessed.

NO FORMAL MARRIAGE NEEDED?

Mohammad Mustaquim performed nikah halala even without formal marriage.

""So you have taken part in three nikah halala. You actually married on one occasion, right? The other two nikha halala were without marriage,"" the reporter asked.

""Without marriage,"" he admitted. ""After sleeping with her, I left at 1 am.""

Mustaquim's fee for this service included donation for his madrasa. ""You'll have to pay Rs 20,000 for the madrasa. I am ready to do it for whatever amount. I have done it several times before,"" he said.

As India awaits the Supreme Court's judgement over triple talaq, the dangerous trapdoor of nikah halala remains wide open for divorced Muslim women, the probe noted.

THE ROLE OF CLERICS

In some cases, potential deals were found to be brokered by clerics themselves.

At Bulandshahr's Til Gaon, imam Zahir-ul-lah of Mewatian Masjid introduced India Today's undercover reporters with a prospective groom for nikah halala.

Arif, the groom-to-be, was quick to boast about his masculinity despite his old age.

""My programme is all set, today, tomorrow or the day after. I am always fit 24x7, mashallah!"" he remarked. His price: Rs 25,000 for a night.

In western UP's Hapur district, the team next met Mohammed Zahid, who runs a madrasa at Sikheda village.

He marketed his services for nikah halala as a professional.

""We'll see to it. We have the men. It will be done through them. If you don't trust them, I am always available for it,"" he said.

""How much money in total would you like us to organise for you?"" asked the reporter.

""Between 1 lakh and 1.5 lakh,"" he answered. ""Not above Rs 1.5 lakh and not less than Rs 1 lakh.""

HINDU, MUSLIM LEADERS REACT SHARPLY AFTER EXPOSE

Rising above their political differences, Hindu and Muslim leaders called nikah halala a criminal act after India Today broadcast its investigation.

They demanded that the perpetrators should be prosecuted for rape.

""This is lust. It's not permissible in Islam. This is a criminal offence committed in the name of religion,"" said Maulana Maqsood-ul-Hasan Qasmi, the head of the Imam Council of India. ""These people should be thrown out of the mosques. They should be booked.""

Zafar Sareshwala, chancellor of the Maulana Azad National Urdu university, blamed personal laws for certain regressive practices in Islam.

""These people should be put in jail and charged with rape,"" he said, demanding strong action against men participating in nikah halala for one-night stands. ""I think the genesis of the problem lies in the Shariat Act of 1937,"" he insisted. Authors of the personal laws, he added, had been ""millions of miles away"" from the teachings of Islam.

Maulana Ansar Raza of the Gharib Nawaz Foundation called for immediate ex-communication of religious scholars offering themselves for nikah halala. ""They should be beaten with shoes and thrown out of mosques. They should be charged with rape. Nikah halala is a regressive un-Islamic practice,"" he said. ""I salute India Today for this story.""

In his comments, BJP spokesman Gaurav Bhatia, himself a lawyer, underscored the need for abolishing nikah halala like the sati practice in Hinduism. ""Nikah halala and polygamy, as triple talaq are regressive. Sati is abolished. So should be these practices,"" he said. ""India Today's expose will help the civilised society to come forward for human rights and dignity.""

**View: China may be fighting the Doklam war on Pakistan front** 

 ______ 
Will India and China go to war over Doklam ? India has refrained from showing any aggression so far. China has heightened the war rhetoric but without backing it with any solid action. It seems China does not want an actual war but a prolonged, war-like situation.China cannot start a war with India, even if it's a localised conflict, over a small piece of high-altitude land that remains hard to access most of the time. Such a misadventure will carry heavy diplomatic, economic and even military costs.China has begun to project itself as a responsible global power as it seeks to enlarge its international footprint. Its huge debt—about 300 per cent of GDP — even if most of it is state-owned and thus manageable, remains a big economic challenge. India is a nuclear power, and there is no guarantee a local conflict won't blow out of control.Then why is China risking a costly war? The answer to this question lies in two biggest developments in the subcontinent in the past few years: India's surgical strike inside the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir last year and China planning to build a global network of roads, ports and railways which it calls 'One Belt, One Road' (OBOR). India boycotted the grand launch of OBOR because a part of it—China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).India's opposition to OBOR is the biggest sore point between India and China today. And that could be the reason behind China's Doklam posture. Border disputes have lingered on for decades and have rarely led to such a prolonged stand-off.So, the actual theatre of Doklam war might not be the India-Bhutan-China tri-junction where Indian and Chinese soldiers are facing off. It could be thousands of kilometres away—the Line of Control between India and Pakistan. In Doklam, China might be maneuvering to secure CPEC, its biggest strategic asset in the region.CPEC is a network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's Xinjiang region to the Gwadar Port in Pakistan. It can give China an alternative to its main trade route that passes through the Strait of Malacca and the Indian Ocean. CPEC will provide a shorter and cheaper access to markets in Asia, Africa and even Europe. More importantly, it will not be vulnerable to disruption by India which can now cut off Chinese supplies through the Indian Ocean.The Chinese move at Doklam might have been prompted by India's aggressive military posture against Pakistan after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power. For the first time, India under PM Modi openly supported rebels in Pakistan's Balochistan who pose a serious threat to CPEC. Two Chinese citizens working on CPEC were abducted and killed by Baloch rebels two months ago.A restive Balochistan is not the only challenge to CPEC.CPEC passes through PoK, and that's why India had boycotted China's ambitious OBOR project. India has always laid claim to PoK but now it has also started talking of getting it back from Pakistan. Local leaders in PoK often speak favourably of India. India's surgical strikes on Pakistan-sponsored terrorists in PoK last year signaled its aggressive military stance and the will to dominate in the disputed region.India's assertion in PoK and support to Baloch rebels are threats to CPEC. India's military dominance on Pakistan means CPEC may not materialise at all. By engaging India at Doklam, China might want to divert Indian military away from the Pakistan border and thus reduce the threat to CPEC.CPEC is going to be the showpiece for China's OBOR project which it hardsells as a global economic partnership that can lift less-developed countries out of poverty.OBOR has economic as well as strategic importance for China. It will not only provide China vast markets and ownership of infrastructure projects in dozens of smaller countries in Asia and Africa, but also offer strategic assets in host countries which, unable to repay expensive Chinese debt, will sooner or later submit to its plans.India's military aggression against Pakistan—to check its sponsorship of terror in India—will ensure CPEC does not have a smooth going. If India remains engaged on the eastern front—at Doklam or any other similar spot— its focus will shift away from Pakistan and give China an opportunity to complete CPEC smoothly.When Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat said in June that India was ready for “two-and-a-half front war”—a war with Pakistan, China and terrorists within India—maybe he was responding to China's hidden ploy.A major scuffle, which included stone-pelting, took place between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the Line of Actual Control at eastern Ladakh in the western sector on Tuesday. The confrontation between the rival soldiers took place on the north bank of the Pangong Tso (Tso means lake) in eastern Ladakh. This skirmish too could be part of the Chinese strategy to engage Indian military at different points to dilute its focus on Pakistan.(DISCLAIMER: Views expressed above are the author's own.)

MUMBAI: In line with the government's policy, the RBItoday said farmers can avail of short-term crop loans of up to Rs 3 lakh at subsidised interest rate of 7 per cent that could go down to 4 per cent on prompt repayment.""To ensure hassle-free benefits to farmers under the Interest Subvention Scheme, the banks are advised to make Aadhaar linkage mandatory for availing of short-term crop loans in 2017-18,"" the RBI said in a notification to banks.In order to provide short-term crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh to farmers at an interest rate of 7 per cent per annum during 2017-18, it has been decided to offer interest subvention of 2 per cent to banks in respect of loans given by their rural and semi-urban branches only on use of their own resources.This interest subvention of 2 per cent will be calculated on the crop loan amount from the date of its disbursement up to the date of actual repayment by the farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum of one year, it said.An additional interest subvention of 3 per cent per annum will be available to ""prompt payee farmers"".""This also implies that the farmers paying promptly as above would get short-term crop loans at 4 per cent per annum during 2017-18,"" it said.In order to discourage distress sale and encourage farmers to store produce in warehouses, it said the benefit of subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers with Kisan Credit Cards for a further period of up to 6 months post harvest at the same rate as available to crop loans against negotiable warehouse receipts.The warehouses should be accredited with the Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority ( WDRA ), it said.To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, an interest subvention of 2 per cent per annum will be made available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan, it said, adding that such loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards.To avoid multiple loaning and ensure only genuine farmers avail of concessional crop loans through the mechanism of gold loans, the lending institutions may conduct due diligence and ensure proper documentation, including recording of land details, even when the farmer takes gold loans for such purposes, it said.Earlier in June, the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had approved the interest subvention scheme for 2017-18.The Cabinet has approved total expenditure of Rs 20,339 crore for this fiscal as interest subsidy on short-term crop loans.

**Maharashtra lawyer files plea over PM Modi’s use of ‘Hindustan’ in I-Day speech** 

 ______ 
A city lawyer has filed a plea questioning the contents of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, claiming it has violated constitutional provisions.

In her complaint addressed to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and lodged with MIDC Police Station, advocate Rama Vitthalrao Kale has contended Modi referred to India and Bharat as “Hindustan”, several times in his 55-minute long speech from the Red Fort on Tuesday.

“As per the Article 1 of the Constitution, India or Bharat are mentioned. Nowhere in the constitution there is a mention of ‘Hindustan’ which signifies the religious name of the country,” Kale told IANS here on Wednesday.

She claimed that the “disrespectful” reference to India as “Hindustan” before an audience of 125 crore Indians and many more people around the world, has hurt the sentiments of all patriotic countrymen.

“As the PM of India, making such an irresponsible and wrong reference (as ‘Hindustan’) which finds no place in the Constitution is a clear disrespect to the Constitution and violation of the Article 1,” Kale pointed out.

Accordingly, she urged Fadnavis — who also holds the Home portfolio — to take cognisance and register a case of “treason” and other relevant sections against Modi.

She said as the Prime Minister, it is his duty to uphold and protect the Constitution and by his utterances in the Independence Day speech, he has failed to do so.

Kale will meet the Aurangabad Police Commissioner Yashasvi Yadav on Wednesday afternoon and seek action in the matter.

**2 Gujarat Cops Accused In Ishrat Jahan Case Forced To Quit By Top Court** 

 ______ 
2 Gujarat cops accused in fake encounter cases, including Ishrat Jahan case
forced to quit by top court

**New Delhi: **

Senior Gujarat police officers NK Amin and Tarun Barot, accused in encounter
killings including that of 19-year-old student Ishrat Jahan, gave their word
to the Supreme Court today that they would resign.

The reappointment of the two officers by the state government after their
retirement had been challenged in court by a retired police officer, Rahul
Sharma.

Mr Amin was rehired on contract as Superintendent of Police in the Tapi
district and Mr Barot was a Deputy Superintendent of Police in the Railways.

The Supreme Court had said yesterday that the Gujarat government must take a
call on the officers or it would pass orders.

After the strong observations of the judges including Chief Justice JS Khehar,
the two officers pledged to resign in the course of the day.

Rahul Sharma, a former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, had questioned the
Gujarat government for re-appointing officers who faced serious charges.

His petition alleged that Mr Amin has faced trial in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh
and Ishrat Jahan encounter killings and has spent close to eight years in jail
but he was ""immediately reinstated"" after his release.

Mr Barot was accused in the Sadiq Jaman and Ishrat Jahan killings, was accused
in two cases of abduction and murder and spent close to three years in jail,
said the petition.

Appointments have been made despite ""bearing in mind the questionable track
record of the two officers"", in violation of Supreme Court guidelines and ""the
doctrine of public trust"", the petition said.

Earlier this year, another top officer accused in the Ishrat Jahan case, PP
Pandey, was forced to resign as Director General of Police.

Ishrat Jahan and three others were killed in an alleged fake encounter in
Gujarat in June 2004. The Gujarat Police said they were Lashkar terrorists and
were in Gujarat to assassinate the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

A CBI court is hearing the Ishrat Jahan case. The CBI has filed two charge-
sheets, the first of which accuses Gujarat police officers of staging a fake
encounter to kill the four people.

As per tradition, the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Delhi Area, a Lt General-rank officer, escorts the Prime Minister to the dais, stands behind him as he delivers his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of Red Fort, and escorts him back to his seat. But on Tuesday, Lt Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane did not stand behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he delivered his speech. After escorting Modi to the dais, Naravane returned to his seat in the audience. At the end of the speech, Naravane got up to escort Modi back from the dais.

On August 15 last year, the then GOC, Delhi Area, Lt Gen Vijay Singh, stood behind Modi during his speech, but was shifted to a side so that he was not visible in the same frame as the Prime Minister.

Sources familiar with the matter told The Indian Express that during the rehearsals this year, the Special Protection Group (SPG) objected to the Lt Gen’s presence behind the Prime Minister, pointing out that he was not visible in the same frame last year. The Army objected, stating that the GOC, Delhi Area, has been a constant presence behind the Prime Minister at all such Independence Day speeches.

The issue was discussed in the Ministry of Defence (MoD), where a decision was taken to defer to the decision of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The Army then decided that the Lt General would only escort the Prime Minister to and from the dais. Both the Army and MoD refused to comment on the matter. On reports that the protocol had been amended this year, government sources told The Indian Express that there is no protocol for the event, and it is only a practice that is followed during the ceremony.

238,"&gt;A statesman is one who admits when he has made a mistake and has the grace to correct it before it does any more harm. The prime minister, unfortunately, has shown no signs of having either of these virtues.

[Fact check: From LPG subsidies to maternity leave, comparing Modi’s I-Day claims with the data](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6tzyuy/fact_check_from_lpg_subsidies_to_maternity_leave/)

&gt;In 1967, the Congress had required 40.7% of the vote to win 282 seats. In 2014, the BJP did it with under 31% of the vote. They will never, therefore, feel truly secure till they have captured that additional 10%.

&gt;Since that extra vote is not yet in sight, they have been following a two-pronged strategy to regain power in 2019. The first is to woo away the crucial 10% of the electorate by creating paranoia among caste Hindus in order to create a ‘Hindu’ identity as distinct from caste. 


&gt;The second is to ensure, by hook or by crook, that the opposition remains fragmented. To do this, the Modi-Shah duo launched a no-holds-barred campaign to destroy state-level parties like the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar and the Trinamool Congress in Bengal, that enjoy a measure of constitutional autonomy and therefore the capacity to form an alliance capable of defeating the BJP in 2019.

**Tejashwi Yadav demands CBI probe into Rs 1,000 cr Srijan scam** 

 ______ 
PATNA: Bihar's Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday demanded a CBI probe into the Rs 1,000 crore Srijan scam , in which government funds were transferred to private accounts between 2005 and 2013 when BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi was the Finance Minister.""It is high time that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recommend a CBI probe into Srijan scam as he has repeatedly been claiming zero tolerance against corruption,"" said Tejashwi Yadav, who is in Bhagalpur in connection with his ongoing Janadesh Apman Yatra.His father and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad also reiterated his demands for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe on Thursday.Tejashwi Yadav also said he has not been allowed to hold a meeting in Bhagalpur since Wednesday as the ""government is afraid"" that he will expose Srijan scam and the leaders behind it.He said Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi was the Finance minister when ""crores were looted from people. None but Modi is responsible for it"".Lalu Prasad, who is appearing before a CBI court in Ranchi in connection with fodder scam , said: ""Nitish Kumar should sack Modi immediately if he has zero tolerance against corruption, and arrest him. There are solid evidences of Modi's involvement in the scam.""Claiming that Sushil Kumar Modi is not the only senior BJP leader involved in the scam, he also alleged that other party leaders including MP Ashwani Kumar Choubey, Manoj Tiwari and former Union Minister Shahnawaz Hussain are also implicated.Urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take cognizance of the scam and order a CBI probe, he said the state government agency, probing the scam, is not reliable as Sushil Kumar Modi is involved in it.In Patna, senior RJD leader and former Minister Jagda Nand Singh said the party will launch an agitation if Nitish Kumar failed to recommend a CBI probe.""The state government should recommend a CBI probe within a week and RJD will not allow Nitish Kumar to save and protect some senior BJP leaders, including Modi, involved in it,"" he said.A public interest litigation was also filed in the Patna High Court on Wednesday by advocate Manibhusan Pratap, seeking a CBI probe into the scam.After days of investigation, a Special Investigation Team said crores were diverted from the bank accounts of different departments, including Mukhyamantri Shahari Vikas Yojna in Bhagalpur district, with the help of NGO Srijan Sahayog Mahila Vikas Samiti.So far, eight people have been arrested, including Prem Kumar, an aide of the Bhagalpur District Magistrate, in connection with the scam.SIT officials said an FIR was lodged against board members of the NGO and officials of Indian Bank in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 10.26 crore fund of the Mukhyamantri Shahari Vikas Yojana.Two more FIRs were lodged in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of funds of the Land Acquisition Department.

**Beyond buzzwords, where is PM Modi’s ‘new India’, writes Rajdeep Sardesai** 

 ______ 
One of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s great skills as a political communicator has been his ability to constantly summon up catchy buzzwords. If 2014 was the year of ‘acche din’, Make in India and Swachh Bharat, 2015 was about Start up and Stand up India, 2016 was Digital India and 2017 is now about ‘New India’. But shorn of the artful messaging, what does ‘New India’ really mean?”

Is it a ‘new India’ when over 70 ill-fated children tragically die in a Gorakhpur government hospital, an annual monsoon ritual in one of the more backward regions of the country? Is the prime minister assuring us that Japanese Encephalitis will be conquered, that public investment in health will be doubled, or that primary health centres will be strengthened? The truth is, the public health system in the country is in ICU.

Is it a ‘new India’ when Assam is flooded every year, when thousands are displaced in another annual catastrophe? Are we being assured that there will be a genuine effort to plug the encroachments of river banks, the lack of drainage, rampant deforestation, all of which contribute to the sorrows heaped upon hapless people by a swelling Brahmaputra?

Is it a ‘new India’ when government schools struggle to provide quality education to lakhs of students across the country? In a statement in parliament in December 2016, the HRD minister acknowledged that 18% teacher posts in government-run primary schools and 15% in secondary schools remain vacant. Is the government assuring an end to this acute teacher crisis in the immediate future?

Is it a ‘new’ India where agricultural land-holdings are shrinking, where small and marginal farmers remain indebted to village money-lenders, where deepening agrarian distress means that even in a year of a bountiful harvest, farmers denied a remunerative price commit suicide? Is it a ‘new’ India where the government is in denial on the reality of a manufacturing slowdown and jobless growth, especially in a post-demonetisation universe? A recent study of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) reveals that 1.5 million jobs were lost post-demonetisation in the first four months of 2017.

Is it a ‘new’ India where municipal authorities routinely fail to provide for pot-hole free roads, where every year dozens of citizens die in road accidents that could be avoided with better infrastructure and greater accountability? Is it a ‘new’ India where the backlog of cases continue to pile up in our courts, where the notion of speedy delivery of justice is a cruel joke being played on lakhs of petitioners?

Is it a ‘new’ India where fearful minorities are routinely subject to ‘patriotism’ tests, where sporting a cap and beard or eating beef, studying in a madarasa, reciting azaan or not singing Vande Mataram could provide automatic entry into the ‘anti-national’ club? Can a new India be built on ill-conceived cattle slaughter rules that only seem to encourage vigilante groups to flaunt their muscle against cattle traders? The fact is, as a recent report on data website India Spend points out, Muslims comprised 86% the 23 Indians killed in 63 cow lynching related incidents since 2010: 97% of these incidents were reported post May 2014.

Is it a ‘new’ India where the prime minister promises to end bureaucratic and political corruption but where ‘local’ corruption and red-tapism still haunts the average citizen: India still ranks a lowly 79 least corrupt nation out of 175 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. And if you believe ministerial corruption has ended, just travel to my home state of Goa where ‘rates’ for legislators switching sides to form a government are freely discussed.

Truth is, ‘new’ India is for now at least an undefined but alluring futuristic dream, one which is being strategically spun by a leader who knows that the promise of ‘acche din’ that won him the 2014 general elections could never match the vaulting expectations it threw up. Rather than being devoured by past hype, the prime minister is cleverly changing the goalposts by embarking on another feel-good journey to woo the gen-next voter. Which is why the ‘new’ India artifice is not offering instant gratification but sets a five year target of 2022 by which time another election will have, in all probability, also been won!

Post-script: Despite the ‘invented’ fantasy of a ‘new’ India, an India Today mood of the nation poll forecasts that the Modi-led alliance could win close to 350 seats if general elections were held now. Clearly, the hope of a better India embodied in the charismatic Modi persona is still attractive. Unless a divided and dispirited opposition carves out its own compelling counter-narrative.

**Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Amma... er Indira Canteen’ gaffe not the first. Read more here** 

 ______ 
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi is in the spotlight after he accidentally referred to the Karnataka government’s subsidised food served through Indira Canteen as Amma Canteen, a similar scheme run in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. In his speech, he also implied that Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, was a state.

“And soon, over the next couple of months, every single city in Bangalore, every single poor person in every single city in Bangalore will feel that in the state of Karnataka under Siddaramaih ji’s government I simply cannot go hungry,” he said inaugurating an Indira Canteen on Wednesday.

The Gandhi scion has made similar bloopers that were misconstrued or made fun of by his critics. Here are some examples:

“This morning, I got up at night.”

He made this comment in 2013 during a speech after being made the Congress’s vice president. Gandhi was referring to how his mother woke him up around 1am to share her fears about being in a position of power.

“Izzat ki aapki? Bhrashtachar kiya. Sorry, balatkaar kiya (Did they respect you? They indulged in corruption. Sorry, I meant they raped).”

He mixed up between the two Hindi words while addressing women at a rally in Madhya Pradesh. He was speaking on increasing crimes against women in the BJP-ruled state.

“Gujarat is bigger than UK. In fact, India is bigger than Europe and USA put together.”

It wasn’t clear if his point of comparison was on population or geography. He made the comments in Ahmedabad where he was telling party workers that Gujarat had the potential to be greater than it was under Narendra Modi as chief minister.

“Poverty is just a state of mind. It does not mean the scarcity of food, money or material things. If one possesses self-confidence, then one can overcome poverty.”

Gandhi was addressing people at a programme on poverty organised by social scientist Badri Narayan in Allahabad. Many saw the remarks as insensitive.

“We asked their minister about 2 crore jobs. Their minister replied that the government provided 1 lakh jobs. It means, in the entire nation, 1 lakh people didn’t get job.”

He said this at a farmers’ rally in July in Rajasthan. He probably meant that 199 lakh people did not get jobs that were promised by the Narendra Modi government.

**India is quietly preparing to end Chinese businesses' free run here** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India is tightening the rules for businesses entering its power transmission sector and making stringent checks on both power and telecoms equipment for malware — moves that government and industry officials say aim to check China 's advance into sensitive sectors.Chinese firms such as Harbin Electric, Dongfang Electronics, Shanghai Electric and Sifang Automation either supply equipment or manage power distribution networks in 18 cities in India.Local firms have long lobbied against Chinese involvement in the power sector, raising security concerns and saying they get no reciprocal access to Chinese markets.With India and China locked in their most serious military face-off in three decades, the effort to restrict Chinese business has gathered more support from within the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, worried about the possibility of a cyber attack.The Indian government is considering a report prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) that sets new conditions for firms bidding for power transmission contracts, tipping the scales in favour of local companies.According to an official involved in drafting the report, who asked not to be named, it says companies looking to invest in India should have been operating there for at least 10 years, have Indian citizens as top executives, and employees of the foreign firm should have lived in India for a certain period, the official said.Those companies have to detail where they procure the raw materials for transmission systems, and will be barred from further operations in India if their materials contain malware.Though the report makes no direct reference to China, the official said the recommendations are intended to deter China from making further headway in India, because of the security risks.CEA Chairman R.K. Verma said the possibility of a crippling cyber attack on India's power systems was a key consideration while drafting the policy. ""Cyber attacks are a challenge,"" he told Reuters.A representative of a Chinese enterprise engaged in exporting electric power equipment in India told China's state-run Global Times that India's industry has long tried to block foreign competition under the garb of safety issues.""Now, as Sino-Indian relations are getting intense, the old tune is on again. But in fact, it is unrealistic to completely ban China and India power investment cooperation. India will pay a huge price for this,"" the paper said.Shanghai Electric, Harbin Electric, Dongfang Electronics and state-run China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd, all involved in India or trying to enter, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the proposed Indian investment rules.TELECOMSThe Indian government is moving simultaneously on the telecoms sector, demanding higher security standards in an area dominated by Chinese makers of equipment and smartphones.In a letter reviewed by Reuters, the ministry of electronics and information technology has asked 21 smartphone makers, most of them Chinese, to provide details about the ""safety and security practices, architecture frameworks, guidelines, standards, etc followed in your product/services in the country.""Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, Vivo and Gionee together account for over half of India's $10 billion smartphone market. The letter, dated Aug. 12, was also sent to Apple, Samsung Electronics and local maker Micromax, a ministry source said.India has also privately raised objections to Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group's proposed $1.3 billion takeover of Indian drugmaker Gland Pharma, it emerged last month.""There's a lot of resentment against China for meddling in our internal affairs, supporting Pakistan's cross-border terrorism, and, on the other hand, posing a huge loss to our trade and industry each year,"" said Satish Kumar, national president of the Swadesh Jagran Manch, a right-wing nationalist group with ties to Modi's ruling party.The group has this year run a campaign asking Indians not to buy Chinese goods to protect local industry and reset a trade deficit of more than $51 billion.CHEAP GOODSIndia has used Chinese equipment for power generation and distribution as it looks to provide affordable electricity to an estimated 250 million people who are off the grid.China Southern Power Grid, in association with CLP India Pvt Ltd, is among Chinese firms bidding for power transmission lines, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament this month.Sunil Misra, director-general of the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association, said the new rules for power transmission would help local industry and were in line with the limited access China gives to foreigners in its market.Indian firms engaged in the power sector include Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Ltd and Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd.Security agencies have implemented a series of protocols and checks for Chinese equipment coming into the power sector, said another person involved in drafting the CEA report.""This is recent and happening quietly,"" he said.

The Congress on Wednesday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation figure he quoted during his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Tuesday. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad wondered how the Prime Minister quoted the cash amount recovered post-demonetisation when the Reserve Bank of India hasn’t finished counting yet. The Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad asked the PM how did he get the figures of Rs 3 lakh crore, when the Reserve Bank of India has not yet finished counting of the cash recovered post-demonetisation. According to news agency ANI, Azad said, “PM said Rs 3 Lakh crore came back to banking system post-demonetisation , RBI has not finished counting yet, how did PM get this figure?”

From the ramparts of the Red Fort, PM Modi addressed the nation on Tuesday hailing the note ban decision taken by his government to crack down on black money and corruption. He said, “According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs 3 lakh crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been brought into the system after demonetisation.” Meanwhile, India’s central bank is yet to issue details about the amount of cash which has returned to banks post-demonetisation announced on November 9, 2016 and is still busy counting.

Attacking the PM on his message of uniting India, the senior Congress leader said the PM is asking to unite India which is already united and instead he should tell people of RSS to not break India. Azad said, “PM keh rahe hain Bharat jodo, par Bharat pehle se hi juda hua hai, PM ko sangh ke logon se kehna chahiye ke Bharat mat todo. (PM is saying that India needs to Unite, when it is already united, PM should tell the people from Sangh that do not break India).”

Congress vice-president also attacked the Prime Minister on Wednesday on his fourth consecutive Independence Day speech cornering him on low employment rate in the country. Gandhi said, “The PM did not mention yesterday that India today has the highest rate of unemployment it has had in the last 8 years.”

**Despite PM's Order, 10% Of IAS, Police Officers Haven't Declared Assets** 

 ______ 
IAS and IPS officers who have not declared the assets previous year will be
denied vigilance clearances.

**New Delhi: **

Nearly a tenth of all civil servants and police officers in the country have
failed to declare their property details despite a clear directive of Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, risking the denial of promotions.

According to the estimates available with the Department of Personnel, as many
as 379 Indian Administrative Services or IAS officers (out of a total of
5,004) have not submitted details about their properties to the government.

Officers from Manipur-Tripura cadre top the list with 37 officers. Then come
officers from the Union Territory or UT Cadre with 34 and third in list are
officers from Andhra Pradesh.

As far as the Indian Police Services or IPS officers are concerned, the list
of defaulters is about 15 per cent.

In UT cadre alone, out of 255 officers, 221 have declared their property
details. Next in line are officers from Andhra Pradesh where out of 120
officers, only 104 have filed the details.

""The matter is very serious. We have been repeatedly advising and requesting
all officers to declare their assets with the government,"" a senior officer
told NDTV. The total strength of IPS officers in country is 4,000.

According to the government, officers who have not submitted their annual
property returns of the previous year will be denied vigilance clearance by
the central government.

Further, they will not be considered for empanelment for senior level posts in
the government as well as for deputation requiring the central government's
clearance for sensitive posts and assignment to training programmes.

**Doklam India-China standoff: Japan throws weight behind India, Bhutan** 

 ______ 
Doklam standoff: Japan’s unequivocal support to India and Bhutan is a first by a major country which is also China’s neighbour. Doklam standoff: Japan’s unequivocal support to India and Bhutan is a first by a major country which is also China’s neighbour.

Two months into the Doklam border standoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers, Japan has conveyed its unequivocal support to India and Bhutan through diplomatic channels — a first by a major country, which is China’s neighbour, top sources have told The Indian Express.

This comes a month ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit to India from September 13 to 15. The Indian Express has learnt that Japanese Ambassador to India Kenji Hiramatsu and his team of diplomats have conveyed Tokyo’s position to New Delhi and Thimphu in the last couple of weeks.

Hiramatsu, who is also concurrently accredited as Ambassador to Bhutan, met Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay in early August and conveyed Japan’s support to him and the top functionaries of the government.

Japanese diplomats, who have been in touch with Indian officials since late June, have been briefed by Indian and Bhutanese government functionaries on the situation in Doklam, and its complexities. They, South Block sources said, have met Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar and top officials in the Indian establishment. Sources said that they are one of the few diplomatic missions who have been briefed by Delhi on the border standoff.

Japan, which has been watching the situation “very closely”, feels that the ongoing stand-off can affect the stability of the entire region. Tokyo, which has had similar territorial disputes with China in the recent past, is of the view that in disputed areas, “all parties involved should not resort to unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force”. This is what Japan’s position has been — overtly critical of the Chinese attempt to “change the status quo.”

India had blamed Beijing for changing the status quo on June 30. Indeed, when contacted, Ambassador Hiramatsu told The Indian Express: “We understand that the standoff in the Doklam area has been ongoing for nearly two months…What is important in disputed areas is that all parties involved do not resort to unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force (but) resolve the dispute in a peaceful manner.”

South Block sources said that Japan itself has been at the receiving end of “Chinese expansionism” and it understands New Delhi’s position better than many. Government sources pointed out to Japan’s difficulties between 2012 and 2014, when ties between China and Japan were frayed by a territorial row over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.

Japan has also conveyed that they understand that the area is disputed between China and Bhutan and that both countries recognize the existence of a dispute. On China’s claim about India’s role in the dispute, Tokyo has also conveyed that India is “involved” in this incident “based on bilateral agreements” with Bhutan. They have lauded the Indian approach that New Delhi will continue to engage in a dialogue through diplomatic channels to find a “mutually acceptable solution”.

Sources said that Japan’s support comes when Chinese rhetoric has not abated and no major country has yet come out in support of India vis-a-vis China.

While the US has encouraged both India and China to sit down and have “direct dialogue”, UK has maintained that it is a bilateral issue. Australia has expressed concern over the possibility of “escalation of tensions” and has urged New Delhi and Beijing to resolve the issue peacefully to avoid “miscalculation” and “misjudgement”.

In the wake of such “neutral” statements by major players in the international community, Japan’s show of support has strongly reinforced Delhi’s arguments, government sources said.

Incidentally, Japan and Bhutan have had a very strong bilateral relationship over the last three decades. Thee have been three imperial visits from Japan to Bhutan: in 1987, 1997, and the last in June this year when when Princess Mako from the Japanese royal family visited Bhutan. The Bhutanese Royal couple also visited Japan and to Fukushima in November 2011 and the Bhutanese King had addressed the Japanese Parliament.

**Middlemen most unhappy with my govt: Prime Minister Narendra Modi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday expressed his ""unhappiness"" over the institutionalisation of corruption in the system of our country and promised more measures to ease the common man's problems.Addressing over 200 start-up entrepreneurs at 'Champions of Change' programme here, he said the government has already ended the systems of interviews for group III and IV employees in the government, ending the role of middlemen, who used to promise jobs for money.""It is unfortunate that corruption had become institutionalised. Till you make a counter institutional arrangement, you cannot stop it,"" Modi said at the event organised by Niti Aayog.He said as the middlemen are out of work now, they are the ones who are shouting the most about unemployment.Modi, who met the entrepreneurs twice in as may days, further said that only governments and their initiatives will not make a New India.""Change will be powered by each and every citizen of India,"" he stressed.Prodding young entrepreneurs to innovate and suggest solutions to deal with different issues, Modi said he would like Champions of Change event to be an annual feature.He said the different groups of entrepreneurs, which were set up to suggest policy initiatives, could be attached with the relevant ministries on a permanent basis.The Prime Minister said his government has taken numerous measures, like introducing self attestations of certificates and doing away with interviews for lower posts, to ease life of the common man.Referring to the Padma awards, Modi said that in past the prestigious awards were given on ministers' recommendation, but the government has now made it open to anyone for nomination.""Remember how Padma Awards were given earlier? We brought in a 'small' change - people can recommend names for awards, unlike the past,"" he said.Stressing that the government wants to work together with all citizens towards a New India, Modi said: Every one of us is equally patriotic and wants India to scale new heights of progress. There is no difference in our love for the nation"".(with PTI inputs)

WASHINGTON: Theis likely to reach India in the last week of September, opening new vistas in the Indo-US ties.With this India, the world's third-largest oil importer, joins Asian countries like South Korea, Japan and China to buy American crude after production cuts by OPEC drove up prices of Middle East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulphur content.""New breakthroughs!has started,"" the Indian Embassy in Washington tweeted yesterday after Indian Ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, handed over papers for the shipment to the Texas Governor Greg Abbott.The first lot of two million barrels costs $100 million, but given the volume being contemplated by Indian companies, this new development is expected to boost the bilateral oil trade to $2 billion.""Opening New Vistas in India US Co-opn,"" tweeted the Indian Embassy in Washington DC which also posted several pictures and a video of the event.Consignments of American crude oil left the US shores between August 6-14 and is likely to reach Paradip (Odisha) in the last week of September.While the 40-year-old ban on export of American oil was lifted by the then US President Barack Obama in December 2015, the real move started during the maiden meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump on June 26 when the two leaders agreed to deepen the engagement in the energy sector.Soon thereafter, Indian companies started purchasing crude from the US. Two Indian oil giants, Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum, placed orders for over four million barrels. The development was welcomed by Trump in his phone call with Modi.""In his call with Prime Minister Modi on Monday, President Trump welcomed the first-ever shipment of American crude oil to India, which will occur from Texas later this month,"" a State Department spokesperson told PTI.""The President pledged that the United States would continue to be a reliable, long-term supplier of energy,"" the spokesperson said in response to a question.""During the Prime Minister's June visit to the White House, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi committed to a comprehensive review of their trade relations with the goal of creating a fair and reciprocal trading relationship and removing obstacles to growth and jobs creation, including in the energy sector,"" the spokesperson added.The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd placed its first order in July and the second order on August 10. Bharat Petroleum Corp made its first purchase of US oil, buying high Sulphur crudes Mars and Poseidon. BPCL has bought a cargo containing 5,00,000 barrels each of Mars and Poseidon for delivery from September 26 to October 10. Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) is also looking at buying US crude oil.IOC Director (Finance) A K Sharma told PTI recently that buying US crude has become attractive for Indian refiners after the differential between Brent (the benchmark crude or marker crude that serves as a reference price for buyers in western world) and Dubai (which serves as a benchmark for countries in the east) has narrowed.Even after including the shipping cost, buying US crude is cost competitive to Indian refiners, he said.""We are not looking at any term (or fixed quantity) deal from US as of now. We will tender to buy crude and if the US crude is competitive as compared to others, we will buy it,"" he said.Over the next 20 years, India's energy consumption growth is projected to be the fastest among all major economies. And by 2035, China and India will have the largest share of global demand (35 per cent).While this is the first crude oil import from the US, Indian companies have made significant investment in purchasing energy assets in the United States. Four Indian public and private sector companies have invested approximately $ 5 billion in shale assets in the US.Indian companies have also contracted 9 MMTPA of LNG from the US and the first shipment is expected in Jan 2018. Of this, GAIL has contracted 5.8 MMT per annum, including 3.5 MMTPA of LNG from Sabine Pass Liquefaction terminal (Louisiana) and 2.3 MMTPA from Cove Point LNG liquefaction project (Maryland).In a tweet a day earlier, Senator Ted Cruz said Texas will provide crucial oil exports to India and serve as a reliable long-term supplier of energy.In a certificate issued to Sarna on the occasion, the Texas Governor said in the decades to come ""this relationship will continue to be one of the world's most significant"" as the United States and India work toward common goals of prosperity, strength and peace.""As a top exporter to India with over $ 2 billion annually in exports and as the nation's leader in crude oil reserve and production, Texas looks forward to our growing relationship with India,"" Abbott said.

**Taking aim at China, India tightens power grid, telecom rules** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India is tightening the rules for businesses entering its power transmission sector and making stringent checks on both power and telecom equipment for malware - moves that government and industry officials say aim to check China 's advance into sensitive sectors.Chinese firms such as Harbin Electric, Dongfang Electronics, Shanghai Electric and Sifang Automation either supply equipment or manage power distribution networks in 18 cities in India.Local firms have long lobbied against Chinese involvement in the power sector, raising security concerns and saying they get no reciprocal access to Chinese markets.With India and China locked in their most serious military face-off in three decades, the effort to restrict Chinese business has gathered more support from within the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , worried about the possibility of a cyber attack.The Indian government is considering a report prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) that sets new conditions for firms bidding for power transmission contracts, tipping the scales in favour of local companies.According to an official involved in drafting the report, who asked not to be named, it says companies looking to invest in India should have been operating there for at least 10 years, have Indian citizens as top executives, and employees of the foreign firm should have lived in India for a certain period, the official said.Those companies have to detail where they procure the raw materials for transmission systems, and will be barred from further operations in India if their materials contain malware.Though the report makes no direct reference to China, the official said the recommendations are intended to deter China from making further headway in India, because of the security risks.CEA Chairman R.K. Verma said the possibility of a crippling cyber attack on India's power systems was a key consideration while drafting the policy. ""Cyber attacks are a challenge,"" he told Reuters.A representative of a Chinese enterprise engaged in exporting electric power equipment in India told China's state-run Global Times that India's industry has long tried to block foreign competition under the garb of safety issues.""Now, as Sino-Indian relations are getting intense, the old tune is on again. But in fact, it is unrealistic to completely ban China and India power investment cooperation. India will pay a huge price for this,"" the paper said.Shanghai Electric, Harbin Electric, Dongfang Electronics and state-run China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd, all involved in India or trying to enter, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the proposed Indian investment rules.The Indian government is moving simultaneously on the telecoms sector, demanding higher security standards in an area dominated by Chinese makers of equipment and smartphones.In a letter reviewed by Reuters, the ministry of electronics and information technology has asked 21 smartphone makers, most of them Chinese, to provide details about the ""safety and security practices, architecture frameworks, guidelines, standards, etc followed in your product/services in the country.""Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi, Lenovo, Oppo, Vivo and Gionee together account for over half of India's $10 billion smartphone market. The letter, dated Aug. 12, was also sent to Apple, Samsung Electronics and local maker Micromax, a ministry source said.India has also privately raised objections to Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group's proposed $1.3 billion takeover of Indian drugmaker Gland Pharma, it emerged last month.""There's a lot of resentment against China for meddling in our internal affairs, supporting Pakistan's cross-border terrorism, and, on the other hand, posing a huge loss to our trade and industry each year,"" said Satish Kumar, national president of the Swadesh Jagran Manch, a right-wing nationalist group with ties to Modi's ruling party.The group has this year run a campaign asking Indians not to buy Chinese goods to protect local industry and reset a trade deficit of more than $51 billion.India has used Chinese equipment for power generation and distribution as it looks to provide affordable electricity to an estimated 250 million people who are off the grid.China Southern Power Grid, in association with CLP India Pvt Ltd, is among Chinese firms bidding for power transmission lines, Power Minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament this month.Sunil Misra, director-general of the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association, said the new rules for power transmission would help local industry and were in line with the limited access China gives to foreigners in its market.Indian firms engaged in the power sector include Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Ltd and Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd.Security agencies have implemented a series of protocols and checks for Chinese equipment coming into the power sector, said another person involved in drafting the CEA report.""This is recent and happening quietly,"" he said.

Talking about moving to another place, have you seen the queue made by patriots in front of the US embassy from 4.30 in the morning in Mumbai to get a visa? Have you seen the joy among patriots when they get a green card there? They distribute Laddu in the biradari. That's what Indians do when they somehow manage to get out of that land. Have you thought why Indians go abroad for higher education? Have you thought why all these bigshot CEOs of IT companies like Microsoft, Google are in USA, instead of in India? Do you understand why Narendra Modi makes sure that he meets the NRIs in foreign countries than meet the people of his own country in his own country? It is good to be optimistic, but it better to be a realist. India is not going to change. It cannot. There are too many hurdles but the biggest hurdle in India's progress is the jingoist and largely uneducated population of India. Considering the dilapidated state of Indian education, it is impossible to progress. It is much easier to regress and that is what India is doing now with great efficiency.  Forget it! Now you worship cow, promote gobar and gomutra. Soon you will be marrying and copulating with cows. This is the future of India, unless something really different happens that changes the mindset of the people in that country.

**Priyanka Chopra, Why No Sari? Actress Trolled For Independence Day Post** 

 ______

priyankachopra)

**New Delhi: **

It seems like Priyanka Chopra will have to resign herself to being roundly
trolled no matter what she wears - for the second time in months, the 35-year-
old actress has been derided online for her choice of outfit, worn this time
in a boomerang video she posted on Independence Day. Priyanka, who was in the
US on August 15, wore a tricolour

_dupatta_

with her T-shirt in the video - this has been received with disfavour by a
section of her Instagram followers who accused her of disrespecting the flag,
told her she should have worn more traditional clothing, and suggested she
remain in the US instead of coming home.

""Please don't return to India again,"" Priyanka Chopra was told in the
comments. ""Don't you have a

_salwar-kameez_

for this occasion?"" asked one follower.

How about a sari, said another

\- ""At least on this auspicious day, you were expected in a sari."" Priyanka is
currently Mumbai-bound, as she revealed in a new Instagram post.

On August 15, Priyanka Chopra shared the video with tags like
""MyHeartBelongsToIndia"" and ""JaiHind."" Trolls responded with comments like:
""What nonsense. National flag, have certain respect"" and ""This is not your
dupatta stupid, show some respect."" As always, the more sensible of Priyanka's
fans have taken up cudgels on behalf of the actress while a response is
awaited (or not) in typical Priyanka Chopra fashion.

&gt; Not too long ago, Priyanka Chopra

was shamed online for wearing a dress

that revealed her knees at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in
Berlin - both happened to be in Germany on work. ""Priyanka, you were sitting
with the Prime Minister of our country. You should have at least had the basic
sense of covering your legs,"" read a comment on the pic she Instagrammed.

&gt; Other actresses have been similarly shamed for their outfits recently, among
them Deepika Padukone, Soha Ali Khan, Sunny Leone and Fatima Sana Shaikh.

Esha Gupta trended for days

after posting provocative pictures from a photoshoot, later responding to the
trolling defiantly. ""It's my body,"" she told

Miss Kyra

.

Priyanka Chopra has also been trolled for the way she looks and was

accused of having her lips done earlier this year

.

&gt; Priyanka Chopra is all set to make a comeback on American TV with her
popular series

_Quantico 3_

. She made her Hollywood debut with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's

_Baywatch_

and is working on two more projects -

_Isn't It Romantic_

and

_A Kid Like Jake_

.

Meanwhile,

mid-day

reported that Priyanka is returning to India to finalise the lead actor for
her upcoming film

_Gustakhiyan_

, to be directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. However, an official announcement
about her upcoming projects in Bollywood is still awaited.

**Bihar floods: 119 dead; bridge collapse caught on camera** 

 ______ 
PATNA: The flood situation in Bihar worsened on Thursday as the death toll mounted to 119 due to the deluge, which has affected nearly 98 lakh people in 16 districts, forcing postponement of examination and cancellation of trains.A video shot by some locals caught three persons stranded in floods falling into an overflowing river after a bridge collapsed in Araria district. The video first shows the river uprooting a huge tree and carrying it away with the flow and later destroying the bridge that was being used by the locals to cross the river.The toll due to the floods triggered by rains in Nepal and northern parts of the state was 72 on Wednesday, and 73.44 lakh people in 14 districts were hit.Saharsa and Khagaria were the latest districts to be affected during the day, Special Secretary in the Disaster Management Department, Anirudh Kumar, said.Araria district accounted for 23 deaths, followed by Sitamarhi (12), Kisanganj, East Champaran, West Champaran and Supual (11 each), Madhubani and Katihar (7 each), Madhepura and Purnea (5 each), Darbhanga and Saharsa (4 each), Gopalganj and Khagaria (3 each) and Sheohar (2), he said.The health department has launched a toll-free number '104' to provide information on floods, Principal Secretary of Health R K Mahajan at the press briefing said. He was accompanied by Principal Secretary State Disaster Management Department Pratyay Amrit.Though the Met office has forecast possibility of rain in southern Bihar for one more week, there would be less rainfall in Nepal and northern parts of Bihar.Mahajan said hospitals have been directed to maintain a sufficient stock of anti-snake and anti-rabies injections.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar accompanied by his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi and Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh conducted an aerial survey of Gopalganj, Bagha, Bettiah in West Champaran, and Raxual and Motihari in East Champaran.The chief minister took feed back about flood relief operation in West Champaran from officials at Bettiah helipad and inspected a place where food packets were being readied, an official release said.Following the chief minister's order, district magistrates of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Darbhanga, Madhubani, West Champaran and East Champaran also conducted aerial surveys in their areas.Amrit said that 3.59 lakh people have been rescued to safer places.

**Amit Shah's Unfolded 'Mission 350' For 2019. How It Will Work** 

 ______ 
Ahmed Patel, victor of the grudge match with the normally unstoppable Amit
Shah said yesterday, ""Only two men are running the country"" in a reference to
his

_bête noire_

who chiefs the BJP. Patel, who is political secretary to Congress president
Sonia Gandhi, said this at the 16-party opposition meeting as a way of urging
others to end the monopoly of power.

Simultaneously, at a parallel meeting, Shah was instructing 30 senior BJP
senior leaders including several union ministers on how to win 2019 with
immediate steps to increase the voter base of the party. As that happens,
expect a rise in communal temperatures as the BJP uses its patented brand of
minority-baiting to grow its political base.

While the opposition was delighted at the outcome of the West Bengal civic
election where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee swept the civic elections
yesterday, winning 140 out of 148 wards, the BJP was a distant second - the
gap was uncomfortably large for Shah, who has pledged to intercept Mamata in
Bengal, but the six seats the party won would have been unimaginable even two
years ago. The Congress drew a blank and the Left Front got a single seat,
establishing that the BJP is quickly growing into the main challenger in
Bengal.

Mamata Banerjee's TMC won all seven urban local bodies for which polls were
held on Sunday; the BJP finished a distant second (File photo)

While the results may have been less impressive than Shah is used to, he
rolled out at his meeting in Delhi what's being called Mission 350+ for 2019.
The last general election was fought by the BJP pronouncing Mission 272. Shah
is demanding a major expansion.

He told core members of the BJP including eight ministers that they need to
focus on new catchment areas for the BJP including 150 new seats across West
Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka and Kerala. Even Tamil Nadu is on Shah's radar - he
wants the BJP to benefit, possibly piggyback, on the merger of the two
factions of Jayalalithaa's AIADMK with a high-profile role for superstar
Rajinikanth, who has made it clear that he's finally crossing the threshold to
become a politician.

The expansion of the BJP in the thus far impenetrable citadel of Tamil Nadu is
being personally handled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - hence the frequent
cosy meetings with EPS and OPS, the leaders of the two wings of the AIADMK who
appear to be closing the deal for their reconciliation.

In other states especially Kerala and Bengal, the BJP will rely heavily on its
tried and tested communal agenda, inciting or exacerbating Hindi-Muslim unrest
with pro-BJP media and daily hashtags propagating a carefully-crafted
narrative spun by BJP Central.

On superstar Rajinikanth joining politics, BJP chief Amit Shah had said ""all
good people are welcome""

Shah, with his grasp of real politiks, is aware that the BJP has approached
saturation point in the North - it would be tough, for example, to beat the
2014 catch of 73 parliamentary seats in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP has wiped the
floor with the Congress which now barely rules six percent of India's
population and does not exist in the north except in Punjab. Yet, voter
fatigue is apparent in Madhya Pradesh where the Congress won three seats
yesterday in the by-poll of the Mandsaur district, where seven farmers died in
police firing in June this year. Despite the BJP winning the rest of the civic
elections, Shah is rushing to take stock of Madhya Pradesh. Sources say he's
well aware of the anti-incumbency that the party must contend with after 20
years of governing the state. Similarly, Rajasthan and Haryana have hardly
been shining examples of ""good governance"" with the BJP government's not
really on a winning streak with voters. In Maharashtra, where Chief Minister
Devendra Fadnavis delivered strong results in civic elections but is seen as
having mishandled farmer distress, Shah is managing the situation by tacitly
coopting Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Pawar, an
astute political weather vane, is now in an unannounced alliance with the BJP.

Shah told the party yesterday that in Bihar, the BJP with allies won 32 of 40
seats in 2014; with Nitish Kumar now appropriated as a partner, the state is
safe. Gujarat, despite Shah's declaration of Mission 150 and the effective
split in the Congress in still not entirely in the bag, so Modi will make
nearly weekly trips till the state votes for its next government.

All ministers have been tasked with delivering a cluster of five Lok Sabha
seats each. Flush with record funds (nearly 74 percent of corporate donations
from known sources, around Rs 768 crores, as revealed by the Association of
Democratic Reforms), the BJP has commissioned three different agencies to
carry out near-weekly pan-India surveys. This apart, the party is also
habitually conducting informal surveys monitored by Finance Minister Arun
Jaitley.

BJP President Amit Shah has set a target of 350+ seats for the party in the
next Lok Sabha elections

Shah has very quickly and effectively annexed new terrain in the North East
without the bother of winning elections - like in Manipur. The party breaks
the Congress, then supports the spin-off group all the way into power. The
BJP's rising graph in the North East is directly attributable to Himanta
Biswas Sarma who defected from the Congress and first delivered the prize of
Assam. Some clever shenanigans ensured that the BJP also formed the government
in Arunachal Pradesh.

The big question in this push for new electoral space is how the BJP will
reconcile its agenda with popular mood-such as its insistence on Hindi being
the national language, widely opposed in the South, or the forcing of a strict
anti-beef ban in Kerala, West Bengal and the North East, where beef is an
important part of both diet and culinary culture.

So far the party has just tried to finesse the contradictions and dichotomy -
but it cannot gloss over the problems indefinitely. A senior Congress leader
who asked not to be named, said ""Shah keeps talking of a

_Congress-mukt Bharat_

, but all that he has done is transform the BJP into a more aggressive and
electorally successful Congress."" The problem is that the Congress, even now,
doesn't see the flaw in its defense, dismissing the success rate and the
indefatigable fighting spirit of Modi-Shah as something it could own, if it
wanted to. Any day now.

**Path to India reforms eased as PM Narendra Modi turns enemies into friends**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ability to turn enemies into allies is expected to help kick start controversial labor and land reforms as he expands his authority over the majority of India’s states.With Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party back in power in the key eastern state of Bihar, the federal ruling coalition now controls 18 of 29 states, which represents 60 percent of the country’s gross domestic product . It’s also expanding its base in Karnataka and luring lawmakers from the rival Congress party in Gujarat, where state assembly elections are set to be held in December.The BJP’s National Democratic Alliance is expected to increase its strength in the upcoming polls, allowing Modi “to work across much of India with friendly state governments to accelerate the implementation of key national economic policies such as accelerated infrastructure development, labor law reforms, energy reforms and smart cities roll out,” said Rajiv Biswas, Singapore-based Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.“Key proposed federal legislation on industrial relations and improving maternity and social security benefits can be gradually rolled out by friendly NDA state governments even if the federal legislation faces hurdles in the upper house,” said Biswas.Since he came to power in May 2014, Modi has led the BJP to state election victories and expanded the party’s base. Among the big states he failed to capture were Bihar and West Bengal. But in a surprise political maneuver last week, Modi renewed his ties with regional party leader Nitish Kumar , who was regarded as a potential rival to him in national elections due in 2019.""Nobody can compete with Narendra Modi ,"" Kumar said on Monday, expressing confidence the prime minister would win a second term in office. Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) party severed its alliance with the BJP-led coalition in June 2013, only to join hands again with the BJP to reclaim government in Bihar.“The re-alignment of the BJP and Janata Dal (United) should give a solid boost to economic development, both nationally as well as within Bihar itself,” said Richard Rossow, an India specialist at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.The renewed alliance and the BJP’s expected gain in the August 8 upper house elections will increase the ruling coalition’s strength, although it will still be short of a majority there.“With the BJP now looking in a strong position to win a second term of office, if the NDA can achieve a working majority in the upper house early in Modi’s second term of office, this will allow the Modi government to push ahead with more rapid economic reforms,” said Biswas.To give a momentum to the labor reform process, Modi’s government is likely to introduce a bill in the current parliament session that ends on August 11. The bill, which will seek to consolidate a clutch of wage-related labor laws and ensure a minimum wage across all sectors, was approved by cabinet last week.Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office, didn’t return calls seeking comment.By accelerating federal and state level regulatory reforms, the Modi government may be able to improve India’s international ease of doing business ranking, said Biswas. India is currently ranked 130 out of 190 countries by the World Bank States like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have already taken steps to simplify rules on land and labor. Yet the move to make it easier for companies to acquire land and hire and fire workers has been stymied at the federal level by a strong opposition as well as concerns from trade unions and farmers’ groups.The increasing political strength of BJP and allies “should bode well over the coming years for reforms at both the central and state level,” Vishal Vaibhaw, Nupur Gupta and Andrew Tilton, researchers for Goldman Sachs, said in a July 28 report. “That said, the likelihood of the introduction in the upper house of any major reforms -– such as amendments to land or labor legislation –- in 2018 appears low. We expect that the central government may continue to rely on state governments to carry out these reforms.”India’s states have operated almost as separate countries. They set their own taxes, provide most basic amenities critical for development, including electricity, water, sanitation, law and order, and health care. Getting states to reform and attract business is critical for India’s overall development.The July 1 implementation of the national sales tax, which rolled more than a dozen levies into a goods and sales tax is an illustration of Modi securing the cooperation of states to push the decade-long pending indirect tax reform.Provinces ruled by the BJP and its allies are leading the way with reforms, said Rossow. There’s been ""real changes in the balance of power between the central government and state governments, which is a very positive development.”

Well unless the Govt authority who verifies the signature allows it, there is no point in making a new service, free or otherwise. They will only accept certs issued by CAs authorised by [CCA](http://www.cca.gov.in/cca/) - i.e. the CA's cert itself has to be issued by CCA like EMudhra, Sify, Capricon , nCode etc. These guys pay money to the Govt to be able to issue certs which are trusted by the Govt.

Didn't Modi say 3 years back that no attesting other than self-attesting is required? It looks like Modi has some good ideas but he doesn't seem to follow up on them.   

The Govt still makes it mandatory for attestation.

**Middlemen most unhappy with my govt: PM Modi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday expressed his ""unhappiness"" over the institutionalisation of corruption in the system of our country and promised more measures to ease the common man's problems.Addressing over 200 start-up entrepreneurs at 'Champions of Change' programme here, he said the government has already ended the systems of interviews for group III and IV employees in the government, ending the role of middlemen, who used to promise jobs for money.""It is unfortunate that corruption had become institutionalised. Till you make a counter institutional arrangement, you cannot stop it,"" Modi said at the event organised by Niti Aayog.He said as the middlemen are out of work now, they are the ones who are shouting the most about unemployment.Modi, who met the entrepreneurs twice in as may days, further said that only governments and their initiatives will not make a New India.""Change will be powered by each and every citizen of India,"" he stressed.Prodding young entrepreneurs to innovate and suggest solutions to deal with different issues, Modi said he would like Champions of Change event to be an annual feature.He said the different groups of entrepreneurs, which were set up to suggest policy initiatives, could be attached with the relevant ministries on a permanent basis.The Prime Minister said his government has taken numerous measures, like introducing self attestations of certificates and doing away with interviews for lower posts, to ease life of the common man.Referring to the Padma awards, Modi said that in past the prestigious awards were given on ministers' recommendation, but the government has now made it open to anyone for nomination.""Remember how Padma Awards were given earlier? We brought in a 'small' change - people can recommend names for awards, unlike the past,"" he said.Stressing that the government wants to work together with all citizens towards a New India, Modi said: Every one of us is equally patriotic and wants India to scale new heights of progress. There is no difference in our love for the nation"".(with PTI inputs)

**Kill the guys, keep the girl: JNU, St Stephens students allege assault, rape attempt by mob in Faridabad** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Mob allegedly assaults group of JNU, St Stephen's students.

2 Students claim the mob hurled communal slogans at them.

3 Police initially refused to register an FIR, the students said.

Seven students of JNU and St Stephen's College, including a girl, were brutally assaulted by a group of people in Faridabad on Monday, police said. The girl claims the group also tried to rape her during two-hour ordeal.

Moreover, when the victims approached Surajkund police station, cops misbehaved with them and refused to register an FIR.

The victims eventually went to Vasant Kunj north police station on August 15 where policemen registered a zero FIR under IPC section of 323, 341, 506, 354, 365, 511, 506 and 34 and transferred the case to Surajkund police station.

""I along with my friends had decided to explore the Bharadwaj Lake inside the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary. Around 8.30 pm, we decided to return. Three of us decided to go to the main road on my friend's bike while the other four started walking. Our cab was parked outside,"" the victim said in an FIR.

Suddenly, on the way, they were stopped by three persons, who asked what relation they have with the girl. They also asked the purpose of visiting that place, stated the complaint.

After replying to their questions, the students were suddenly attacked. ""The group grew bigger in no time and their accomplices joined them. All of them started assaulting the student with sticks. The mob constantly hurled communal abuses at them.""

""At this moment, they asked for our identity cards and broke our phones. They tried to grope my friend. The wounds inflicted on her were primarily on her chest, right abdomen, right breast, right leg and a knee. The intension of the accused was to kill us and gang-rape her,"" said another victim, adding, they were heard saying, ""Let's kill the guys and keep this girl with us.""

The victim, who belongs to minority community, said he was beaten up as he has a beard. ""I was mercilessly beaten up on my back and my right leg and upper torso and all three of us were stomped on our chest,"" he said, adding, ""We barely managed to save our lives. Two locals - Ashish and Sumit - helped us. We immediately went to Surajkund PS and tried to file in a complaint, but were promptly refused to do so.""

The cops questioned about her torn dress and said ""this is not a free-sex country"". The cops allegedly also forced them to write an apology letter.

When contacted, Astha Modi, DCP of NIT said: ""We have received zero FIR from Vasant Kunj police station Thursday. We have asked the victims to record their statements with us. We will recreate the sequence of event to establish the incident.""

**Nothing malafide; please engage in discussion: Activists to UIDAI CEO** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Anjali Bhardwaj, Nikhil Dey, Dipa Sinha and Amrita Johri, all activists or academics of some repute, on Thursday wrote to Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), expressing dismay over his response to their findings that the mandatory introduction of Aadhaar has caused large-scale exclusion of the most vulnerable to such social benefits as monthly rations from the Public Distribution System. The four activists sought that Pandey engage in a public discussion with them.The Narendra Modi government appears to have scant regard for accuracy of data it puts out. Questioning Prime Minister Modi's claims during his Independence Day address, The Telegraph of Kolkata wrote on Wednesday: ""It is not clear who estimated the quantum of post-demonetization black money deposits at Rs 2 lakh crore when the RBI has not yet counted the money and the tax-filing window for the financial year 2016-17 still remains open. The cash deposited can be characterized as black money only when these deposits are matched with tax filings.""The lackadaisical approach of the ruling dispensation even to matters that cause loss of life was evident when Amit Shah , president of India's ruling party, said in response to the death of over 100 children at a government hospital in Gorakhpur, ""In this big country, there have been many tragedies and this is not the first time.""On August 10, the media reported that Pandey found the activists acting out of ""malafide intent."" He said that the claim that Aadhaar was responsible for denial is ""misconstrued"".The four signatories to the letter, who represent Satark Nagrik Sanghatan, Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatan, Right to Food Campaign and Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikaar Abhiyan, had held a press conference on August 8 showing that there was no official data to back the claim made by PM Modi in Parliament on February 7 this year that nearly four crore bogus ration cards had been detected through use of technology and Aadhaar.Statistics from July 2017 on the website of the Food Department of Rajasthan showed there was a 33% exclusion from rations - only 67% of NFSA ration card holders were able to procure rations that month. A survey by IIT Delhi and Ranchi University students showed that quantity fraud, higher transaction costs and outright exclusion had occurred in the aftermath of the introduction of Aadhaar in the PDS in Jharkhand At the press conference, homeless people from Delhi offered testimonies to show that they have been unable to access ration entitlements since the introduction of Aadhaar. Some of them had also filed affidavits in the Delhi high court.""We see it as our duty to put this information in the public domain and hope the government officials, such as yourself, will take cognizance and immediately find a remedy,"" the letter said. ""Unfortunately, you have been reported as questioning our presentation ... We would like to know what you base your comments upon, including having determined the malafide nature of our intent,"" the letter says, adding that evidence of Aadhaar-induced suffering was present in other parts of the country too, but the discussion was limited to Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Delhi because there were official statistics to back the findings in these states.Pandey had said that any denial of rations because of the inability to authenticate biometrics for Aadhaar was ""a violation of instructions"" and such violators would be punished. The letter writers say that even they would not know where to go in such a situation, and would like information on how many violators had been punished, and what the punishment was.The activists sought public discussion of this issue. ""We would appreciate if you would also invite us to the public discussion so we could present our findings. In any case we would like to organize a public dialogue which we would like to request you to attend,"" they said.

**Rahul Gandhis close aide Ashish Kulkarni calls Congress nepotist, feudal in resignation letter** 

 ______ 
Ashish Kulkarni, close aide of Rahul Gandhi and member of Congress coordination center has questioned the intentions behind the rumours of Priyanka Gandhi's inclusion as the working president of Congress.

While sending his resignation to Rahul Gandhi, Kulkarni stated that such rumours are being spread by party 'stalwarts' who couldn't find the reasons behind the party's rout in 2014 elections and are now trying to put the entire blame on Rahul Gandhi .

Terming these rumors 'disgusting,' Kulkarni wrote in the resignation letter that deliberate attempts are being made by the old guard to create a perception of lack of confidence in Rahul Gandhi's leadership.

Ashish, who has been associated with the congress coordination committee (war room) since 2009 has raised many questions regarding the current situation in the party.

In his 3-page letter to Rahul Gandhi he writes, ""We have not been able to create depth of management in the party. Party's indecisiveness in Maharashtra, Assam, Goa, Arunachal and Uttharakhand has led to defeat and now it is been repeated in Himachal and Gujarat.""

Questioning the party's stand over issues like Kashmir and JNU, Ashish has pointed out party's shift from a centrist position in the ideology. ""Party has moved towards left, sympathizing with ultra left, Kashmiri separatist.""

In the letter, Ashish has also been upfront about Congress's lack of agenda saying that the party has distanced itself from the grass root reality of India and has failed to address the changes in the scenario.

He also points out that there is no discussion on key economic issues, foreign policies and development and that the party's narrative as an opposition party is not appealing to voters.

In the end, he has held the old guard responsible for chaos in the party stating that Rahul Gandhi's efforts to bring in changes and the inner party democracy has failed. ""Only the privileged or those with money power are getting preferences. Congress remains to be nepotistic and a feudal party, which is a tragedy for Congress,"" says the letter in its conclusion.

Congress hasn't reacted yet on the issues raised by Kulkarni.

328,"Yes, I do. As do most businessmen who understand how money works, have black money of their own, yet still want the government to rid them of having to deal with black money. 

Black money is part of a well established cycle in India, and no one move, no matter how audacious, can eradicate it. But that does not mean that you don't try anything. 

If the Modi government had just done demonetisation and nothing else, the business community would have deserted its side en masse, because it (more than any other) understands the limited scope of black money it dealt with, and how easy it was for most hoarders to minimise its impact. 

But anyone who does not have thick blindfolds over their eyes, who'd sooner hand the country over to bumbling idiots like Rahul Gandhi or scheming conspiracists like Arvind Kejriwal (heck, you'd sooner side with Lalu Yadav than Narendra Modi!), can see that Modi is doing a whole lot more. 

For all the sensitive privacy related issues, which are genuinely troublesome and I'm glad are being brought up vociferously, the Aadhar linkage with PAN cards and almost everything else, the much stricter KYC norms, UPI, GST, the thousands of raids being conducted all over the country, increased transparency and reduced corruption in awarding government contracts, clamping down on terror finding, and following the money trail of hoarders identified by demonetisation are all steps the public wanted to see taken, and the BJP deserves credit for taking them. 

Demonetisation failed in many crucial ways, and I wish it hadn't. But even so, it was a step in the right direction and taken with the right intent, and it sent a strong signal across the country that the prime minister meant business. 

If it helped the BJP win UP, as you suggest, more power to them, I say. I wish the opposition were competent enough to give it good competition and make it seat for its victories, but given the news that Mr. Gandhi is being elevated to the post of Congress president, I think that's going to remain a pipe dream for now.

**India runs on Constitution, not on shariat; triple talaq should be outlawed: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Naqvi called triple talaq a social evil.

2 He said it infringes upon the right to equality to women.

3 He added that Modi govt is committed to make the poor prosper.

Union Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Friday he wants the controversial practice of triple talaq to be abolished as it infringes upon the right to equality of women and puts them at a severe disadvantage. Naqvi was speaking at the first edition Mail Today's Femail Summit, a conclave dedicated to the women of the nation.

The triple talaq is a Sharia law practice which allows men to end a marriage, simply by saying ""talaq"" to their wives three times in succession.

While many Muslim-majority countries such as Pakistan and Indonesia have outlawed the custom for years, India- home to the world's third-largest Muslim population- continues to allow it. The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of petitions opposing triple talaq, after women complained that they had been divorced via Facebook and WhatsApp. ""I am not a talaq specialist. I have never done talaq and I don't intend to do it ever,"" Naqvi said in a light-hearted way to begin with, coming to the more serious aspects of the instant divorce custom that the Narendra Modi government has promised to do away with, an attitude that has caused consternation among the more conservative sections of Muslim society and the clerics in particular.

Several political observers have pointed out that the BJP garnered a massive chunk of votes from Muslim women that, among other things, accounted for its sweeping majority in the UP Assembly polls this year. ""Our Constitution guarantees gender equality and a sweeping equality for all: high and low, man and woman. This right to equality must be held sacrosanct for all and all must respect it. This nation runs on a Constitution, not on shariat or any other religious textbook. This practice is inhuman, unconstitutional and is a social evil,"" Naqvi said.

'TRIPLE TALAQ, A SOCIAL EVIL'

The senior minister of the Modi council, who has held several party positions too in the past, put forth before the audience a kind of ""secular"" argument in favour of the abolition of this ""social evil"" as he called it. ""This country has not seen socio-religious reforms for the first time. Child marriage was abolished. Even then naysayers had cried 'religion in danger' and that it was tinkering with the religious sentiments of the people. They said it must not be abolished as it was part of established tradition dating back to hundreds of years, but it happened. Similarly, when sati was abolished, a section said it was an attack on religious sentiments of people. A big campaign too was launched against the move, but it was made illegal. In the same way, triple talaq too must be abolished and a positive step should be taken towards social reform.""

The national Law Commission last year sought public views on whether to abolish the custom, triggering a debate between politicians and religious leaders. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), a non-governmental body which oversees the application of Muslim personal law, has resisted any ban on triple talaq while arguing that this is a religious matter and not for the courts. Naqvi also made a strong pitch for reservation for women in educational institutions.

""We are in the process of opening nearly 100 schools on the lines of 'Navodaya Vidyalayas' across the nation for minorities where 50 per cent of the seats would be reserved for girls. Of all the scholarships given by my ministry, we have reserved 40 per cent for the girl child. We have ensured that all skilling programmes that we run, through NGOs or as government enterprise, have at least 40 per cent of participation from women. There are schemes in which minorities have 75 per cent job reservation and we have ensured that 50 per cent of these go to women."" Talking about the skilling initiatives of the ministry, Naqvi said the motto was Madad Hamari, Manzil Aapki (our help, your ambition).

""In the past three years we have tried for bringing about empowerment without appeasement as the Narendra Modi government is committed to bring happiness and prosperity for everyone who is poor. The next motto is Education, Employment and Empowerment. This is what we are doing and intend to further do for mainstreaming the minorities in India.""

But just because the average citizen isn't fundamentally cynical and suspicious of Modi does not mean that they are stupid. They realise that he's the best option India has right now, and for all the bluster, there's also real work being done on the ground. 

I don't have the time to cite individual references here, because it's almost 9 AM and I have to reach my office by 9:30, where I'll forget this discussion for the rest of the day because I have other things to do, just like every other person in this country. 

That may sound like escapism to you. It may sound like my trying to justify my inability to prove my point. But you are not there to point this out to them when my parents and neighbours are having conversations in the real world and they make these same claims based on the same assumptions without an iota of verifiable evidence. 

Ultimately, with a clearly biased media on both sides and every politician lying through their teeth and no easy way to judge what the truth is, everyone has to rely on their gut feeling. And it says that Modi is the best thing to happen to this country in a long time. 

Give us a better candidate and we'll vote for them, but until then, Narendra Modi is where it's at. ",2017-08-19 08:39:40

NEW DELHI: India and the US are scheduling the first meeting of the newly established ""2+2"" format, of the defence and foreign ministers from each side. This new high-level mechanism will be in addition to the strategic and commercial dialogue that is an annual feature between the two countries.The new high-level dialogue mechanism was confirmed during a conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump on Independence Day. A readout of the conversation said, ""The leaders resolved toby establishing a new 2-by-2 ministerial dialogue that will elevate their strategic consultations.""During the Obama years, the India-US dialogue mechanism included the secretaries of state and commerce, which was then the focus of the relationship. But commerce and trade have always been the weak links of the relationship, while defence and strategic affairs have dominated the bilateral landscape. Officials said the US-India dialogue mechanism was only following the format of US talks with Japan, China and even Australia.Afterin July and the first shipment of oil from the US to India, the two sides are now preparing for the three-day Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, likely to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with US President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump leading the US delegation.With a long list of CEOs quitting, there is a question about whether some of these companies, which have a big presence in India, would be part of the US delegation. Some CEOs have confirmed that they would not let their decision to quit Trump's councils come in the way.""Look forward to Ivanka Trump's presence at GES 2017 Hyderabad as the leader of the US delegation,"" Modi had said in a tweet last week. He said the event was aimed at bringing together entrepreneurs of the two countries. ""Honoured to lead the US delegation to GES2017 in India and meet with Prime Minister Modi and passionate entrepreneurs from around the globe!"" Ivanka had tweeted.The theme of the summit is 'Women F irst, Prosperity for All', highlighting the critical role women play in fostering global growth and prosperity. The focus sectors of the GES include energy and infrastructure; healthcare and life sciences; financial technology in digital economy; media and entrepreneurship and possibly, agricultural entrepreneurship.Other than the US, the GES has been held earlier in Morocco, Kenya, the UAE, Malaysia and Turkey. This is the first time that the event is being held in India.

**Sale Of Drones Worth $2 Billion To 'Cement' India-US Bilateral Ties**

A US MQ-9 Reaper drone sits armed with Hellfire missiles and a 500-pound bomb

**Washington: **

The US decision to sell 22 Sea Guardian drones to India at an estimated cost
of USD 2 billion will create around 2,000 jobs in the US and ""cement""
bilateral ties, an American executive involved in the deal has said.

""This should be viewed as a significant step in cementing the US-India
bilateral defence relationship,"" Vivek Lall, chief executive US and
international strategic development, General Atomics, told the Atlantic
Council yesterday.

Mr Lall echoed Senator John Cornyn, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, who
tweeted, ""Drone Sale Would Cement US-India Ties.""

The announcement in this regard was made by Trump in June when he met Prime
Minister Narendra Modi at the White House. This prospective purchase of drones
manufactured by General Atomics marks the first of its kind from the US by a
country that is not a member of the NATO, Mr Lall said.

With China focused on South China Sea, Mr Lall hopes that India has an
opportunity to help create and lead a regional balance of power to protect its
interests in the Indian Ocean region by building maritime engagements with
regional and extra-regional partners.

The Sea Guardian is a variant of the tested MQ-9 platform which allows for
greater interoperability with the US and allied forces, in a way other
platforms do not permit demonstrating the centrality of General Atomics'
products to India's defence needs, he said.

""This platform has 4 million hours in combat, will be able to certifiably fly
in Indian civilian airspace and can remain airborne more than a record setting
forty hours.

Additionally, it has a 40,000-hour design life demonstrating its unique
resilience. General Atomics maintains that this platform and its proven
performance stands independently of and is unaffected by Israel's Heron sales
to India,"" he said.

This summer, India received 10 advanced Heron drones from Israel for USD 400
million, making Israel a weapons supplier competitor to the United States.

According to Mr Lall, use of the Sea Guardian drones by the Indian Navy will
also develop India's credible capabilities, which is significant for Indian
maritime security and naval power projection.

""Additionally, India faces a several complex security challenges in this
domain such as piracy, terrorism, environmental degradation and narcotics
trafficking. Maritime domain awareness would allow the Indian Navy an
advantage in patrolling the Indian Ocean, and in tackling its pressing
security challenges to achieve grander Indian strategic objectives,"" he said.

Responding to a question, Mr Lall said at least 2,000 jobs directly related to
the sale, and countless indirect jobs, will be created or saved in the US.

Mr Lall noted that this is the first major defence deal announced since the
designation of India as a major defence partner.

**A Bohra woman’s open letter to PM Modi on freedom from Female Genital Mutilation** 

 ______ 
People of the Bohra community at a prayer session (Express file Photo by Ganesh Shirsekar) People of the Bohra community at a prayer session (Express file Photo by Ganesh Shirsekar)

Dear Prime Minister Narendra Modi,

It was heartwarming to hear you specially refer to the plight of Muslim women who suffer from the practice of triple talaq, which is anti-women, on Independence day.

Our independence will always be incomplete if women are subjugated, raped, burnt and tortured in the name of custom, tradition and religion. Our constitution pledges to give us equality but in reality it is denied every time a girl foetus is killed, every time a bride is beaten up or tortured or even burnt in the name of dowry, every time a child is married off, every time a girl is molested, harassed and sexually assaulted.

Yes, unilateral triple talaq is unjust, but that is not the only issue which plagues the women of this country. I want to tell you about the practice of female genital mutilation which is performed on young minor girls who do not have the freedom to choose. Whose bodies are violated beyond repair despite there being a huge outcry against this practice across the world.

I take this opportunity to draw your attention to the horrific practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), also known as khatna or khafz, which is being perpetuated for centuries in our Bohra community. Bohras are a Shia Ismailia sect which are largely based out of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. There are approximately 2 million bohras.

Let me tell you what happens in my community even today. Whenever a girl child turns 7, she is taken by either her mother or grandmother to a local dai, or now a local doctor, surreptitiously without disclosing anything to the child and there the dai or midwife or the doctor cuts a part of her clitoris (specifically the clitoral hood). The resultant excruciating physical, sexual and emotional trauma of this act is life long.

There is one and only one reason this inhuman practice is performed: to tamper with the sexual desires of the girl/woman.

According to WHO, “FGM is recognised internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person’s right to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.”

For hundreds of years, this practice is being continued under a shroud of secrecy and silence and no one outside of the Bohra community even knew of its existence. Since November 2015, we, a group of Bohra women came together under the banner of ‘WeSpeakOut On FGM’, to just voice our sorrows, pains and traumas to each other. We found immense strength and courage when we connected with each other and vowed to start a battle against the pernicious practice of FGM in the Bohra community.

The collective, ‘WeSpeakOut On FGM’ has unsuccessfully tried to reach out to our clergy His Holiness Syedna Muffadal and have through letters pleaded with him to hear our voices and our concerns and end this practice in the community. Sadly our voices fell on deaf ears and not only does the practice continue unabated, the Holiness has now even publicly announced through his religious sermons and a public press statement that the practice of FGM has to continue as it is a 1400-year-old practice which must be continued at any cost. Little concern has been shown for gross human and child rights violation and the physical, emotional and mental trauma that each and every Bohra girl and woman has to face and live with.

Let us look at the world outside. On December 18, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted by consensus a Resolution which reaffirms its call to ban FGM worldwide. Further ending FGM is a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the UN and India stands committed to it.

Honourable Prime Minister you have on an earlier occasion rightly said that the Muslim women also have to be protected and be given equal rights as per the Constitution of India. I felt much relief with your words then, that, “getting Muslim women their rights as per the Constitution is the responsibility of the government and the people of the country”.

You have also said, “In democracy, there should be discussion”. So, I urge and request you to allow me and my Bohra sisters who are in the forefront of this struggle and who have endured FGM to be given an audience with you to share first hand our plight and to tell you of our struggles.

In December 2015, ‘WeSpeakOut On FGM’ had started a signature campaign on Change.org in India to mobilise public opinion on the subject of FGM and to appeal to the government to have a dialogue with us on banning this practice. We have garnered 90,000+ signatures supporting us, but unfortunately we have not received any response from the government.

Honourable PM, we the Bohra women are waging a battle for equal rights and a gender-just system, it has got nothing to do with religion. The Koran has not prescribed FGM and in India the majority of Muslims do not practice FGM except for the Bohras and some communities in Kerala. This is a cultural tradition which has been perpetuated for centuries. We are now in the 21st century and the world is a changed place. Women are no longer chattels who can be taken and any part of their body be cut to curb their sexuality. We humbly request the Government to take note of this and act now on ending FGM in India.

More than 23 countries in the world have banned FGM and made it a punishable offence. Countries like the United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Australia and other European countries have been extremely pro-active in punishing the perpetrators of this practice and do much to spread awareness in communities about the harmful effects of FGM on the girl child. As of 2013, according to a UNICEF report, 24 African countries have legislations or decrees against FGM/C practice; these countries are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria (since 2015), Senegal, Somalia, Sudan (some states), Tanzania, Togo and Uganda Zambia and South Africa. In 2015, Gambia has also banned FGM. India needs to do the same.

The national and international media have given enough coverage to this practice but what we now need is an active intervention from the state.

One last point that I want to bring to your notice is that what we are asking for is really doable without in any way affecting our religious tenets, rights , practice and traditions. There are several countries in the world like USA, UK, France, Australia etc., where already the Bohras are banned from performing FGM and are being prosecuted if and when they violate the laws in their countries which ban FGM. The same can be very well done in India and a pernicious centuries old practice can be ended under your stalwartship.

Please ban FGM/Khafz in India and through it Bohra Beti Bachao.

Yours truly,

Masooma Ranalvi

**Nitish Kumar's Party To Join NDA, Likely To Get Berths In Modi Cabinet** 

 ______ 
Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United passes resolution to join BJP-led NDA (file
photo)

**Patna: **

Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United formally decided to head back to

the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance or NDA on Saturday

that it had exited abruptly in 2013 ending a partnership that had lasted
nearly two decades. The homecoming for the JD (U) comes weeks after the Bihar
Chief Minister exited the grand alliance with the Congress and Lalu Yadav's
RJD, a rainbow coalition that the opposition believed was the template to
prevent the BJP's return in 2019.

Mr Kumar had picked up the invite to join the BJP's national coalition

during his Delhi visit last week and got a formal seal of approval from the
party's national executive meeting in Patna today. The JD (U) is also expected
to be offered about two ministerial berths in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
council of ministers to cement the ties.

A formal announcement is expected later in the day once the

meeting of the national executive

, the party's highest decision-making body ends. But it was on expected lines.

Just as it was a given that Sharad Yadav, who is estranged from Chief Minister
Nitish Kumar over his alliance with the BJP, will skip the meeting where he
had been invited to voice his views about the alliance.

Mr Yadav, instead, reached Patna

but chose to be at a meeting convened

by about two dozen JD (U) leaders who were suspended because they were seen
with him during his tour of three districts.

Sharad Yadav, who had co-founded the JD (U),

for speaking against the alliance with the BJP. But he hasn't been suspended
by Nitish Kumar's party so far. but JD (U) general secretary KC Tyagi served a
stern warning to his former mentor Sharad Yadav, 70.

""Sharad Yadav is invited for the JD (U) national executive meet and he can

**Rs 1000-crore Srijan scam rocks Bihar: Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi under fire; all you need to know about the case** 

 ______ 
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi have been accused by Lalu Yadav of being involved in Rs 1000-crore Srijan Scam. (PTI Photo)

Srijan Scam has embarrassed Nitish Kumar government of Bihar, with the opposition alleging direct involvement of the CM and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi. The scam is about alleged transfer of government funds to an NGO Srijan Mahila Sahyog Samiti in Bihar’s district Bhagalpur. The NGO used to earn a high rate of interest on the government funds while keeping the principal amount intact. It is believed the ambit of the case may go beyond Bhagalpur to other districts of the state.

The NGO carried out this fraud for a period of 7 years between 2007 and 2014. Its operations were hit last year after the death of its founder Manorama Devi in February. Her son Amit Kumar and daughter-in-law Priya Kumar have been arrested.

What is the total worth of the scam?

Several reports peg the total worth of the scam to be over Rs 500-crore. According to IANS, the scam could be worth over Rs 1000-crore, while The Indian Express reported on August 15 that the scam is suspected to be worth over Rs 700 crore.

Modus Operandi

On August 14, Hindustan Times published the modus operandi of the scamsters unraveled by investigators probing into the case. According to the report, the NGO was working in cahoots with bankers and treasury officials to secretly divert government funds into its account and earn interest on the principal amount, while leaving it as it is. For this, the NGO used to write its account number on the reverse side of cheques issued by district treasuries to several government departments. The scamsters had also developed a system to generate fake e-statement of the bank to avoid getting caught. These fake statements were regularly sent to government offices for record keeping.

Moreover, the NGO also used to allegedly offer loans to people at very high rates of interest.

The NGO also prepared fake passbooks and escaped government audit between 2007-14, according to HT. The investigators have seized the laptop, which was used for running the fake banking software, printer, pen drives and alleged copies of bank e-statements. Nine people have also been arrested in connection with the case.

The details of the scam were exposed after officials seized the laptop from the possession of one of the accused.

The investigators are surprised as to how the NGO managed to carryout the fraud without getting noticed. Even the government departments failed to notice when fake e-statements continued to arrive despite no one asking for it. Bihar chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh told HT that the fake e-statements didn’t even bear the signature of bank officials.

The investigators suspect the involvement of some government officials as well.

According to IE, the government funds were apparently transferred to Srijan’s accounts in Bhagalpur branch of Indian Bank and branches of Bank of Baroda.

A senior police officer explained the Modus Operandi to The Telegraph like this: When the district magistrate used to issue cheque to the bank concerned to transfer funds from the treasury, staff member in his office used to stamp a fake signature at the back of the cheque with instruction to deposit the money in the NGO’s account. The officer told the daily that when the DM issued a new cheque for government expenses, the money was sent back to the account of the district administration from Srijan’s account. This is how the DM’s cheque never bounced and no body noticed the fraud. Further, the NGO also used to print fake e-statements at its office and provide to the DM’s office when required.

Why Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi are under fire from the opposition

Nitish Kumar has ruled the state since 2005, while Modi was the state finance minister for most of the time when the alleged fraud took place. RJD chief Lalu Prasad has demanded a CBI probe into the matter and demanded the resignation of Modi. A PIL demanding CBI probe into the case has also been filed in the Patna High Court by advocate Manibhushan Pratap Sengar.

Sengar has alleged that this is a scam worth over Rs 1000 crore and top politicians and officials may be involved in the scam.

On Thursday, Lalu leveled allegations against Kumar, BJP leaders Sushil Modi, Shahnawaz Hussain, Giriraj Kishore, Nishikant Dubey and Vipin Bihari. Lalu alleged that Nitish has joined hands with BJP to save himself from the probe into the scam.

I agree 1000%
Now I am not against the BJPor in favor or against any political party. I thought Vajpayee was a good PM. But BJP has ramped up anti-intellectualism and communal violence up to crazy. I am not saying Hindu extremists are the only ones at fault, Muslim factions are no less in creating communal terror nor are communist parties far behind. However, none of that absolves BJP of its own sins.

I agree.

Hmm....How about assaulting anyone for eating beef?  I mean, cow is sacred to the Hindus and we don't eat beef or even non-veg. However, my belief is that we can't stop everyone else from doing so. What if Muslims assaulted Hindus for not keeping fast during Ramadan? I am not saying Muslims are innocent, however, the Government is not far behind. I am all for banning Illegal butcheries of any kind, I am all for canceling butcheries that cannot maintain hygiene orproper waste disposal, I am also in complete favor of banning cow slaughter in Ayodhya and a couple of other pilgrimage sites of Hindus but a state wide beef ban is not sane.

Modi completely ignored the advice from many economists regarding DeMo but listened to the quacks from Artha - Kranti. He has constantly bashed the intellectual class. He tries to stifle any critical thought and any healthy criticism. I am not saying that there are not a few things on which I agree with him but he has shown himself to be an anti-intellectual and a propagandist on many occasions.",2017-08-19 17:56:29

Add along that you still have people that feel fear from politics that goes against their beliefs (religion). Then there is connecting with people, showing off that you were and are one of them, see Kejriwal and Modi doing it nearly all the time, Lalu and Nitish in Bihar. A lot of the people don't feel someone who was born in better conditions have a real understanding of their problems, hence they are not very popular, (see that someone like Manmohan Singh was never a member of Lok Sabha).

358,"&gt;why should they support UCC ? Read up mate, there is NO Sharia law in India.

&gt;UCC may sound like an 'Ideal utopian' chutiyapa that Modi has been promising for 3 years. One nation, One law, One tax. India is dozen nations within itself that can merrily coexist. No need to mess with it. If only Indian institutions were strong and independent, probably UCC might have been success. This will just be a tool for majority assertion on minority. Christians are any ways being targeted increasingly all over. It's just they are too small in number so it rarely makes to news.

&gt;UCC may rile muslims, sikhs and other minorities. In an age where India should focus on labour reforms, job creation, making Indian youngsters skilled to take work - UCC is a tool from govt to escape from it's apparent failures. You would not want internal disturbances and business turning away from India at the cost of UCC.

&gt;Bear in mind overwhelming muslims fall in same income bracket, prosperity zone as SC's or Dalits. Not all can afford court fees, and Indian courts are already overburdened with peding 2.7 crore cases (http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waiting-for-justice-27-million-cases-pending-in-courts-4500-benches-empty/story-H0EsAx4gW2EHPRtl1ddzIN.html)

&gt;However, there are unrecognised institutions which preside over muslim policy matters as division of property, marriage etc - they run dispute resolution 'courts' where in disputes arising out of marriage (muslims call it nikah), property division or any trivial matter is resolved - quickly and at nominal costs (50,100 Rupees)

&gt;Just because an institution's name starts with 'Jamiat -e-something' or 'Darul-e-something' doesn't mean it is working for ISI.

&gt;I grew up among Muslim neighbours and have seen their attitude, thought process from close quarters. They are just another working class dudes

359,"Actually, let me be clear. What I meant was, Liberalism is far left of conservatism and not objectively speaking as on a political compass. I said that because conservatism is something that better describes the right wing ideology that India displays currently and that even Indian left falls to the right of the policy of liberalism. So when I said that Liberalism was far left, I meant in the context of Indian politics. My mistake for not specifying that.

Liberalism is still defines as a left wing policy of you look at the traditional political spectrum where it is defined as left of center and moderates are defined as the centre. However, when you look at the four-point mapping of the political ideologies, you are correct in saying that liberalism is in the center and has a component of everything left, right, up and down, so yes, it is centrist, objectively speaking. But again, as I said, I am at fault for not mentioning the context. 

Liberalism is not libertarian, private property, individual autonomy. No, absolutely not. Liberalism is a balance between dictatorship and the power of individuals, a balance between capitalism and socialism, a balance between everything for the rich and robin hood, between religion, tradition, atheism &amp; intellectualism. It is, as you said in the center and is the perfect environment for the democracy to survive.

The thing is, like many scholars of today, I believe that when one tries to confine oneself to just left or right, much of this description kind of falls short because currently, people take the 2 axis interpretation of political ideologies where policies are authoritarian/libertarian and left/right and even that is considered insufficient since it is massively influenced by the internal politics of the country eg. Setting the minimum wage to $ 10 would be a left leaning move for a country where minimum wage is $7 but a right leaning move where the wage is $15 or increasing the wage from $0.87  to 12$ may qualify as a far left idea but from $10 to $12 may not be so when I refer to merely right or left, I am not referring to the political compass, I am talking in terms of the internal politics of the country. Obviously, you didn't know that which is why I should have specified.

Libertarian has both left and right forms in the two axis sytem. So, libertarianism does not actually make a policy left or right, however, it does have an effect on the progressiveness of the policy which increases as we move lower on the y- axis, so it is kind of faulty to include libertarianism in a discussion of left and right. Gandhi was a left libertarian or a libertarian democrat-socialist to be exact, so India is actually founded by a left libertarian, went on to the upper left during Indira who almost turned communist and then jumped to the upper right with identity politics. Indians firmly believe in socialism which is only a small part of communism but not synonymous to it. SO when you say 

&gt; a normal Indian is very much likely to accept commie beliefs(not the state owning your property part) if you don't tell them that those are commie beliefs 

that is what you are referring to. Plus Indians do not even believe in the communist version of socialism but democratic socialism.

Scrapping reservation would actually be a left policy for India where governments are over sympathetic enough to provide 70-80% reservation in some states. That is not even close to the center and makes the upper right. However, it would still be something a communist would do which is upper-left on the spectrum. However, if it were done by a referendum, it would become a lower left policy. Depends on how you do it just as much as what you do. 

This is why I believe we can't just talk of a policy in terms of left and right, we have to include authority in the discussion as well. However, either way, it would be a left move, progressivism is a whole another axis. 

&gt;Neolibralism is left but it isn't as progressive to be called far left. 

Like I said, progressivism is another axis from left and right.

&gt;right wing economic policies may be a bit anti poor but they don't print intellectualism as immoral.

Incorrect, when a person takes recommendations of ArthaKranti over economists, says that Heinsburg read Vedas to discover the uncertainty principle and appoints, promotes digital India and cashless economy when hundreds of villages don't even have light or banks. These are perfect signs of an anti-intellectual.

Which is what I don't understand.

I never said that they didn't. If they are interested in politics they would. But people who don't know the larger ideologies and are not interested in politics adhere to something, even a single thing they identify with - like religion irrespective of which side it comes from. The problem is they would vote on just that even of the policies of the person are completely contrary to what these people want.

Also, connecting with people can be done every which way. Modi, instead of promoting Hindutva could have just as easily made people King worship him by saying I was a tea seller and became a PM because of education and could have promoted education. However, that involves spending money on education. However, he does not have to spend money when rallying people around religion. 

Plus when people become aware, they would criticise him for stuff he does wrong even if they were still religious and he would lose traction. But people never lose traction with religion, so he can keep rallying them forever.

Please explain to me how a sane person would do any of that. Just because people repeat them too often does not make them a non-argument. They still remain anti-intellectual.

Yes, and they were. Grabbing everyone for male sterilisation irrespective of whether they are 8 or 80 is anti-intellectual. And beef ban is anti- intellectual whether it comes from BJP, Congress or CPI. That is the whole point of intellectualism - a bad thing is bad whether it happens with the other guy or by you.

&gt;anyone who brings in beef ban and demo and tries to close the argument using only these two is closed minded.

I could provide more examples. Just tell me the topic you want to discuss. I am not closing the argument, you are. How are you an intellectual for not providing any fact based argument but replying to my carefully weighted alternatives by bashing COngress? That doesn't make you intellectual that makes you an anti-intellectual BJP shill. See, here religion played no part, but politics did.

If a communist says 'marx started it' it doesn't absolve them of what they do. perpetrating a bad thing is bad whether you started it or not. you had the opportunity to make 1001 decisions, whichever you chose is on you and makes you just as irrational as the person who started it - in fact more irrational since you would have the case study of the past to know how it played out then.",2017-08-19 21:36:30

**At Least 23 Killed, 400 Injured As Utkal Express Derails In UP's Muzaffarnagar**

The Puri-Haridwar-Kalinga Utkal Express derailed barely 100 km from Delhi

**New Delhi: **

At least 23 people have died and over 40 injured after 14 coaches of the

Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express

derailed in Uttar Pradesh this evening.

The

accident

took place around 5.46 p.m in Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, barely 100 kilometres
from the national capital, New Delhi. The train was headed from Puri in Odisha
to Haridwar in Uttarakhand. One coach rammed into a house on the sides of the
tracks and two coaches climbed one over the other.

Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has ordered an inquiry into the train
derailment to ascertain its cause. ""Strict action will be taken against any
lapse,"" the minister tweeted.

Kumar and the Muzaffarnagar district magistrate (DM) and directed them to
ensure prompt rescue and relief operations at Khatauli.

Two dozen people, many women and children have been admitted to nearby medical
facilities for treatment. The train had left Puri at 9 p.m. on Friday night
and was to terminate at Haridwar at 9 p.m. Saturday night. Railway officials
said a medical train was on way and that trains on the route have been
diverted through Shamli. Cutters and cranes have been requisitioned to cut the
mangled remains of the coaches and rescue people from inside.

Local residents of Khatauli town were the first ones to reach the passengers
and pulled out the ones they could. A 40-year-old woman, one of the many
rescued by residents, said she had occupied an upper berth. ""There was a loud
noise,"" she said. The screams and cries for help followed. ""I still can't find
my aunt,"" the woman, in her late thirties said.

The incident took place in Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, barely 100 kilometres

**Israel says will never support Pakistan on Kashmir** 

 ______ 
JERUSALEM/RAMALLAH: Under no circumstances will Israel support Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, top Israeli authorities have said.This is significant given that the country has been relatively silent over Kashmir, which is described as the core issue between India and Pakistan, despite standing shoulder to shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism.For India, the main issue with Pakistan is cross-border terrorism which continues to fan unrest in Jammu and Kashmir.For a while, after India established full diplomatic relations with Israel in the early 90s, Israel had endorsed India's position that Kashmir was an integral part of the country.However, as India's West Asia expert Rajendra Abhyankar described it, a certain entente cordiale emerged between Israel and Pakistan after 2003 with Israel starting to look at Pakistan as an important country of the Muslim world.The Delhi Declaration issued after the visit to India by then PM Ariel Sharon in 2003, the first bilateral visit by the PM of either country, did not mention Israel's position on Kashmir. Similarly, the recent visit by PM Narendra Modi , first by an Indian PM to Israel, did not see any direct or even indirect reference to the issue in public despite the tumult prevailing in the state for which India blames Pakistan.According to Israeli officials though, there is no question of Israel in any way supporting Pakistan, whatever might be the situation in Kashmir. This was conveyed, in response to a TOI query, to a delegation of Indian journalists and politicians who were brought to Israel by the American Jewish Committee (AJC).The query also touched upon why, despite claiming to fully back India's stand on terrorism, the joint statement issued after Modi-Netanyahu meeting last month, neither made any specific mention of cross-border terrorism nor called upon Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice. In contrast, the Modi-Trump joint statement this year did not just name Pakistan, asking it to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of Mumbai and Pathankot attacks to justice, but also sought action against Pakistan based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.According to Israel though, the joint statement did not have to be exhaustive and that if something wasn't mentioned, it did not mean that it wasn't on the table. Israel also doesn't see the Kashmir issue as any form of religious conflict.It's perhaps a sign of the maturity of its relationship with India that Israel has the confidence to not pursue exclusive ties with New Delhi. As Israeli officials said, there was no reason for Israel to take a position on the Sino-Indian military standoff even though Israel was following the situation closely. Israel has great relations with China but, as an official put it, just as India's relations with Iran are not directed at Israel, Israel's relations with any country too were were not directed to India.However, while Israelis recalled Modi's visit as one of the most successful ever by a foreign leader, there was considerable disappointment at Ramallah, barely 10 miles north of Jerusalem, over Modi's decision to ignore Palestine during the visit. Unlike even his own foreign minister Sushma Swaraj, Modi chose not to visit Ramallah with his government looking to de-hyphenate ties with Israel and Palestine.""There's significant concern here that India is moving away from the policies it has followed since 1947,"" said Khalil Shikaki, the director of Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah.""The current PM (Modi) seems more interested in security and in relations with the West.

**India on way to become Vishwa Guru under Modi: Shah** 

 ______ 
Bhopal, Aug 19 (PTI) BJP president Amit Shah today said India was on the way to become ""Vishwa Guru"" (guide of world) under Prime Minister Narendra Modis leadership.

""Whenever the countrys history is written, the (history of) Modi period would be written in golden letters because of the steps taken by him for peoples welfare,"" he here.

Shah was speaking at a function to release Narendra se Narendra, a book written by BJP leader Kailash Narayan Sarang.

Swami Vivekanand, whose birth name was also Narendra, had predicted that India would become Vishwa Guru in the 21st century, and it is coming true under Narendra Modis leadership, he said.

""World over people started looking at India with respect (after Modi came to power) and that is not an honour for Modi or the BJP, but for 125 crore Indians,"" he said.

When Modi took over in 2014, there was an atmosphere of despair in the country and a policy paralysis because of the then prime minister ""who remained quiet"", the BJP national president said, adding that the situation has drastically changed.

""India is on the way to become Vishwa Guru now,"" he said.

""I met Modi (for the first time) in 1982. He is someone who always thinks of welfare of the country and its people,"" Shah said.

Earlier in the day, the saffron leader met some religious leaders, including Bhayyu Maharaj at the chief ministers residence here. He also held several meetings with BJP office-bearers. PTI MAS LAL KRK SRY

**Nitish joins NDA, Sharad calls it betrayal of voters** 

 ______ 
The Janata Dal (United) led by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar embraced the National Democratic Alliance at the Centre on Saturday, widening fissures within the party as leaders opposed to the tie-up called the move a betrayal of voters.

The formal decision paved the way for the party to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, four years after it walked out of the BJP-led NDA.

A resolution to rejoin the NDA was unanimously adopted at the party’s national executive meeting at Kumar’s home.

“The decision was taken following a request by BJP national president Amit Shah,” said JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi.

But several leaders, including former party president Sharad Yadav, are unhappy with Kumar’s “unilateral” decision to break off from the alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress to patch up with the BJP on July 26.

The Yadav faction held a parallel meeting named Jan Adalat at SK Memorial hall in the state capital.

The party’s founding member, who was removed as JD(U)’s Rajya Sabha leader, said the party was his and that the “grand alliance” with the RJD and Congress in Bihar is intact.

“We promised to continue this alliance for at least five years. The public gave us an opportunity … I am not happy with the alliance breaking,” he said.

His group is understood to have plans to approach the Election Commission to stake claim to the party’s “arrow” poll symbol.

“I formed the party and some people are telling me that this is not my home. People are raising questions over my intention. I wanted to attend JD(U)’s national executive but they didn’t allow me to participate and said that I don’t belong to their party,” he said.

Yadav’s remarks and action are seen as mutiny against Kumar’s leadership and he might be suspended from the party’s primary membership if he attends an RJD rally on August 27.

Tyagi said the party does not plan to take any action against Yadav, at least for now.

“But by deciding to attend the RJD rally, he will not only lose his stature and lifeline in the party but will also cross the Laxman rekha,” he warned.

Also, he reaffirmed that the party in united and alleged that rumours were being spread about fissures.

“Where is the split? Sixteen state presidents of the party attended the national executive meeting, despite the claim that the rival group had support in 14 out of 22 states where JD(U) has units. All 71 MLAs and 30 MLCs were there, so where is the split?” he asked.

The scenario outside the venue of the meeting in Patna belied his words as party workers loyal to Yadav clashed with supporters of Kumar.

Tyagi refused comments on the possibilities of JD(U) joining the Modi ministry.

“It is up to the Prime Minister and our president (Kumar) to take a decision on joining the Union cabinet,” he said, adding that no post has been offered to the JD(U).

The party is likely to get two berths in the Modi ministry despite having only two members in the Lok Sabha.

It has seven parliamentarians in the Rajya Sabha after two members – Yadav and Ali Anwar – distanced themselves from the party.

The JD(U) executive ratified Kumar’s decision to walk away from the three-party grand alliance over corruption charges in the Lalu Prasad-led RJD.

A day after tightly contested battle against Congress over one Rajya Sabha seat, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday said in the upcoming Gujarat Assembly elections the opposition party would be reduced to half of its current strength in the House. He said the Assembly elections would be fought on the issues of Narmada Yojna and welfare of the OBCs and the poor.

Shah made the remarks in the Assembly while taking part in a proposal to complete the Narmada Yojana at the earliest. He later resigned as Naranpura MLA, hours after being declared elected to the Rajya Sabha in the wee hours of Wednesday along with party colleague and Union minister Smriti Irani and Congress’s Ahmed Patel. On the final day of the two-day Monsoon Session of the Assembly, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani moved a congratulatory resolution over Shah’s election to the Upper House.

Before resigning as MLA, Shah addressed the House for more than one hour, during which he recollected his 20-years in the Assembly from 1997 to 2017. He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under whom he built his political career, for a range of initiatives taken by the latter first as chief minister of Gujarat and then as Prime Minister. “These elections (upcoming Assembly elections) are going to be fought on the issue of Narmada. It has to be fought on the issue of welfare of OBCs and the poor. When the elections will be held, I know what results will come. This number (of the opposition Congress) will be reduced to half,” said Shah, pointing at the vacant benches of the Opposition in the House. The Congress MLAs were evicted from the Assembly by Speaker Ramanlal Vora following their protest over the recent stone-pelting on Rahul Gandhi’s car in Banaskantha.

The BJP chief accused Congress of stalling the development of Narmada Yojana and of being hand-in-glove with alleged anti-Narmada groups like Narmada Bachao Andolan of Medha Patkar. “Whenever Congress party comes to power, Narmada Yojana gets stalled. Even today, Congress party’s stand has remained anti-Narmada,” Shah said. Speaking for the welfare of OBCs, Shah said, “From 1995 to 2017, the backward class people of the country have been demanding constitutional validity (for OBC commission). Narendrabhai introduced a law to give constitutional status to OBC commission, but Congress opposed it and brought it down in Rajya Sabha.” “But, their opposition is not going to work for long… By April, NDA will get majority in Rajya Sabha also,” he said.

Expressing confidence of BJP winning Gujarat Assembly elections due in December, Shah said that the party has not lost any election, Vidhan Sabha or Lok Sabha, in the state since 1990. Before this, CM Rupani, his deputy Nitin Patel and Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani also addressed the House to congratulate Shah. Rupani said, “This House has had many stars…And it will remember Amitbhai as a superstar.”

**This Republic Day, not one guest but 10 – Asean leaders** 

 ______ 
The unusual step is being taken to commemorate not only the 70th year of India’s independence, but also the 50th anniversary of the creation of ASEAN earlier this month. (Express File Photo by Tashi Tobgyal) The unusual step is being taken to commemorate not only the 70th year of India’s independence, but also the 50th anniversary of the creation of ASEAN earlier this month. (Express File Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)

India has collectively invited all leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the group of ten countries in that region, to be the chief guests at its 2018 Republic Day celebrations. All ten countries have, “in principle”, accepted they will send their heads of state or government to the event.

This is the first time that more than one head of state or government will be part of the Republic Day celebrations. In whatever manner protocol etiquette plays out, the fact that ten leaders from South-East Asia will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi behind a bullet-proof enclosure on January 26, is enough to make heads turn.

The unusual step is being taken to commemorate not only the 70th year of India’s independence, but also the 50th anniversary of the creation of ASEAN earlier this month. India and ASEAN will also celebrate 25 years of its partnership, when its Look East policy was launched by Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao in 1992. With so many anniversaries under its belt, images of the ASEAN Ten — Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines — taking the salute together on Republic Day will be enough to make this a significant moment in Delhi’s diplomatic calendar.

Meanwhile, Rao’s Look East policy has been transformed to the Prime Minister’s Act East policy. Prime Minister Modi is expected to participate in the India-ASEAN summit this November in Manila. The invitation to ASEAN is being done with one eye on China — it is also Beijing’s largest economic partner. At a time when Indian troops are eyeball-to-eyeball with Chinese troops in the Himalayas, the reaching out to ASEAN is also aimed at putting China on notice that two can play this game of expanding spheres of influence.

Government sources said this is “Delhi’s way of saying that China must also learn to come to terms with the other Asian power in the region, India.” ASEAN’s big economic success is a big draw for India. The grouping’s combined GDP has grown from $95 billion in 1970 to $2.5 trillion in 2014, not far behind China. And despite its financial diversity — Singapore tops with its per capita income of $52,960, which is 22 times that of Laos’ $2353 — and political differences, the grouping has held firm.

Some of the less pro-China nations in the region, like Singapore and Indonesia, are already saying that China cannot take them for granted. When Indonesia built an artificial island in the Natuna Sea and then claimed part of the adjacent South China Sea (which is fully claimed by China) as part of its exclusive economic zone, it was ready for and stared down the Chinese protest. Former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran recently recounted the furore in Singapore, in reaction to a public intellectual’s comments about the small country needing to come to terms with a rising China, pointing out that it “shouldn’t wear a sombrero when it doesn’t fit”. None other than the Singapore Foreign Ministry had to issue a statement to calm the people’s anger.

Loosely stated, Singapore and Indonesia, along with Vietnam and Thailand, are said to be less influenced by China, while much poorer Laos and Cambodia are believed to be much closer to Beijing. Singapore takes over the ASEAN chairmanship at the summit from Thailand in November, which means that its Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will be the first among equals when the Big Ten come to Delhi for the Republic Day in January.

Incidentally, Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi is moving towards a much more intimate relationship with Beijing, allowing it to build a port at Kyaukphu on the Arakan coast. Along with Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Gwadar in Pakistan, the Chinese seem to have wrapped up key locations for its One Belt One Road Initiative. Delhi is hoping its close friendships with Japan and Korea, along with key ASEAN nations who are in close proximity with China — like Vietnam, whose portion of the South China sea has also been gobbled up by the Chinese — will be enough to send a message to the Chinese that India won’t hesitate in expanding its reach.

On her part, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj is reiterating India’s civilizational role in the region, insisting that influence was won by the “three Cs, connectivity, commerce and culture,” — the building of temples in Cambodia, like Siem Reap, and in Indonesia like Borobodur — and never by “conquest or colonization”. The Prime Minister also hopes that India’s large market will be of interest to ASEAN. Just as Singapore is sometimes called India’s cleanest city (one-fifth of Singapore’s 5 million population is Indian expatriate), Modi hopes that India can also make good use of ASEAN’s service opportunities.

Together, India and ASEAN account for about 1.9 billion people (about 650 million in ASEAN) and a combined GDP of nearly $4 trillion. This is about $1 trillion more than China. Two-way trade is about $76 billion, on par with Delhi’s trade with Beijing.

**At Least 23 Killed, 72 Injured As Utkal Express Derails In UP's Muzaffarnagar** 

 ______ 
The Puri-Haridwar-Kalinga Utkal Express derailed barely 100 km from Delhi

**New Delhi: **

At least 23 people have died and over 72 injured after 14 coaches of the

Utkal Express

ran off the tracks in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday evening.

The

accident

took place around 5:46 pm in Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, about 100 kilometres
from New Delhi. The train was headed from Puri in Odisha to Haridwar in
Uttarakhand, a journey of about 36 hours. Television footage showed coaches
piled on top of others while

one carriage crashed into a house

on the side of the tracks.

Rescuers from the National Disaster Response Force or NDRF and various
divisions of the police worked for hours with gas cutters and cranes to find
survivors. A large number of local residents were also seen helping out in
rescue work. At around 11 pm, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted that the
rescue operations have been completed and all the injured have been shifted to
hospitals.

&gt; Rescue operations have been completed.All injured shifted to hospital.
Restoration work will start now.Still monitoring situation closely

&gt;

&gt; \- Suresh Prabhu (@sureshpprabhu) August 19, 2017

The minister said he has ordered an inquiry into the accident. ""Strict action
will be taken against any lapse,"" the minister tweeted.

A team of the anti-terror squad or ATS of the police was sent to the accident
site to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Authorities, however, maintain there
has been nothing yet to suggest foul play in the accident.

Police, national and state rescue teams were rushed to the area.

UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath spoke to principal secretary (Home) Arvind
Kumar and the Muzaffarnagar district magistrate and directed them to ensure
prompt rescue and relief operations at Khatauli.

Local residents of Khatauli town were the first ones to reach the passengers
and pulled out many survivors. A 40-year-old woman, one of the many rescued by
residents, said she was travelling in an upper berth. ""There was a loud
noise,"" she said. The screams and cries for help followed. ""I still can't find
my aunt,"" the woman, in her late thirties, said.

The incident took place in Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, around 100 km from New
Delhi.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted to express his condolences for the
families of those killed.

&gt; Railways Ministry &amp;amp; UP Government are doing everything possible &amp;amp;
providing all assistance required in the wake of the train derailment: PM

&gt;

&gt; \- PMO India (@PMOIndia) August 19, 2017

The accident hit train services on the busy Northern Railway route. The
Railways has announced a compensation of Rs. 3.5 lakh for the family of those
killed, Rs. 50,000 for those seriously injured and Rs. 25,000 for people with
minor injuries. The governments of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha also announced
compensation for the victims.

Railways has also released helpline numbers for updates on the accident.

**'Pahlaj Nihalani ducking summons was last straw'** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Former Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani 's decision to duck summons by the information and broadcasting ministry to discuss his functioning and insistence that Board officials are better equipped to deal with ""administrative issues"" proved to be the last straw for the government.Nihalani initially sought and received a deferment of the meeting but later avoided the interaction slated around the time the monsoon session of Parliament got under way on July 17, suggesting CEO Anurag Srivastava's presence, well placed sources said.The former Central Board of Film Certification chairperson was then informed of the government's decision to replace him. The view in government is that Nihalani's claim that he was sacked as he did not clear Indu Sarkar, a film based on the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi without cuts, is an after thought. He had been served ample cautions by successive information and broadcasting ministers but chose to ignore the warnings. His decision to skip the meeting at the I&amp;B ministry saw the matter being brought to the notice of PM Narendra Modi . A little later it was decided that Nihalani's tenure will be cut short and the decision was implemented after the monsoon session ended.Though Smriti Irani had taken charge of the ministry by then, the decision regarding Nihalani had already been taken, said sources. The government was embarrassed by criticism that Nihalani was imposing cuts in furtherance of a conservative ""sanskari"" agenda at the instance of the political leadership and his abrasive style made him a PR disaster. Inquiries about the insertion of a promotion of Swacch Bharat in Bajrangi Bhaijaan revealed that the filmmakers had been given to understand that this was on the prompt of the government. The producers were then asked to remove the promotion.The government hopes that Prasoon Joshi 's appointment as chief of CBFC will lead to the board functioning smoothly after Nihalani's rocky tenure. It is felt that subjectivity in censor decisions is inevitable but the Board will do a much better job of explaining its arguments.In interviews to the media, Nihalani has denied allegations that he was high handed in running the Board. He said he was not power hungry and denied insulting filmmakers. He said being called a ""sanskari"" censor chief was unfair and instead claimed that certain members of the CBFC had gunned for him relentlessly.However, the view in government is that Nihalani had been cautioned early on in his stint but did not alter his ways. His manner of explaining a decision seemed to raise hackles rather than putting across a cogent view and was cautioned by at least two senior ministers and the matter finally reached the PMO.

**'Drone sale to India would cement bilateral ties with US'** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: The US decision to sell 22 Sea Guardian drones to India at an estimated cost of USD 2 billion will create around 2,000 jobs in the US and ""cement"" bilateral ties , an American executive involved in the deal has said.""This should be viewed as a significant step in cementing the US-India bilateral defence relationship,"" Vivek Lall, chief executive US and international strategic development, General Atomics, told the Atlantic Council yesterday.Lall echoed Senator John Cornyn, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, who tweeted, ""Drone Sale Would Cement US-India Ties.""The announcement in this regard was made by Trump in June when he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.This prospective purchase of drones manufactured by General Atomics marks the first of its kind from the US by a country that is not a member of the NATO, Lall said.With China focused on South China Sea, Lall hopes that India has an opportunity to help create and lead a regional balance of power to protect its interests in the Indian Ocean region by building maritime engagements with regional and extra-regional partners.The Sea Guardian is a variant of the tested MQ-9 platform which allows for greater interoperability with the US and allied forces, in a way other platforms do not permit demonstrating the centrality of General Atomics' products to India's defence needs, he said.""This platform has 4 million hours in combat, will be able to certifiably fly in Indian civilian airspace and can remain airborne more than a record setting forty hours. Additionally, it has a 40,000-hour design life demonstrating its unique resilience. General Atomics maintains that this platform and its proven performance stands independently of and is unaffected by Israel's Heron sales to India,"" he said.This summer, India received 10 advanced Heron drones from Israel for USD 400 million, making Israel a weapons supplier competitor to the United States.According to Lall, use of the Sea Guardian drones by the Indian Navy will also develop India's credible capabilities, which is significant for Indian maritime security and naval power projection.""Additionally, India faces a several complex security challenges in this domain such as piracy, terrorism, environmental degradation and narcotics trafficking. Maritime domain awareness would allow the Indian Navy an advantage in patrolling the Indian Ocean, and in tackling its pressing security challenges to achieve grander Indian strategic objectives,"" he said.Responding to a question, Lall said at least 2,000 jobs directly related to the sale, and countless indirect jobs, will be created or saved in the US.Lall noted that this is the first major defence deal announced since the designation of India as a major defence partner.

IIT, IISc PhD Researchers To Get Rs 70,000 Monthly Central Fellowship

**Kolkata: **

The Union Government will now grant Rs 70,000 as monthly fellowship to 2,000
PhD scholars across IITs and IISc in the country. Union higher education
secretary Kewal Kumar Sharma has said this at the 67th Foundation Day function
of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur at its Kharagpur campus in
West Midnapore district yesterday. The fellowship will be given for five
years, reported Press Trust of India.

According to Mr Sharma, under the scheme, those graduating from IITs, NITs,
IIITs, if they do their Ph.Ds in IITs or IISc Bengaluru, they would be given a
very ""handsome fellowship"" of Rs 70,000 per month for five years.

Presently researcher-students get Rs 25,000 as monthly scholarship at IITs.

According to the list published by IIT Bombay in its official website, PhD
scholars are given scholarship of Rs. 25000 p.m. for first two years now and
after completion of two years of fellowship and on receipt of satisfactory
report on successful presentation of Progress Seminar, the fellowships are
enhanced to Rs. 28000 p.m. for remaining years (i.e. 3rd, 4th, &amp;amp; 5th
year).

There are 23 IITs in the country right now and an Indian Institute of Science,
which is based on Bengaluru.

In March this year, reports had emerged that, in order to further promote
higher education and retain talent in the country, the Human Resources
Development Ministry proposed a Rs 75,000 per month fellowship under the Prime
Minister's Research Fellowship Programme for selected PhD fellows at the IITs.

Before that,

in August last year

, an IIT official told PTI that, the central government was planning to grant
new scholarships worth Rs. 60,000 per month for five years to students of
Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) selected to promote innovation.

Premier IITs and IISc Bengaluru always get ranked among the best educational
institutes. In a ranking where universities from Singapore, China, South
Korea, Hong Kong and Japan topped, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay fared well recently in the Times
Higher Education's Asia University Rankings 2017. IISc Bangalore was ranked in
the 27th place while IIT Bombay secured 42nd rank.

IISc Bangalore was the only university from India found its place in

Times Higher Education's Best Small Universitie

s across the globe.

""As part of the research fellowship scheme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we
wish the meritorious students who are being forced to leave the country for
purely financial reasons stay within the country.

""We will provide 2,000 such monthly fellowships across the IIT system and IISc
Bengaluru,"" Mr Sharma said yesterday. ""Draft scheme is ready,"" he added.

Mr Sharma also said that the draft has gone past the Finance Ministry. ""The
Cabinet approval should come soon. We hope to make it possible in the next
couple of months, so it can be feasible to implement in the next session,"" he
said.

""We need to provide you attractive offers so you stay within the country,"" he
hoped.

**'Institutes of Eminence'**

The union government has also approved a scheme to enable select educational
institutions become 'Institutes of Eminence' to catapult them to the global
top 100 ranking slot, the official said on Friday.

""The government has approved a scheme where existing institutions will be
enabled to become institutes of eminence globally... 10 in private sector and
10 public sector,"" Mr Sharma said in the foundation day ceremony.

Under the 'Institute of Eminence' scheme, grants upto Rs 1,000 crore have been
approved over the next five years which will be given to the selected
institutions to attain rank of Institute of Eminence, reported IANS.

""Each institution will be called upon to submit a plan for next 10-15 years
which will be placed before a committee,"" he said.

**PM Narendra Modi warns ministers, tells them to not use perks of their office** 

 ______ 
The PM also expressed his dissatisfaction over ministers using vehicles owned by PSUs attached to their ministries. (PTI)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his displeasure over the misuse of official power by ministers. After a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday the Prime Minister cautioned ministers against staying in five-star hotels and has also told ministers to not avail any benefits from Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) attached to their ministries, this includes not using vehicles of the PSUs. The Prime Minister has said that he is unhappy that ministers tend to have a preference for staying in five-star hotels to staying in accommodations provided by the government. The Prime Minister has said that ministers should stay in accommodation provided by the government while on official visits and they should avoid the ‘temptation’ of five-star hotels, sources have told the Times of India.

The PM also expressed his dissatisfaction over ministers using vehicles owned by PSUs attached to their ministries. PM Modi has made it clear that he will not tolerate the usage of PSU vehicles by his ministers and members of their families. The PM is not happy with the fact that some ministers have begun to use the perks which come with their office. Ministers have also asked staff to ensure officials ‘perks’ are not used for personal use, as per the TOI report.

Many ministers have asked their staff to ensure that no vehicles from PSUs are used for personal use. The PM has made it amply clear that he will not compromise on his ‘zero tolerance for corruption’ stand. The Prime Minister wants to maintain the ‘scam free’ image of his government, as per the report.

**Why the Gorakhpur story is not about one night of horror** 

 ______ 
If I was the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh Rajiv Kumar, and if I was to hand over tomorrow to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath my inquiry report into the Gorakhpur children's deaths, the challenge before me would be: despite everything the public knows and much more that it doesn't, do I really know if those kids died due to a shortage of oxygen?I don't, because there are no bodies to examine medically. Long before one of India's biggest news stories this year escalated, hospital authorities had forced parents of dead children to go home to their rural hinterland in the dead of the night.As we speak, those 23 children lie buried a few feet below the ground in villages scattered from eastern Uttar Pradesh to Bihar, and possibly Nepal. All are buried because, apart from Islamic tradition, even Hindu infants are not cremated. So how can we tell if their lips, fingertips and toes were blue, among other signs? How do we know if the children choked to death as oxygen ran out?Depending on whether you like or hate Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath, you would have already reached your verdict on this heart-breaking question.But the answer is a little more complex than the ""yes"" or ""no"" you have arrived at.The story of the dead children of Gorakhpur is about poor governance over years, maybe decades — not just medical negligence. Just like the story of dozens of kids being sodomised and killed in Noida's Nithari was not just the story of a psychopath — but equally the story of poor governance — of a town where municipal cleaners did not clean a huge drain for ten years so the body parts could never be detected.The Gorakhpur region is one of the filthiest areas of Uttar Pradesh. Vast parts of the city don't even have an underground sewerage system, forcing people to use septic tanks or defecate in the open. The villages face the same sanitation issues that cities do but successive governments have just not bothered to build means to keep villages clean.Have you ever thought of a very basic question: you know where the city's waste goes, and how it's collected, but is waste collected in a village, and where does it go? Well, nowhere. A filth time bomb is ticking away in rural India because lifestyles are changing there and the same chips packets and water bottles and other urban non-biodegradable waste is choking the landscape. But governments seem to think that rural citizens in India still live the idyllic, simple lives they did decades ago.Add to this (and this is one of my favourite cribs), rural India has virtually zero monitoring of how government funds are spent - and the same people spending (district magistrates) are the same people monitoring.As we know very well over the five years at Gaon Connection, rural India is not the priority of mainstream media by a thousand miles. So Gorakhpur is what happens when governments don't have any way to monitor poor governance by local functionaries, and when the mainstream media rarely covers public health — except when 23 children suddenly die.And why this fake chest-beating over last week's deaths at the BRD Hospital when nearly 2,000 children die at the same hospital every year, and about 10,000 children have died at the same hospital over the past decade?Governments in India have largely abdicated their role in public health, taking it for granted that blood-sucking but better-run private facilities are doing the job anyway. When what remains is just not monitored, Gorakhpur happens.When encephalitis was killing thousands for years, why weren't villages cleaned up? Why weren't citizens told in innovative ways what was causing the disease wiping out their children? When other major hospitals in UP bought liquid oxygen directly from manufacturers like INOX or Lende Gas, why was an intermediary, Pushpa Sales, given the BRD contract for years? To siphon money because these two companies are known to not give kickbacks as a strict policy? How was the hospital principal Rajiv Mishra's wife even sitting on his chair? How was the celebrated Dr Kafeel running a private service and even advertising it on the walls of the government hospital? Why were warnings of oxygen shortage ignored? Why was money not disbursed to the oxygen vendor in a crisis though the principal had adequate money in his account?The more we scrape the dust off the story, the more rot we find.(Lucknow-based Misra is a radio storyteller and founder of Gaon Connection)

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday made an array of announcements to boost education the state. Chouhan announced 33 per cent reservation for women in all government departments excluding forests, ANI reported. “I announce 33% reservation for our daughters in all departments, except forest department,” Chouhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Citing high dropout rate after 12th standard, Chouhan announced that students who would score more than 75 per cent marks in the intermediate examination (class 12) will be provided free higher education from the state government. “Many students find higher education unaffordable and are often forced to drop out after Class XII,” Chouhan said. “Students who had scored 75% in 12th, will pay their fee,” CM Chouhan was quoted as saying by CMO Madhya Pradesh. Addressing a conference, Chouhan also cited some flagship programmes from Narendra Modi government.

“Make in India, Skill India, Digital India are flagship schemes of PM. Under his leadership we are working towards the creation of New India,” CM Chouhan said. The chief minister also mentioned his government’s efforts to better the education in the state. “When I became CM, 43 Lakh children were out of schools. We started ‘School Chale Hum’ campaign, wanted to send every child to school,” MP CM said.

ANI reports that the ‘School Chale Hum’ is a campaign aimed at enhancing enrolment in government schools in MP’s Raisen district. Earlier, Chouhan also praised PM Modi’s initiative to create new India and ‘Naya MP’ for the people, ANI reports. Chauhan, addressing a gathering at ‘ Yuva Samvad,’said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has administered a new India pledge. To create new India and also to create ‘Naya Madhya Pradesh’ this is very important for the people.”

Surjewala says that the railway safety still remains under the cloud of question mark with such accidents taking place at continuous basis. (Image: PTI)

The Congress Party on Saturday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the recent derailment of the Puri-Haridwar-Kalinga Utkal Express, near Khatauli railway station in Muzaffarnagar and accused the Centre of being careless regarding the safety of the passengers travelling with the Indian Railways which has claimed so many lives in past three years. “Since Modi Govt took over in May 2014, 259 passengers have lost their lives &amp; 899 injured in 27 train accidents. When will Govt wake up?,” Congress leader Randeep Surjewala told ANI. Surjewala further said that the railway safety still remains under the cloud of question mark with such accidents taking place at continuous basis. “If Prime Minister Modi can spend Rs 1 lakh crore on a bullet train, which he promised between Ahmadabad and Mumbai, why can’t he allocate 40 thousand crore for railway safety. We have seen platform tickets go up. We have seen, passengers fare go up, but railway safety remains under a serious cloud,” he told ANI.

Further stressing on the same, Surjewala requested the government to wake up from their sleep and take some action after taking lessons from this incident. “We sincerely hope and request the government to at least wake up from its slumber taking a lesson from this painful train accident in Muzaffarnagar and ensure that adequate time bound measures are taken for the railway safety,” he said. Surjewala said that no amount of compensation and money can bring back the lives of those who have died. “Important question is how they are going to prevent such incidents from happening in future. What steps have they taken and lesson learnt from such incident,” he added.

Here are the updates so far:

– Fourteen coaches of Puri-Haridwar-Kalinga Utkal Express derailed in Muzaffarnagar’s Khatauli area

**Defence firms eye billion-dollar chance for 'made in India'** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India has drawn up a shopping list for tens of billions of dollars of foreign fighter jets, armoured vehicles, submarines and helicopters but it will only sign the cheques if they are made in India.The world's largest defence importer has announced a new policy inviting foreign defence manufacturers to set up shop as minority partners in India. It initiated the bidding process for submarines in July.Such deals would boost job creation and bring key defence technologies into India.Foreign companies say the opportunity is too good to miss.Europe's Airbus Group, angling to sell its Panther helicopters, has said that if it wins a contract worth several billion dollars and expected to span at least a decade, it would make India its global hub for the multi-purpose choppers.The company currently builds them at Marignane in France. Lockheed Martin says if its F-16 fighter jets are selected -- it will likely compete with Saab for that order of close to $15 billion -- it will ""support the advancement of Indian manufacturing expertise.""Germany's ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and France's Naval Group are eager to compete for a contract of up to $10 billion to build submarines in the South Asian country.Luring foreign defence companies to build in India would be a major and much-needed boost to the economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi , with less than two years to national elections, is under intense pressure to create more jobs for the hundreds of thousands of people joining the workforce every month.Growth in the first three months of 2017 slowed to 6.1 per cent. Experts expect further disruption as businesses adjust to a new nationwide goods and services tax launched in July.India is seeking to follow other countries which created defence sectors by backing a few big players with long-term defence orders and allowing smaller businesses to develop around them.""Countries that have a robust defence industry have a few large companies that are supported by their government with large, long-term defence orders,"" Amber Dubey of the KPMG consultancy in India told AFP.""They in turn create an eco-system of large and small suppliers to stay competitive.""India currently imports at least 90 per cent of its defence equipment including parts for assembly. It is banking on foreign companies to bring in new technology.The lowest bid is one key selection criteria that worries some of the competitors.""We'd like to see the Indian government work with the US government to ensure that these acquisition policies don't disadvantage US companies just because we can't get the lowest price,"" Cara Abercrombie, former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for southeast Asia, told a recent panel in New York.Under the strategic partnership policy, India will line up domestic companies that foreign players have to choose from to set up local plants.For the Indian companies, which would hold the majority stake, it is a big win, says Dhiraj Mathur, an aerospace and defence specialist for the PwC consultancy.""You know nothing about defence manufacturing and you're going to partner with a global leader to make highly sophisticated equipment and the only reason they're talking to you is because the government has told them to,"" he said.The Indian government wants to bring the local companies up to global standards to compete for the next round of orders. China also built up local defence equipment manufacturing by forcing international firms to link up with Chinese companies and to hand over technology.In India's case, the foreign players are still pushing for ownership.""Let us take a lead, let us be the majority,"" said Ashish Saraf, vice president for industrial development at Airbus.""Or let the Indian guys assume full liability (as per the policy). Assuming liabilities on an aircraft is not easy.... If a product fails, we are talking about hundreds of millions.""His suggestion is a middle road where foreign companies can hold the majority stake, which can be pared back over time as the Indian partner gains in knowledge and experience.""It takes years to transfer (technology) and to get proven products. These are complex products that need to perform in battles,"" said Saraf.The other hurdle in the policy is that transferring defence technology requires government approval.In a strategy similar to one followed by the United States, India puts the onus on the foreign partners to get the green light from their respective governments, a challenging task for them.""But if you want indigenisation, this is the only way you'll get it,"" said PwC's Mathur.

**91 Lakhs? 56 Lakhs? 5.4 Lakhs? Fact-Checking Centre's 'Tax Surge' Claims** 

 ______ 
Narendra Modi said that 56 lakh people filed Personal Income Tax Returns after
demonetisation.

**New Delhi: **

To counter increasing evidence that demonetisation may have dented the Indian
economy, the government has put out a series of statistics to show that the
contentious move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes last November has
improved economic health, specifically by expanding India's tax base.

In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that 56 lakh
people filed Personal Income Tax Returns after demonetisation, an increase
over last year.

The latest Economic Survey says 5.4 lakh new taxpayers were added after the
notes ban, an increase of 45 per cent over last year.

In a press conference earlier this year on the successes of the government's
""clean money"" drive, Finance Minister Arun Jaitely earlier had said that 91
lakh new taxpayers were added. No time period was specified, leading some to
infer that those numbers were added after the notes ban.

To add to this, just two weeks ago the government issued a press release on
August 7, citing more data on increases in India's tax base as a result of
demonetisation.

The release mentioned, amongst other successes, a 41 per cent increase in
advance tax collections.

Faced with criticism that it was putting out conflicting, cherry-picked data,
the government issued a fresh press release on August 18, arguing that the
numbers were not contradictory, but culled from different time periods.

While it indeed does appear to be the case, an examination of each of those
claims doesn't address the wider questions over whether demonetisation, which
wiped out 86 per cent of currency in circulation, has indeed led to a tax
""surge"".

First, the claim mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech that the number of
returns filed by individuals is up 56 lakh from about 2.23 crore returns last
year, to 2.8 crore this year, a rise of 25 per cent. The period in question is
cited as April 1, 2017 to August 5, 2017.

However, looking at annual figures from previous years shows nothing unusual
about the 25 per cent increase.

In financial year (FY) 2015, the number of returns were up 15.3 per cent over
the previous year; in FY 2016, that rose to 4.1 crores, a 27 per cent jump.

The claim by the Economic Survey of 5.4 lakh additional taxpayers after
demonetisation - and increase of 45 per cent over the previous year - also
does not appear significant when seen in light of overall data.

According to the government, the figure is from the period 9th November 2016
to 31st March 2017.

The Survey itself accepts that this is 1 per cent of all new taxpayers

In 2014-15, 76 lakh new tax payers were added, Finance Ministry data shows.
That figure fell to 63.5 lakh the following year and in 2016-17, it climbed to
80.7 lakhs, according to the Economic Survey.

Where matters become confusing is over the Finance Minister's claim of 91 lakh
new taxpayers.

NDTV had reported earlier

that this figure was not for the period after demonetisation, but the entire
year.

The latest government release accepts this. However, the Economic Survey cites
a different number - 80.7 lakh new taxpayers - for the same period.

The release explains the contradiction by saying that the Survey is using a
different period and different type of taxpayers.

The Survey, however, clearly states that the number is of new individual
taxpayers for 2016-17.

**Post Notes Ban, Separatists, Maoists Feel 'Fund-Starved': Arun Jaitley** 

 ______ 
Arun Jaitley said notes ban reduced number of people taking part in stone-
throwing in Jammu and Kashmir.

**Mumbai: **

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said demonetisation left Maoists in
many parts of India and separatists in Jammu and Kashmir ""fund starved"".

He said it greatly reduced the number of protesters taking part in stone-
throwing in the state.

""Stone pelters used to gather in thousands on the streets of Kashmir before
demonetisation was announced, but now not even 25 come together for such
agitations,"" he said.

""After demonetisation, separatists in Jammu and Kashmir and also Maoists in
states like Chhattisgarh have become fund starved,"" the minister said.

Mr Jaitley was speaking at a function organised by Mumbai BJP president Ashish
Shelar. He spoke on the topic 'New India Pledge'.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was also present on the occasion.

Elaborating on benefits of the move to scrap high-value notes in November
2016, Mr Jaitley said money which was earlier getting circulated outside the
economy had come into the formal banking system.

On the BJP's vision of building a 'New India', he said, ""We want to spend
funds on defence, rural development and infrastructure.""

""We should have world-class public institutions so that shameful incidents
such as the Gorakhpur tragedy do not recur,""

The finance minister said the Modi government was not satisfied with a 7-7.5
per cent GDP growth rate.

To accelerate the growth rate, the government would continue to take tough
decisions in the interest of the nation as it had done since coming into power
in 2014, he said.

Mr Jaitley listed several achievements of the BJP-led government, which had
completed three years in power.

Among them, he spoke about the GST rollout, notes ban, the insolvency and
bankruptcy code, amendment to laws related to benami transactions, fair
allocation of spectrum and natural resources and double taxation avoidance
treaties signed with various countries.

**Amit Shah acknowledges Mamata Banerjee’s outreach to PM, thanks her for favouring Narendra Modi leadership**

Shah thanked Banerjee for her ‘praise’ for prime minister’s work.(PTI)

Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah on Saturday acknowledged West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s outreach to PM Narendra Modi. Shah thanked Banerjee for her ‘praise’ for prime minister’s work. Earlier, Mamata had told CNN News 18 that she favours Modi, but has differences with Shah. The BJP President’s comments came during the question answer session of a press conference in Madhya Pradesh’ Bhopal.

In his other important remarks, Amit Shah lauded Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and said that the latter transformed the state from a ‘BIMARU’ one to ‘most developed’ states category of the country. Shah added that Chouhan government’s hard work for the implementation of schemes launched by Modi government is evident. Shah also said that Narendra Modi government is working aggressively to eradicate corruption at the centre. He added that Opposition has not been able to put a single corruption charge on Modi government even after three years of rule.

Speaking on BJP-JDU alliance in Bihar, Shah said that all parties in National Democratic Alliance become a part of Cabinet at Centre, hinting at a possible addition of ministers from Nitish Kumar’s party. On Friday, Shah said that his party has not come to power in the state for a mere 5 or 10 years, but at least 50 years. “Today, we have a majority government at the Centre with 330 MPs, and also have 1,387 MLAs in different states. The party appears to be at its peak, but dedicated workers feel we have a long way ahead,” a BJP’s press release had quoted Shah as saying.

“We have not come to power for 5-10 years, but at least 50 years. We should move forward with a conviction that in 40-50 years we have to bring major changes in the country through the medium of power,” Shah had said.

**Mood of the Nation poll: Full marks for Indian Railways under Modi government** 

 ______ 
The Mood of the Nation (MOTN) has given high marks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Between 40 to 50 per cent of respondents feel he is doing a good job on social issues and healthcare. This has translated into his dizzying personal popularity-nearly 33 per cent of respondents rate Prime Minister Modi the best Indian chief executive ever and one reason why the survey shows the NDA is projected to win a comfortable majority, 349 seats, if elections were held today.

But where his government seems to have hit the ball out of the park is in the railways. Fifty eight per cent of 12,178 MOTN respondents surveyed across the country feel the railways have significantly improved in the last three years.

Seen in perspective, a 58 per satisfaction level is higher than almost every other achievement of the Modi government even in its successes in the power sector, road infrastructure and social sector issues like drinking water, quality of schools, colleges and hospitals. Fifty six per cent said that the power situation had improved, 50 per cent of respondents said that the quality of schools and colleges had improved, 52 said the quality of hospitals had improved, 51 per cent noted an improvement in road quality.

Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu figures in the top 5 achievers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet with a 10 per cent rating. The list is topped by Finance and defence minister Arun Jaitley who has a rating of 28 per cent.

Railway officials say the quantum leap in rail sector infrastructure over the past three years have been greater than in the past thirty years-16,700 km of rail track were electrified as opposed to 19,000 km in the last thirty; 12,690 km of rail track have been sanctioned for doubling in the last three years. Only 7,192 km of track were doubled in the last 30 years. The 4 lakh crore spent on rail infrastructure in the last three years is 20 per cent of the cumulative amount (Rs 4.9 lakh crore) spent on railway infrastructure since independence. Not to mention that 32,000 bio-toilets have been fitted in trains to eliminate waste, over the past year. Only 10,000 such toilets were fitted over the last decade. There are mammoth infrastructure projects like the Dedicated Freight Corridor- over 3,300 km of rail track between Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata-which have been speeded up. But while these will take a few more years to complete and for their effect to be felt, what explains the dizzying satisfaction spike in railway services?

One factor could be the focus on improving the passenger experience. The railways have worked hard to upgrading the quality of food, bedding and cleanliness of coaches used by an estimated 22 million railway passengers each day.

Another factor could be the bolstering of complaint redressals through social media. A social media monitoring team functions out of Rail Bhavan in Delhi 24x7. All General Managers and Divisional Railway Managers have been on Twitter over the past two years. The social media cell receives over 1,000 actionable tweets and over 200 complaints on Facebook each day.Also Read

I grow tired of hearing this same lies about the Gandhi's being corrupt. There was a BJP government in the past under Vajpayee and yet they didn't even file a single FIR against them, even though their party claimed that the Gandhi's were corrupt.

**27 major mishaps in 3 years, Prabhu should own up: Congress**

“The Railway Minister must own responsibility. Forget bullet trains, 27 train accidents have taken place since the Modi government took office,” the Congress said. “The Railway Minister must own responsibility. Forget bullet trains, 27 train accidents have taken place since the Modi government took office,” the Congress said.

A DAY after 14 coaches of the Kalinga Utkal Express derailed in Muzaffarnagar, the Congress hit out at the government and asked Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu to take responsibility for the accident. It said 27 major railway accidents have taken place in the past three years, reflecting the “dismal safety record” of the government.

The NDA government has increased railway fares by 70 per cent since it assumed office, but no concrete blueprint had been laid down to secure lives of passengers, said Congress communication department head Randeep Surjewala. Claiming that safety protocols had been compromised with, he said “criminal negligence” on the part of Railways is responsible for the derailment.

The main opposition party asked why no “caution call” was made to the driver of Utkal Express if signaling work was underway on the tracks. “Will the Prime Minister and the Railway Minister, who regularly boast about laying new tracks, tell us why just 200 m of track in this area couldn’t be repaired for the past many months,” he said.

“An utterly dismal picture of accident preparedness is revealed by the fact that 65 private ambulances and local citizens with gas cutters rushed to the accident site, while Railway authorities and local administration reached much later.” “The Railway Minister, who continuously unveils grand schemes of privatisation and spends majority of the time on Twitter, has utterly failed to perform his primary duty to secure passengers. People demand basic facilities and a safe rail network. It is time the BJP government stops painting, polishing and garnishing the most important public transportation system which needs urgent tangible reforms that secure the commuters.”

The Congress claimed 27 major railway accidents have happened since May 2014, resulting in the death of 259 passengers. “The Railway Minister must own responsibility. Forget bullet trains, 27 train accidents have taken place since the Modi government took office.” “Every time there is an accident, the Railway authorities invent a fresh conspiracy to wash their hands of culpability, but facts speak otherwise,” he added.

**Rebooting the idea of the farm economy** 

 ______ 
Between 2001-02 and 2016-17, horticulture production doubled from 146 million tonnes to 295mt, while foodgrain rose from 213mt to 273mt. Photo: Mint

Addressing the annual general meeting (AGM) of ITC Ltd last month, chairman Y.C. Deveshwar signalled to shareholders of the company that future fortunes lay in exploiting the opportunities that would be thrown up by the impending fundamental transformation of Indian agriculture.

In an insightful speech titled “Adding value to agriculture”, Deveshwar made an observation: In future, he said, the farmer instead of selling what they produce would grow what the consumer needs.

Indeed, he is flagging an important shift. It will, for one, begin reversing the burden of risk, which at the moment is overwhelmingly weighed against the farmer. Effectively, this is like hitting the reset button on the idea of the Indian farm economy: instead of being supply-side driven, it will be led by demand.

Needless to say, this will radically rework existing relationships within the farm sector and of it with the rest of the economy too. In short, the ecosystem around Indian agriculture is poised for a fundamental makeover—with the market replacing the government as the dominant agent of change. Only logical that this raining of change will leave the associated politics untouched.

Implicitly, Deveshwar is arguing that the Indian farmer is ready to undertake this transition. The reality on the ground is that this is already happening.

The best example to highlight this transition is the remarkable story of Indian horticulture. It has over the last decade and more, rapidly taken root and has in fact displaced foodgrains in the agrarian economic framework in terms of output. Between 2001-02 and 2016-17, horticulture production doubled from 146 million tonnes (mt) to 295mt, while foodgrain rose from 213mt to 273mt.

This structural change has been in response to the policy incentives as well as shifting consumption patterns as India traded up—data from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) reveals that as incomes have grown, the share of cereals in consumption has decreased, while that of fruits and vegetables has grown. Census 2011 revealed how India is materially much better off than before—something also captured in the steep fall in poverty levels from nearly 40% at the turn of the millennium to about 22% as per the latest estimates.

But what is overlooked is that the farmer has been ahead of the curve and that the required ecosystem to support a market economy in farming has been slower to emerge. Consequently, the risk-reward ratio continues to be skewed against the farmer.

A study by the Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET) reveals how on an average a 10th of the horticulture produce is wasted. In the case of guava, wastage is estimated at nearly 16% of the total produce in 2015. Clearly, this is not sustainable.

A policy response has already emerged: liberalizing investment norms, including allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in food processing industries. The onus is now on the private sector, as Deveshwar rightly points out, to make the best of the opportunity.

But this addresses only part of the risk being borne by the farmer. There is at the moment almost no cover for the price risk. Not only do none of the horticulture crops get covered by the minimum support price (the insurance floor price the government promises) price hedges like commodity options are yet to be made available to the farmer.

This serious shortcoming in addressing price risks has to be addressed at the earliest. In fact, it is one of the key factors contributing to the ongoing rural distress—the downside price risks in times of production exceeding demand is falling entirely on the farmer.

The good news is that after a long time, the farm sector has come to occupy centre stage in national politics. The bad news is that this is largely because of the persistence of rural distress. The consequent binary discourse is focusing the debate on the crisis instead of seeking solutions to address the root of the problem.

The onus is on Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to explore out-of-the-box solutions; the experience with demonetization suggests an appetite. Will they then employ their newly earned social capital (by expanding their national electoral footprint to an agrarian state like Bihar) in pushing politically risky but economically expedient move of hitting the reset button on Indian farming?

**India, Russia talk Doklam before Brics** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is in touch with Russia over the Sino-Indian military standoff at Doklam ahead of the upcoming Brics summit in China, official sources said. This is significant as India, hampered by an increasingly disoriented Trump administration, has looked at Moscow in the past 6 months to convince Beijing to shed its antagonistic approach towards India.This was obvious also in the way India reached out earlier this year to Russia to convince China to drop its opposition to India's bid for membership of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). ""Russia is an important strategic partner and it's natural to discuss issues concerning security with a friendly country,"" said an official requesting anonymity.In recent Brics preparatory meetings, Indian officials discussed with their Russian counterparts the situation at Doklam in Bhutan, reiterating India's position that by constructing a road China was unilaterally changing the status quo and that this had serious security implications for India.While India has not yet officially announced the participation of PM Narendra Modi in the Brics summit, which will be held September 3-5 in Xiamen in China, Russia is confident that the event will turn out to be successful despite the tension prevailing at Doklam.In that context, it may be significant to mention here that China has continued to stall the meeting of Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral foreign ministers' meeting which was scheduled earlier this year in April. Even though Beijing denied it, the decision to pull out of the meeting in April was widely seen as China's way of getting back at India for hosting Dalai Lama in Arunachal Pradesh.Despite Russia having worked actively to keep the RIC mechanism alive, the annual meeting couldn't take place this year because of ""differences over dates"". While India doesn't expect Moscow to come out in open with support for its position on Doklam, it won't mind the Russians working through diplomatic channels to convince Beijing to stop constructing road on disputed territory.It also won't be enough for Modi to just show up at Brics without keeping the outcome document in mind. New Delhi is looking for support from Russia to ensure that Indian interests, especially on the issue of terrorism, are not diluted.India will remember the Goa Declaration issued after the 2016 Brics summit which failed to address India's core concerns related to state-sponsored or cross-border terrorism. It is believed that China blocked the use of that term used by India to highlight Islamabad's support to India-specific terror groups. It also blocked India from name-checking Pakistan based terror groups like Lashkar and Jaish even as it let Russia mention Jabhat al-Nusra, a terror group in Syria.The fact that the Brics summit took place last year not long after the Uri attack, which saw 19 Indian soldiers killed in a cross-border terror strike, only added insult to injury. It is unlikely, officials said, that India will agree to such a formulation of the outcome document this year.As strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney had put it, China had then managed to successfully defend Pakistan terrorism at a multilateral event on Indian soil. As Indian officials admitted then, there was no consensus on naming Pakistan based groups as other Brics nations were not hurt by their actions.

**9 cities to get extra 313km of Metro lines** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Nine cities including Delhi, Noida, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Nagpur, Kochi, Bengaluru and Chennai are set to get additional 313 km on Metro Rail connectivity by March 2019. Till now the mass transit system is operational only on 370 kms in eight cities since the first Metro service began in Kolkata in 1984.While most of the projects nearing completion were sanctioned during UPA, three projects in Nagpur, Ahmedabad and Lucknow were approved during Narendra Modi government. Completion of more Metro Rail projects are likely to be an issue during BJP 's election campaign. A total of 537 kms of metro sections are under under construction.An official of housing urban affairs ministry said, ""To speed up Metro expansion in view of growing traffic and pollution, the central government has increased budgetary provision for Metro projects to Rs 42,696 crore during 2015-18, marking an increase of 258% over that of Rs 16,565 crore during 2012-15 period.""He added that the focus has been on ensuring close coordination and monitoring with states and agencies concerned for quick implementation of projects. Four new cities - Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Nagpur - will in the process come on the Metro map of the country taking the number of cities with metro services to 12.The first one to be fully operational will be the 8.5km Metro stretch in Lucknow. It will be opened for public in a fortnight.For the Metro Rail projects implemented under 50:50 equity joint venture model with states concerned, which is the widely followed model, Centre provides assistance up to 20% of project costs excluding land cost in the form of equity coming to about 14% of such cost and subordinate debt accounting for about 6.00%. States make matching contribution with the remaining met from loans.Ministry's data show how the Central share has been in the range of 9.58% and 16.38% of the total project cost.

3.

4. Surgical strikes. I almost never use the phrase, but AK's behaviour in this case was anti-national. Pro-Pak Twitter handles loved him though. Then, he once tweeted [a Pro-Pak and Anti-India article](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Twitter-explodes-with-rage-after-Arvind-Kejriwal-tweets-anti-India-article/articleshow/54562005.cms) I don't even know why. This was literally undermining our foreign policy stance, and AK's supposedly a CM.




5. Blatant hypocrisy and lack of values: Hugging Lalu, tie-ing up with INC, supporting Chitfund Didi. 



6. Blatant opportunism: Immediately turning on an ascendant BJP and gunning for the PM post rather than focusing on their promised objective of ending corruption in Delhi for 5 years and building a base. 



7. Disgusting tweets unbecoming of a CM. 




8. Sheer ego and arrogance: Claim to be the only moral authority, giving ""Corruption-Free Certificates."" Threw out Yogendra Yadav and anyone even slightly critical of him, and it will be Kumar Vishwas' turn soon. 




9. Constant drama and whining. The degree fiasco. All the bullshit of having ""proof"" which he never released on Sheila Dixit, Jaitley, Modi, and numerous others. AK has pioneered blame-game politics, a kind of disgusting hit and run. I hope the defamation cases teach him a lesson. Then, there's the EVM fiasco. This is similar to Mamata's claims of a planned coup a few months earlier, interestingly after a meeting with Kejru.




10. Impressively, single-handedly destroy the hopes of another credible third party rising in the near future. No one will trust it. All the established parties have to do is compare any new entrant to Kejriwal, and voters will flee in droves.



11. Finally, I will let Anna Hazare end my unplanned rant: [Arvind Kejriwal has dashed my hopes: Anna Hazare](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rKOEW4F1htvcGejlPYJfDJ/Arvind-Kejriwal-has-dashed-my-hopes-Anna-Hazare.html)

QUANGZHOU, FUJIAN: ""An India, which registered a growth rate of .001% between 1900 and 1947, has become world's fastest growing economy in its 71st year of Independence under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Modi - who has launched massive programmes on poverty alleviation, women empowerment and skilling the youth,"" said Tarun Vijay, in a key note address at the opening ceremony of high-level BRICS seminar on governance in China.Addressing the high-level meet, attended by China's ministers and party luminaries, besides politicians and scholars from all BRICS nations, Tarun Vijay said that march of a billion people was never so thrilling and reassuring to the world. ""As the vibrant and biggest democracy of the world, India today stands as the centre of pluralism, harmony and peaceful development seen in the growing popularity of our Prime Minister Modi in various parts of the planet,"" he said.Tarun Vijay, a former MP and currently President of India China Parliamentary Group-CII, began his speech on governance quoting Mahatma Gandhi that ""all my windows and doors should remain open to let the noble thoughts come in from all over"" and said that instead of using the word-BRICS community (The term used before him by Chinese official Jiang Jianguo), we prefer to call it a BRICS family- in line with India's message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, meaning world is one family. ""The moment you say family, the entire outlook changes instantly,"" Taun Vijay said drawing huge applause.He cited examples of India's progressive growth chart under Modi, repeatedly mentioning the success of a vibrant democratic polity where a tea seller has become the Prime Minister and a person from the lowest ranks is now the President. The former MP said he is proud to be a member of the world's largest democratic political party, BJP. He spoke about the civilisational and cultural threads between BRICS countries, citing Gandhi's Africa experience and ancient Indian scholars bringing Budhha's teachings to China like Kumarajiva, and Kashyap and also the journeys of Huen Tsang and Fa-Hien who are respected beyond boundaries in India and China.Tarun Vijay also talked about, while discussing the spirit of good governance, the meeting of Prime Minister Modi and President Xi at Astana, where the message given was: let the differences be not allowed to grow into disputes, rather they can be turned into opportunities. He got a thrilling applause by the audience, largely Chinese, when he quoted a Chinese proverb- ""Xiongdi Tongxin Qili Duanjin"", meaning when brothers live together they can solve the most difficult of problems!Tarun Vijay ended his speech, full seven minutes, mentioning the challenge of terrorism and said that ""One country's terrorist is a terrorist to entire humanity and he should be eliminated with collective efforts in the spirit of BRICS declaration at Goa which was agreed upon by all including PM Modi and President Xi.""Interestingly Tarun Vijay was the only speaker who discussed threat of terrorism in his speech.

**An Insignificant Man: Film on Arvind Kejriwal cleared by FCAT without any cuts** 

 ______ 
An Insignificant Man cleared by FCAT, makers call previous CBFC demands ‘ridiculous’. An Insignificant Man cleared by FCAT, makers call previous CBFC demands ‘ridiculous’.

Directors Khushboo Ranka and Vinay Shukla had begun their journey to make An Insignificant Man by following Arvind Kejriwal on his election campaign in late 2012. The film may have featured at various film festivals, it however faced trouble back home for a row with the CBFC. But now the film has manage to obtain a clearance from Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) without any cuts.

The decision came days after Prasoon Joshi took over as the new CBFC chief. Director Khushboo exclusively spoke to indianexpress.com. Calling the previous CBFC demands ‘ridiculous’, she said, “We definitely feel vindicated because it was a ridiculous demand in the first place and it would have been very harmful and dangerous for filmmakers. So, of course there is a personal victory as it helps us to show the film to a larger audience but it also shows the arbitrary nature of the revising and examining committee because I don’t know if this should have been in the first place itself. But the larger message for the filmmakers from this is that they should make political films, the films showing immediate reality.”

She added, “We have just got the FCAT order so we are yet to decide on the release date. We have plans in set how to reach to the maximum audience.”

Earlier too, the film’s official twitter handle had come out in support of the removal of former CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani, who had asked the makers to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit and Kejriwal himself, before the movie could be granted a censor certificate.

Reacting to this, the makers had said over tweets, “People who have been asking us if the change at the censor board will help the release of ‘An Insignificant Man’, sadly the answer is ‘No’. “Our film has already been seen by 2 CBFC committees (i) Examining Committee (ii) Revising Committee. Both reacted adversely to the film.”

“The EC refused to talk to us while the RC asked us to get NOCs and bleep out names of Congress and BJP. That’s their final word on our film. Our only hope right now is the FCAT (Film Certification Appellate Tribunal). We appealed against the CBFC’s decision at the FCAT and our hearing has already taken place. Our hearing took place last month and we presented our case to the FCAT. We are now awaiting the final verdict from them. Fingers crossed,” read the tweets.

Now, with the FCAT’s approval, the documentary has cleared all hurdles to explore the life of Kejriwal, one of the popular political leaders in the country right now. Produced by Anand Gandhi of Ships of Theseus fame, the film received a standing ovation at the Toronto International Film Festival last year and apparently got sold out screenings at Busan International Film Festival and BFI London Film Festival.

**I favour PM Modi, not Amit Shah: Mamata Banerjee** 

 ______ 
KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee shifted the goalposts in her war against the Narendra Modi government by targeting BJP president Amit Shah instead of the Prime Minister against whom she had been rallying all these days over demonetization and GST.""I favour Narendra Modi, not Amit Shah. I don't blame the PM. Why should I blame him? His party should take care of it,"" the West Bengal chief minister said in an interview to a television channel. Her focus was on the ""environment of super dictatorship in the country"" in which a party president was meddling in government affairs.Saying so, the Bengal CM heaped praises on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ""He is also a BJP man... but he was very balanced and impartial. We worked under him and never faced any problem,"" Mamata said. Coming back to the present, she blamed the BJP and not the PM for all the ills. ""But why are we facing problems today? I do not want to blame the prime minister but his party should take care. Why is his party creating problems for everyone?"" the CM said.The sudden change of stance took the opposition by surprise, when it came from none other than Mamata, the new face of the opposition in the country. The Bengal CM took exception to the BJP president's presence in an official meeting conducted by a Union minister. ""Everybody is scared. Super dictatorship is going on. How can a party president take a meeting of ministers? Who is the PM, Modi or Shah,"" said Mamata Banerjee.However, this didn't stop Mamata from sending out the message of change at the Centre in 2019. ""The Opposition parties have come on a platform and there will be change (at the Centre) in 2019. We are waiting for the change... No front has been formed as yet, but the opposition parties have come on a platform and have started working. Wait for six months. Things will be clear,"" the CM said during an interaction 'Rising Bengal 2017'.

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Claims of over Rs 7700 Cr have been paid to over 90 lakh farmers in the Kharif season of 2016 and Rabi season of 2016-17, the Prime Minister was informed on Monday at a high-level meeting to review the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.Officials also told PM Narendra Modi that latest technology including smartphones, remote sensing, satellite data and drones are being used for speedy data collection with regard to crop insurance claims. Senior officials from Ministry of Agriculture, NITI Aayog and PMO were present during the meeting, as per a PMO statement.The Prime Minister also reviewed the progress of another key scheme related to the agriculture sector - Soil Health Cards. He was informed that 16 States/UTs have completed the first cycle of Soil Health Cards distribution, and the remaining States are likely to complete the same within weeks.Reviewing the progress, the Prime Minister said that appropriate checks should be undertaken for variation, both within a sampling grid, and across different soil testing labs, as per a PMO statement. This would help ensure quality in the reports, he added.The Prime Minister also emphasized that soil health cards should be printed in the local dialect of the area, so that the farmers are able to read and understand them easily.Encouraging the rapid adoption of latest technology, the Prime Minister said that soil testing should eventually be possible through hand-held devices. He urged officials to explore the possibility of involving start-ups and entrepreneurs in this exercise.

5.Hugging Lalu. Of all the satanic sins done by Indian politicians, truly this takes the cake for being the worst, right? 

6\.First, it was not Kejriwal's idea to run for LS polls. 2nd, having bigger ambitions is not opportunism. What Nitish Kumar has done in Bihar is what you call 'opportunist'. Ditched his own principles for power.

7\. not a valid reason. he's not a politician. he acts like a citizen and abuse like one. 

8\. Yogendra Yadav turned against his party. He didn't throw him out, their whole party did! i dont care what he do with his party until he's fulfilling his promises.

11\. where was Anna Hazare when hundreds of farmers died in MP? He's a [BJP agent](http://viralinindia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/C-jtSV-VwAAvZZJ.jpg). He only appears when it has anything to do with kejriwal. His voice died down after Modi came to power. where's Lokapal now? Has it arrived? Was his movement just confined to Congress? I think, yes.

12\. because media doesn't show his work. because people are being misinformed about what is happening in Delhi. because people need to know the standards they are setting in Delhi for other states to replicate. and, because HE CAN.

**Why Doklam standoff is not good for Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of BRICS Summit, CPC Congress** 

 ______ 
Most of the border trespasses or infringements by troops occur due to overenthusiastic local commanders, who just go overboard. The senior poeple or the decision makers in the government come into the picture a little later and take a stand with certain objectives in mind. But, Doklam seems to be a different case .

As reports from the ground suggest, Doklam standoff began after Chinese troops pulled down a couple of watchtowers and followed it up by destroying two bunkers built by the Indian Army for logistic support for patrolling in the region. Chinese troops were in the region to construct a highway.

The Doklam move by the People's Liberation Army of China has come in accordance with the broad Chinese policy towards border relations with India. Chinese policy has had three contours:

To strengthen its infrastructure by building roads, bridges and other permanent structures in the region where China is in stronger position

To further 'salami slicing' in areas where both Indian and Chinese troops jostle for dominance and patrol at different times

in areas where both Indian and Chinese troops jostle for dominance and patrol at different times To needle India from time to time to test water where Chinese are in weaker position

Doklam has elements of both second and third contours of border policy. On ground, Indian forces occupy the edge of the hills and hence are in stronger position but this region is patrolled by the troops of both the sides. Indian troops have been patrolling the site of standoff for decades while Chinese do come and go occasionally.

Now that the Doklam standoff is in its third month, Chinese objectives seem to have fallen in disarray. The Doklam standoff is most likely to damage the standing of Chinese President Xi Jinping both domestically and internationally. China cannot pull back its troops without losing its face and staying there is posing problems to Beijing and Xi Jinping.

BRICS UNDER DOKLAM SHADOW

The ninth BRICS Summit is slated for September 3-5 and will be held at Xiamen in China. This year's theme of the BRICS Summit is ""Stronger Partnership for a Brighter Future"" but Doklam standoff has put a question mark on ""Partnership"".

Responding to a question last, the Ministry of External Affairs said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation was not yet certain. MEA spokesperson Ravish Kumar said, ""At this stage I can't confirm about PM Modi going to China. I will let you know if there are any further developments in this regard.""

If PM Modi does not take part in the BRICS Summit in the wake of Doklam standoff, it will be a second major snub to Xi Jinping after his One Belt On Road initiative. Modi staying from BRICS would also mean a 'flop' Summit that Xi Jinping can hardly afford at a time when it is pushing hard to emerge as the strongest economic superpower in the world especially when US President Donald Trump is being viewed as 'unpredictable' in his policies.

Since its first summit in 2009, BRICS has been the alternative economic voice of the world in contrast to the one dominated by the US and European Union.

China and India have worked together at several other platforms including the World Economic Forum, the World Trade Organisation as BRICS partners to prevent the western bloc from having its say on key issues including agriculture and climate change. It will not augur well for Xi Jinping if Xiamen BRICS Summit fails after a rather successful Goa edition last year in India.

19TH CONGRESS OF CPC

The Communist Party of China will be holding its 19th Congress later this year. It is expected to be held in two months after the BRICS Summit. Dates are not yet final but Xi Jinping will surely try to consolidate his position in the Congress, which will see a new make-up of the top leadership.

The polit buro and polit buro standing committee will get a new look. On account of age, only Xi Jinping and Chinese Premier Le Kiqiang will enter the new polit buro of the CPC. Speculations are rife that Xi Jinping has plans to fill the posts in the polit buro standing committee with his own proteges. But, with Doklam not going China's way, Xi Jinping may find some opposition in the Congress.

DIPLOMATIC DISTRESS OVER DOKLAM

China has not got much support from the international community over Doklam. Ever since, the standoff over Doklam began, China insisted that India should withdraw before any talks could be held. After two months, none of the countries has come in its support. Not even Pakistan has said it openly.

On the other hand, the US, the UK and Japan have backed India's stand one way or the other. While the US and the UK said that India and China should resolve the standoff bilaterally through dialogue, Japan went further to accuse China of being provocative saying that ""no one should try to change the status quo"" what the PLA tried to do by attempting to build a highway in the disputed region.

China's 'salami slicing' policy may see India deepening its strategic ties with the US and Japan further. Chinese expansionist policy is being challenged in the east by the US-Vietnam-Japan alliance. India may work more closely with the already existing alliance making it more difficult for Xi Jinping in explaining Doklam standoff to his own partymen.

While Doklam standoff continued, India, the US and Japan held annual Malabar Naval Exercise. Australia has been keen on joining the naval exercise for some time. India had in the past cited some technical issue. But, Following Doklam, India may walk a few extra miles to let Australia join the Malabar exercise. China is the biggest trading partner of Australia. If Australia joins the Malabar exercise, which China sees as directed against it, Xi Jinping may actually see an ally drifting a bit.

One of the objectives of Doklam standoff appears to be winning away Bhutan from India. But, after India stood its ground firm, this Chinese objective does not seem to be fulfilled this time around. This will come as another failure of Xi Jinping. Bhutan continues to be the only Chinese neighbour having no diplomatic relation with it.

Doklam standoff is turning out to be second successive loss of face for Xi Jinping with regard to his India policy after New Delhi snubbed China over One Belt One Road initiative. This follows a very pompous visit by Xi Jinping to India in 2014 and a successful Goa BRICS Summit last year.

XI JINPING'S THRID TERM AMBITION

It is being widely speculated that Xi Jinping may push for a tradition-breaking third term as the President of China. No Chinese President after Mao Zedong has enjoyed such a long term in office. But, Xi Jinping has been dropping hints about his ambitious plan.

In 2016, Xi Jinping got his position elevated to the ""core leader"". This year, Xi Jinping became the first Chinese leader after Mao to be publicly addressed by the PLA forces as the ""Chairman"". But, with Doklam mishandling, Xi Jinping may find it difficult to explain his stand in the Congress. Xi Jinping is said to be keen to get the approval of the Congress for another term in 2022. The CPC Congress is held every five years.

Despite high-octane cries for war and rhetoric of 1962, a full-fledged war over Doklam is not worth for China. And, Xi Jinping cannot expect India to back off over short war. Chinese army cannot have its say at Doklam because Indian troops are better positioned strategically.

To make India reconsider its stand over Doklam, China will have to escalate it over other sectors of boundary or use air force. Both will send wrong signals to the world and bring two nuclear powers in direct conflict. This may also work against Chinese emphasis on economic geo-strategy. Doklam standoff has left Xi Jinping in, what could be called, a constipated situation.

**Where does the educated Indian emigrate to** 

 ______ 
In his speech at Silicon Valley in September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the so-called brain drain is actually brain gain — “a brain deposit that is waiting for an opportunity to be of use to the motherland”.

That deposit is multiplying fast. According to a report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), highly educated Indians were the fastest growing set of emigrants to OECD countries in the decade to 2011. The OECD countries include 34 wealthy countries (with high per capita income) such as the US, Australia, Israel, South Korea and several European nations.

Look at the numbers. The overall migrant population of Indian origin in developed countries was 3.6 million in 2010-11, an increase of 83% over the previous decade. But the growth in the population of highly educated Indians was even faster at 123%. At 2.24 million, highly educated Indians are 62% of total Indian origin migrants. This rate is higher than for migrants from other Asian countries such as Singapore (55.8%), Philippines (52.3%) and China (43.8%).

When it came to highly educated individuals, Indians were the most populous at 2.24 million, but Mexico an OECD country itself sent the most number of people about 12 million to other OECD nations.

With only about 8% of Indians being graduates, according to Census 2011 numbers, this means that about three out of every 100 highly educated Indians work or study abroad, a rate which has marginally increased between 2000-2001 and 2010-11. The numbers are higher for doctors and nurses with about eight out of every 100 of them migrating to a developed country.

Note that as of January 2015, OECD nations accounted for about one-fifth of the total non-resident Indian population, according to the ministry of overseas Indian affairs (though the comparable OECD report numbers don’t strictly match). So the migration rate of Indians may be even higher as move to other countries such as those in the Gulf.

The OECD’s 34 member-states are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal. Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and US.

Experts say this brain drain highlights the lack of job opportunities that match up to education levels, and underlines concerns over India losing its assets. The numbers have also increased sharply because of a surge in the number of Indians opting for tertiary education.

“India is clearly a huge knowledge economy. The number of professionals produced in different areas is very huge and hence the number of emigrants appears larger,” said Jayan Jose Thomas, assistant professor at IIT Delhi. In comparison with countries such as China, India has the added advantage of many of its population being fluent in English, which in turn allows them to integrate well in Anglophone countries such as the US, UK and Canada.

The OECD report lays particular stress on the migration of health professionals. India saw the highest number of doctors move to OECD countries in 2010-11. Over 86,000 doctors from India were working in OECD countries in 2010-11, with Chinese doctors coming a distant second at just over 26,000. India also had the second-highest number of nurses working in these countries at 70,471.

“India does produce a large number of doctors as compared to other countries. Hence while the total number of doctors moving to other countries is higher, the expatriation rate is quite low,” Thomas added. As of 2010-11, the expatriation rate for doctors from India to OECD countries stood at 8.6%.

This is relatively low, especially compared to that of its neighbours Sri Lanka (28.3%), Pakistan (11%) and Nepal (22.3%). India’s expatriation rate for nurses was only 5.4%. China’s, though, was much less (language may play a role in this), with the expatriation rate for both doctors and nurses at only around 1%.

With the health infrastructure already poor in India, the loss of doctors and nurses acts as a double whammy for the country. According to a report by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the doctor-population ratio in India as of 2013 was 1:1800 -- much lower than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommended ratio of 1:1000.

Does India stand to lose out via this “brain drain”? Opinions differ, but it is clear that India has made a lot of effort to engage with its diaspora, as the much-hyped Pravasi Bharatiya Divas testifies.

However, data on how successful these efforts have been is hard to come by, other than the fact that remittances have increased. China has been more successful in this regard. It runs an aggressive programme to attract skilled members of its diaspora. A United Nations report quoted statistics from China’s ministry of education which put the number of Chinese overseas students returning at 272,900 in 2012 -- an increase of 46.57% from 2011.

**Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Purohit gets bail; Congress accuses govt of ‘protecting all RSS-connected accused’** 

 ______ 
Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit. Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit.

The Congress and the BJP government on Monday traded barbs at each other, with the former accusing the latter of “protecting” all the accused “connected to the RSS” after the Supreme Court granted bail to Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit, the key accused in the 2008 Malegaon serial blasts case. The opposition party also raised questions over National Investigation Agency (NIA) chief Sharad Kumar getting two extensions and expressed hope that justice would be delivered in the case “without fear or favour”.

“Col Purohit gets Bail. It was expected as the present BJP Govt is protecting all the accused connected with RSS in all Bomb Blast cases (sic),” Congress leader Digivijaya Singh wrote on Twitter. “NIA chief has been given two extensions to ensure their acquittal. He may now be further rewarded for a suitable post retirement position (sic),” he said, in another tweet.

Col Purohit gets Bail. It was expected as the present BJP Govt is protecting all the accused connected with RSS in all Bomb Blast cases. — digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28) August 21, 2017

Echoing similar views, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of communications department Randeep Singh Surjewala wondered why the Narendra Modi-led government was struggling to find an efficient police officer to head the NIA, so much so that it gave two extensions to its current chief. “Why is that the (Narendra) Modi government cannot find any competent police officer in India to head the NIA that they have to give two extensions to its current chief?

“We sincerely hope that the law will take its own course and justice will be done, free from fear or favour, in this case,” he added.

Dismissing Congress’ accusations, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju hit back at the Congress and said whoever deserved justice would get it. “What is the conspiracy about it? The Congress has the habit of raising this issue. Why should we intervene? This is a process (that was) started a long time back and it’s a process of the judiciary. Why should we intervene?

“Whosoever deserves justice will get it. My saying anything won’t change it,” he told mediapersons on the sidelines of an event of the border guarding force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). He also refrained from responding to Digvijaya Singh’s comment on the issue. “He (Singh) has the habit of saying all these things. Why should I respond to that?,” the minister said.

Meanwhile, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi accused the Modi-led government of going soft on the cases where the Hindus are alleged accused. “In the larger picture, since 2014, since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the charge at the Centre, there has been a pattern in such cases. All the cases involving the Hindus as the alleged accused are dropped,” Owaisi was quoted as saying by ANI. Stating that everyone has the right to bail, Owaisi questioned as to why it is not being granted to Muslims, Dalits and tribals.

While setting aside the Bombay High Court order which denied him the bail, the apex court stated that it has imposed certain conditions on Purohit, who spent eight years and eight months in jail. The Supreme Court said Purohit would not leave India with prior permission of the court and not directly or indirectly make any inducement to any witnesses.

Seven people were killed in the bomb blast that took place on September 29, 2008, at Malegaon, a communally-sensitive textile town in Nasik district of north Maharashtra.

**View: Islamic terrorism is the real enemy, the rest just anti-India smear campaigns** 

 ______ 
Terror revisited Spain with tragic results last week as a bunch of madmen ran amok in the heart of Barcelona killing half-a-dozen people and injuring many more. The scale of the terror and destruction bears little resemblance to the carnage visited upon another Spanish city thirteen years ago but that does not make it any less criminal and cowardly.In 2004, as the attention of much of Spain was focused on the general election a few days away, serial bomb blasts ripped through the heart of Madrid’s commuter train system in morning rush hour killing nearly 200 people. The attacks ignited public anger, unseated the centre-right government in the elections that immediately followed and led to the exit of Spanish troops from Iraq.In terms of scale, devastation and implications for Spain’s relationship with its important partners, the Madrid attacks were a terrible, unforgettable tragedy. It seemed to reinforce the view that Western aggression was the root of cause of Muslim anger with transgressions like the Iraq war (Spain initially sent troops) only fanning the flames of Al-Qaeda-style radicalism.Conservatives, academics and researchers who believed otherwise, who believed that this rise of Islamic fundamentalism/terrorism had nothing to do with justice but was instead, an attempt to seek global domination for one demented worldview with its roots in Salafism, a belief in return to the Caliphate and a contempt for other religions, were unfortunately on the backfoot. Events thereafter appear to prove this Leftist worldview.George W Bush’s muscular war on terror foundered due to inept handling and a lost campaign in Iraq; Barack Obama’s ascendancy and Cairo speech of 2009 seemed to suggest that the US would deemphasise combat as a way to counter the spread of Salafism/fundamentalism. In India , the setbacks to the BJP and the ascendancy of the Congress/Left style of politics dealt a blow to the belief that the vile terrorist ideology can be countered by aggressive policing at home and a no-nonsense approach towards truculent neigh neighbours.Appeasement, lackadaisical approach and the bogey of ‘Hindu terror’ were the ‘weapons’ in Congress-UPA government’s arsenal against Islamic terror! Scale and destruction apart, there is one more crucial difference in the response to the Barcelona attack. And that difference is important because it just shows how the liberal/Leftist worldview on Islamic terror has changed dramatically in light of the Islamist terror rampage across countries. Madrid was Spain’s fault, Aznar (former Spain PM, Jose Maria Aznar) fault just like 9/11, which was blamed on everything from CIA activities to American troops in Saudi Arabia and support for Israel.In India, this manifested itself in a ‘hate-Modi’ campaign which looked at every terrorist attack on home soil through the prism of Gujarat. Attempt was made to link every atrocity to what happened in Gujarat so as to suggest that somehow that Narendra Modi was responsible for all the tragedies. The bottom started falling out of this insidious campaign when the terrorists refused to play ball. Far from being freedom fighters interested only in Kashmir/Palestine liberation, they showed their true colours with the rise of ISIS and the campaign of terror unleashed on the heart of Europe. For liberals, it was a painful decision.Difficult to blame western imperialism when innocent Germans, Belgians and Spaniards are being slaughtered. Difficult also to blame ISIS atrocities on Iraq war when France, which had nothing to do with it, is attacked. The silence on Barcelona from the usual ‘blame-the-west’ gang exemplifies this confusion. The latest liberal smear effort is to equate the thugs of Charlottesville with terrorist scumbags of ISIS and Al-Qaeda . Make no mistake, there is a lot of difference between ISIS and the white nationalist/supremacist gangs or groups in the US. The former is a disaster for civilisation as we know it.The latter are a localised danger to parts of American society if allowed to grow and become big, especially with their vile, racist rhetoric. That’s it. They are not a national or an international security threat on the scale of ISIS. A similar effort is underway in India to link fringe Hindu groups with Taliban in Afghanistan. There is an even more sinister effort to paint Hindu/Indian society as intolerant and anti-Muslim and out to deny minority rights Recent articles in international publications point to a larger effort in this direction. India we are told is seeing aggressive Hindutva, rising Hindu intolerance. This will be used at next available opportunity to smear Indian society, to wash off the sins of Islamic radical preachers and extremists and whitewash the depredations of Islamic terrorists from across the border.We have seen this movie before and know how it is going to play out. Liberals in India and the west are no different when it comes to smear tactics or acting as apologists for Islamic terror.They know the real villain is Islamic terrorism . But much like their forefathers who whitewashed the sins of Soviet communism in the name of the fight of justice or equality, the modern day liberals and Leftists in the west and India will cry ‘wolf ’ at non-existent threats from white nationalist groups in the US and or allegedly militant Hindus in India to hide the real problem of Islamic fundamentalism. The game has just begun.

482,"""Next you'll blame Modi for deliberately holding back northern economies just so that people have to migrate.""

No, they were doing a good enough job of that before Modi got in power. 

The only reason that the central government in New Delhi tolerates explosive population growth in the BIMARU states and Gangetic belt is because those Indians are culturally similar to the ones in power in the central government. 

If Karnataka and Tamil Nadu wanted to have 100 million people in each state (they would never do that because these cultures know how to plan a good society), and the state governments were doing little to nothing to address the problem, you would see central government in New Delhi step in relatively quickly with their own version of population control measures.

That is because the South Indians don't speak Hindi and generally make India less homogeneous.

The central government is okay with these states nursing these massive populations and sending them all over the rest of India in search of a better life, because that is also how they homogenize the nation and give us a lingua franca in Hindi. 

If these BIMARU states weren't Hindi speaking and Hindu you would finally see some good population control measures introduced. ",2017-08-21 23:28:43

 ______ 
I congratulate Thiru O Panneerselvam &amp; others who took oath today. I hope Tamil Nadu scales newer heights of progress in the years to come. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1503316450000

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed the merger of AIADMK 's two factions on Monday and said the Centre would provide all support to chief minister E Palaniswami and deputy CM O Panneerselvam for Tamil Nadu's growth.""I congratulate Thiru O Panneerselvam and others who took oath today. I hope Tamil Nadu scales newer heights of progress in the years to come,"" Modi tweeted.It is believed the BJP leadership, including Modi and party chief Amit Shah , played a crucial role in the merger as it comes with the opportunity for the saffron party to consolidate itself in the southern state.There is also the possibility of the merged entity joining the NDA at the Centre, which will consolidate the ruling dispensation further following Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) coming on board. There is speculation BJP will use the opportunity to forge a pre-poll alliance with ADMK with V K Sasikala 's sympathisers sidelined.ADMK has 50 members in Parliament, including 37 in Lok Sabha and 13 in Rajya Sabha and their presence on the treasury benches will be a boost to NDA. Soon after Sasikala was jailed after her conviction on corruption charges, BJP began taking keen interest in Tamil Nadu politics, striving for unity among ADMK rival factions. As a weakened AIADMK could have seen rival DMK making gains and subsequently helping Congress, BJP leaders left no stone unturned to unite the two factions. Modi held several rounds of separate meetings with Panneerselvam and Palaniswami.Both leaders were invited to the oath-taking ceremony of Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, making it clear that the BJP brass wanted to keep both factions in good humour.After Jayalalitha's death, BJP kept away as Sasikala took over as general secretary. BJP members were not ready to join hands with someone facing graft charges. The BJP leadership was equally apprehensive when Sasikala imposed her nephew TTV Dinkaran on the party. However, after Dinakaran was held for misuse of money in the assembly bypolls, BJP found it easier to convince the two factions to merge.

**India to put Chabahar rail link on fast track** 

 ______

New Delhi: Questioning the seriousness of India’s intent, Iran has sought a firm commitment from New Delhi that the construction of the $1.6 billion rail link from Chabahar port will be taken up expeditiously, two people aware of the development said.

India has promised to remove hurdles to fast track the project, which will connect the port on the southern coast of the Gulf nation to the eastern city of Zahedan on the border with Afghanistan.

The issue came up for discussion during the visit of minister for road transport and highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari to Iran for the swearing-in ceremony of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the two people said, requesting anonymity.

“The minister has ordered to take up the matter with IRCON (IRCON International Ltd, the state-run company to which the contact was given) on priority and sort out the matter,” an Indian government official, one of the two cited above said.

India plans to develop the Chabahar port, which would give it access to landlocked Afghanistan and energy-rich Central Asia through its Jawaharlal Nehru and Kandla ports on the west coast, circumventing Pakistan.

But the agreement to build the 500-km rail link lapsed in April.

“During deliberations, the Iranian government asked the Indian delegation if it was serious about building the railway link as no efforts seem to have come up,” said the second person, also an Indian government official.

In May 2016, India and Iran inked 12 agreements including one for India’s IRCON to build the 500-km railway line as part of a transit corridor to Afghanistan. The agreements were signed in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Iran.

“They complained that the agreement had lapsed and IRCON hasn’t informed if it has managed to arrange for the funds for the rail project. The Indian delegation sought time and assured the Iranian government about India’s commitment,” the second official cited above said.

India has already built a 218-km road link connecting Delaram with Zaranj in Afghanistan, which is adjacent to the border with Iran. The Chabahar port, located in Sistan-Baluchestan province on Iran’s south-eastern coast, will also promote India’s strategic interests in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz.

Experts say procedural issues should be resolved fast by India to leverage the opportunity that Iran offers.

“There is a positive movement. The Indian government is very focussed on its intent to move forward on Chabahar port which is a strategic project and forms an integral part of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). We will have to sort out the procedural issues and sustain the momentum,” said Meena Singh Roy, a research fellow at New Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA).

Chabahar can be leveraged by India for the INSTC which will connect the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf with the Caspian Sea through Iran and then onwards to St. Petersburg in Russia and northern Europe. China on its part is pushing for its ambitious “One Belt One Road” initiative aimed at connecting around 60 countries across Asia, Africa and Europe.

“There has to be fast movement on the commitments made. This time there is push from the top. If we don’t sustain the momentum, the opportunity will not wait for us,” Roy added.

Indian projects in Iran have been facing inordinate delays. An Indian consortium comprising ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) that won a bid for the Farsi block in 2002 from National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) is yet to secure the development rights.

Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Iranian embassy in New Delhi, IRCON and India’s ministries of shipping and external affairs on 11 August remained unanswered.

Interestingly, China’s ZPMC has won a contract to supply cranes to the Chabahar port, The Hindu Business Line reported on 11 August.

The Chabahar port, located in the Gulf of Oman near Iran’s border with Pakistan, is less than 100km from Pakistan’s Chinese-constructed port of Gwadar, part of a project to open up an energy and trade corridor from the Gulf to western China.

**Bihar’s Srijan Scandal part IV: Funds diverted, drug-less health centre told patients, ‘Make do’**

In the absence of government funds that remained parked illegally with the Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti, a primary health care centre in Sabour block has remained without antibiotics, an ultrasound machine and a woman doctor for years; over 150 farmers displaced due to the Pirpaiti power plant continue to wait for compensation; and over a dozen city bylanes and drains await repair and construction. Officials suspect that given the scale of the Rs 700-crore scam, many other such district schemes may well be stuck.

An investigation by The Indian Express shows that Rs 275 crore was siphoned off from the Land Acquisition Department, while the Mukhyamantri Nagar Vikas Yojana and Health Department deposited Rs 10.26 crore and Rs 10.75 crore with Srijan respectively. As a registered society, Srijan was not authorised to function as a bank or accept such high-value deposits.

The scam was exposed when a Rs 270-crore Land Acquisition Department cheque presented at Bank of Baroda bounced on August 4. Bhagalpur District Magistrate Adarsh Titarmare conducted an internal inquiry and found that the government account didn’t have funds, following which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar sent an Economic Offences Unit team to Bhagalpur.

Nine FIRs have been filed in the case so far, and the number of arrests is up to 18. One of them died on Monday reportedly due to an illness. The Bhagalpur police on Sunday evening also raided premises of five associates of Srijan founder secretary Manorama Devi.

A look at the victims of the scam:

HEALTH

The PHC at Sabour block town is located barely 500 metres from the Srijan office. A small line stands before Dr Ajay Kumar Singh at the out-patient department. As he examines the patients, Dr Singh says he can prescribe from only among 10-odd medicines to his patients, mainly paracetamol, vitamin tablets, cough syrup, ointments, eye or ear drops. Though the PHC has antibiotics for children, these are not available for adults, and he asks several to buy them from the open market. The PHC gets about 100 patients daily (except Sunday).

There is a functioning lab for routine tests, but no ultrasound machine. While the six beds at the PHC are essentially for delivery cases, the centre has no woman doctor. Says a patient, Bachchu Das, “We complain, but the PHC always cites funds crunch. ‘Bas kaam chalao (make do with what is there)’, is a common answer.”

Another patient, Rajesh Mandal, who has heard about the Srijan scam, says, “We always suspected the outfit. But why blame Srijan when government officials connived with it? When protectors turn looters, what can be done?”Dr Singh directed queries regarding “constraints” to PHC in-charge

Dr Singh directed queries regarding “constraints” to PHC in-charge Dr Rajkumar Choudhary, who was on leave.

LAND ACQUISITION

Between 2008 and 2011, the state government acquired 988 acres for setting up the Pirpaiti power plant. Originally planned as a thermal plant, it will now be a 1,338-acre solar power unit. Among the 969 local farmers who gave their land for the project, 150 are yet to get compensation, ranging from amounts Rs 30 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

The last promise was for payment in August-September this year. However, then came the news that the Land Acquisition Department’s Rs 270 crore cheque had bounced. Mohammed Farooq, who is to get his Rs 30 lakh, says, “We stalled construction at the plant.”

Munna Singh, who is due Rs 70 lakh for his land, says the department had been delaying payment on some excuse or the other. “They claimed there was no money. Now, after the Srijan scam expose, we know why. We need the money and will not allow construction at the power plant site till all farmers get compensation,” says Singh.

Sheikh Azmat, who is to receive Rs 50 lakh, says the delay in compensation money has affected their plans for their fields as well as education of their children.

MUKHYAMANTRI NAGAR VIKAS YOJANA

The state’s pet town planning scheme promises road and drains repair and construction, besides construction of pavements and development of parks. Bhagalpur has 51 wards, and work on their roads and drains largely depends on the availability and sanction of funds under the flagship scheme.

An open drain running along the boundary wall of Bhagalpur Central Cooperative Bank is an example of what the scheme has actually come to. The bank incidentally is also being investigated for transferring Rs 48 crore to Srijan.

Says resident Rajiv Kumar, “When a government department cannot get sanction for construction of a drain in front of its building, how can common people get a road or nullah repair sanctioned?”

While Bhagalpur DM Aadesh Titarmare could not be contacted, a municipal corporation official admitted, “Non-construction of some roads may not be directly linked to siphoning of funds, but it did affect town planning.”

A Collectorate official cited the Srijan scam to say why they couldn’t be of more help. They were busy providing documents to police, he claimed. “Even routine meetings are not being held. We can take questions after the Srijan dust settles a bit,” said a senior Bhagalpur officer.

BOX

Accused dead, RJD says ‘another Vyapam’

Welfare Department clerk-grade official Mahesh Mandal, who had been arrested in connection with the Srijan scam, died of kidney failure at Bhagalpur’s Mayaganj hospital on Monday. He had been put on dialysis soon after his arrest last week.

Mandal, 57, who needed dialysis every three-four days, would go for treatment to Mumbai, with the family spending Rs 1 lakh per month on flights from Patna. His son Shiv Mandal is a JD(U) leader.

After his death, Mandal’s relatives protested against the hospital administration, accusing them of not taking proper care of him. His brother Dinesh Mandal said: “We suspect foul play as my brother could have exposed several politicians involved in the scam.”

Denying the charges, Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said: “We admitted Mandal to hospital soon after his arrest.” A Mayaganj hospital official said postmortem had revealed water in Mandal’s lungs, reported in case of renal complications.

The opposition RJD, that stalled the Assembly’s opening day proceedings over the Srijan scam and floods, said there couldn’t be a fair probe under the present government. Former CM Rabri Devi said, “CM Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi should resign.”

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said, “The first death in the Srijan scam has been reported. Srijan is getting bigger than Vyapam scam.”
