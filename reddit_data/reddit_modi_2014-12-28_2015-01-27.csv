0,"Those are not just two riots, see that Firstpost link. Modi's only redeeming claim vis a vis 2002 riots has been that there have been no riots in the state since, which is a lie. Now figure how many lies he must have sold to be where he is now. And we know how many riots Gujarats has seen, but none of the CMs responsible for those are PMs, so pardon us for thinking of the well being of our country and not talking about those ones.

The point is that it you don't always need fundamental institutional changes to improve accountability and reduce corruption. You can make the same systems, the same bureaucracy work for the people by making small, incremental changes on the ground. This is what Modi promised in his campaign speeches, this is what I expected from him while voting, and this is what he is delivering now that he is in power.

11,"&gt; So what has brought Indian inflation to 4.3 per cent? As has been mentioned umpteen times in this column, the primary determinant of inflation in India is not what the RBI does, but what the Central government (ministry of agriculture) does. The last minimum support price (MSP) increase by the UPA government, in March 2014 for the kharif crops, was 8.2 per cent versus 6.1 per cent in March 2013. The sheer audacity of the Sonia Gandhi-led government to increaseMSPs at such a large rate in March 2014 was, of course only paralleled by its belief that inflation did not matter for votes.

&gt; The first MSP of the Modi-led government was in October 2014, and the order of magnitude was (-)0.3 per cent — no typo there, minus 0.3 per cent — the seventh lowest change in 38 years. Of course, the fact that food inflation is down this year is not because of the rabi crop MSP for 2015. This policy will have its lowering effect next year, when inflation is likely to be close to 4 per cent, regardless of what the RBI does. (RBI, are you listening?)",2014-12-28 01:52:26

Of course, it is winning elections, but that is not because people love the BJP more, but because they hate the opposition, especially the Congress, even more.

Ironically the man accused most of crony corruption has driven Agriculture to grow at 10%+ for a decade (national average is 3%, pre Modi Guj agri grew at 2%). Jaya in this tenure of hers has done wonders for agriculture.

[1](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/If-one-takes-agriculture-as-index-of-inclusive-development-Gujarats-agrarian-miracle-stands-out/articleshow/34123983.cms?), [2](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/gujarats-decade-of-agricultural-success/article4746933.ece). 

What is interesting is, subsidies were knocked out and the private sector roped in. 

The problem is, a lot of agricultural reform comes under the ambit of the states, and it is up to the states to take the big steps.

&gt; As for manufacturing being the global solution, could you elaborate why?

Pure Economics. Agriculture cannot (historically at least) sustain a large population. Sure it can sustain it, but it cannot grow it. THe model has usually been Primary &gt; Secondary &gt; Tertiary. Advanced economies usually go through this transformation, and finally reach a stage where the Tertiary sector drives the economy.

Problem with India is, we leaped from a Primary &gt; Tertiary. This means a lot of people are either outright unemployed or there is rampant hidden unemployment as in the case of the Agri sector.

Manufacturing generates jobs, and exportable surplus (which the services sector also does, but it employs far less number of people). This is why even in India, some of the advanced (relative to India) states with low unemployment are the heavily industrialised states while those who are primarily Agriculture driven (like Bihar or UP) suffer from all the perils of being an agrarian economy.

Based on the above table you cannot claim ""66% girls in State A have reported sexual abuse which is highest in the country"". Only 3% girls in State A have reported sexual abuse, and that figure is actually the lowest in the country.

&gt; The news article guy is less at fault as their source, the Wings report does read like there are 63% of all girls.

So, the ""news article guy"" - a professional journalist is ""less at fault"" for

* Completely misreporting the numbers
* Not checking source which is clearly mentioned in the article
* Stating that this is a _recent_ status update, when the numbers are from 2007
* Putting Gujarat in headline and mentioning Narendra Modi in the opening para (a clear attempt at politicization)

one thing i do see happening is BJP going all soft hindutva. there will be a more hardline party coming up for sure. and MIM kinds of parties will also come to the forefront. people of all religions who vote on religious lines are fed up with status quoists like current bjp leadership and current congress leaders and other 'secular' parties who don't really do anything for religion apart from play it for their own ends. so the ones who vote on religion are going to get more hardline parties to vote for, both hindu as well as muslim.

This is the most weird piece of logic I have ever heard to explain the AAP stance. Let us break it down.

The BJP was going to be on the upswing. AAP and its politics were meant to be an alternative to Congress. Instead of attacking Congress and becoming a natural competitor to BJP, it...attacks the BJP?

The second reason why it is fail - Any party which is facing a party with huge anti incumbency would go for the party with anti incumbency, why would it go after a party with no baggage going into the elections?

The third reason why this is fail - You are speaking with the benefit of hindsight. NOBODY (maybe Chankya did) predicted this kind of a mandate for BJP. AAP itself (in the form of hon Yoggie Salim Yadav) was predicting a hung assembly. The BJP was expected to get 200-220 odd seats in the best case, with Congress expected to retain about 100-150 odd seats. Going into polls, noway AK and co predicted this kind of a mandate. Political logic dictates that AAP could have fought the Congress and gone after these 100 odd seats.

The last reason why it is fail (your logic that is) - In Delhi, everybody expected the Congress to wipe out and BJP to form the govt, yet AAP went after Congress. Why these double standards, or rather how do you explain your logic here?

Only a 12 year old will believe that in Delhi, AAP went after the Congress and positioned itself as an alternative to the Congress, but 3 months later forgot about the Congress.

All this aside, it still begs the question, why not ONE tweet against Sonia or Raul Gandhi? Too much to ask?

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter__ case is an ongoing criminal case in the [Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat) state of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), after the state police killed underworld criminal __Sohrabuddin Anwarhussain Sheikh__ on November 26, 2005, while he was in police custody.

&gt;According to the police, apart from being involved in the criminal [extortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion) racket in Gujarat, Sheikh was also involved in arms smuggling in [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh), and also had murder cases registered against him in Gujarat and [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan).  Sheikh was also said to be associated with the banned global terrorist organization [Lashkar-e-Taiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Taiba) and the [Pakistani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan) intelligence agency [Inter-Services Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence), and planned to create communal chaos in the state by assassinating ""an important political leader"".   Although the target of Sheikh's plans has never been officially revealed, it is widely believed to have been Gujarat chief minister [Narendra Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi) himself, who is deeply unpopular among the Pakistani establishment and various [Islamic terrorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism) organizations in [South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia) after the [2002 Gujarat violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_violence). Sheikh's wife Kauser Bi also disappeared on the same day as his killing. A year later, on December 26, 2006, Sheikh's underworld associate [Tulsiram Prajapati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsiram_Prajapati), a witness to Sheikh's killing, was also killed in another police encounter shooting. 

&gt;Sheikh was allegedly [extorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion) protection money from local marble factories in Gujarat and Rajasthan.  He also had links to fellow underworld criminals Sharifkhan Pathan, Abdul Latif, Rasool Parti and Brajesh Singh, who were all members and associates of India's largest organized crime network and underworld mafia operated by [Dawood Ibrahim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawood_Ibrahim).    During investigations before he was arrested, the Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) of the Gujarat police had found 40 [AK-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47) assault rifles from his village residence in Madhya Pradesh.

Part1:


Read my article ""The Vindication of Amit Shah""
CBI Special Court at Mumbai has discharged Amit Shah, the BJP President, of all charges relating to a case of his involvement in the alleged killing of Soharabuddin and Tulsi Prajapati. I have been following this case actively from the time of its investigation, filing of charges, arrest of Amit Shah and grant of bail to him. I had written a letter on 27th September 2013 to the then Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, in my capacity as Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha. The letter pertains to misuse of CBI against BJP leadership. In the letter, I had written with regard to these two cases as under:
“Sohrabudin Encounter case
The encounter in which one Sohrabudin Sheikh was killed was an operation allegedly directed by the Intelligence Bureau of the Central Government. It has been a practice that when the Intelligence Bureau processes and develops intelligence, it keeps vigilance on the target. Thereafter when an opportunity arises to arrest the target the State police is associated with the operation. Sohrabudin was a noted mafia who operated in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and was carrying prize on his head in Madhya Pradesh. He was an illegal weapon dealer. He had also been convicted under TADA. The search conducted by Madhya Pradesh police at his premises at village Jharnia, District Ujjain had yielded more than 40 AK-56 rifles, hundreds of AK-56 cartridges and hundreds of hand grenades. He was an absconder from the police agencies of various state governments.
After his encounter on 24/25-11-2005 his brother filed a Writ Petition in the Supreme Court. The filing of the said petition was also sponsored by Congress Party. The then Addl. Solicitor General of India, Shri Gopal Subramaniam in a pre-conceived and planned move, appeared on day one before the Court and agreed to take instructions from the Central Government. Subsequently, the Attorney General appeared for the Union of India and Gopal Subramaniam designated himself as Amicus Curiae without any specific order of the court appointing him. The Government of India conceded that the investigations be handed over to the CBI. Though the Central Government should be a mere formal party, the then Attorney General used to appear and oppose even motion for adjournments. Since objections were raised with regard to the fairness of the CBI, the Supreme Court ordered investigations by a team of Gujarat Police officers of the State Police under its supervision. The State police reconstructed the encounter, conducted scientific investigation under supervision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and implicated and arrested several police officers including three IPS officers. Upon hearing the arguments of the Union of India and Shri Gopal Subramaniam, the amicus curiae and others, the Supreme Court referred the matter to the CBI. The ground on which the Supreme Court transferred the case to the CBI was that the investigation involved inter-state ramifications and the Andhra Pradesh angle of the matter had not been probed. As a matter of fact the Congress Government in Andhra Pradesh did not cooperate in the investigation by Gujarat police which is a matter of record.
The CBI investigated the case but did not investigate any of the four points, on the basis of which the case was referred to the CBI, which were the points found lacking in Gujarat police investigation. It did not probe the Andhra Pradesh angle of the case seriously. The probable purpose of the CBI in this case was to try and implicate the political establishment of Gujarat, setting aside the pretence of federal character of India’s governance. The CBI targeted Shri Amit Shah, the then Home Minister and also the Minister of Law, Transport &amp; Parliamentary Affairs of the State of Gujarat with the ultimate desire of implicating Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
Shockingly, when the Legal department of the CBI opined that there was no case against Shri Amit Shah, the same was responded to by the Supervisory Officer of CBI, putting up a “Note” by observing that the arrest of Amit Shah would enable the CBI to get some more witnesses particularly the police officers since they would then feel intimidated. He also opined that arresting Amit Shah was necessary since it was necessary to reach the eventual target of investigation of Narendra Modi. This note was approved by the Director, CBI, Shri Ashwani Kumar.
The CBI arrested Amit Shah with no prosecutable evidence against him. In order to arrest Amit Shah they relied on the false testimony of two witnesses namely, Ramanbhai Patel and Dashrathbhai Patel, noted land grabbers of Gujarat. Shri Amit Shah, as per the CBI theory in the Charge Sheet, is alleged to have told both of them six months after the encounter that Sohrabudin had left no option for himself. This was incorporated as an extra judicial confession It is noteworthy that both Ramanbhai Patel and Dashrathbhai Patel have criminal antecedents and criminal cases in Gujarat. These two witnesses were felicitated for having given such a deposition against Shri Amit Shah in a function presided over by Shri Shankersinh Waghela, the then President of Gujarat Congress. The testimony of these two witnesses is based upon the alleged extortion from them to help them in PASA detention. The record of the Gujarat Government shows that no detention of these persons under PASA was never in contemplation. Said two witnesses also claimed that they have paid a sum of Rs. 75 lacs to Shri Amit Shah through one Ajay Patel in three different installments with specific dates mentioned by them in their statement. They gave the specific dates of payments on which they allegedly physically handed over the alleged amount to Shri Ajay Patel. They further claimed that they were there through all the dates. This testimony is false without any further probe inter alia on the ground that on some of the dates Ajay Patel was not even in India and his passport establishes this fact. This was a key substance of a frivolous charge sheet filed against Shri Amit Shah. Shri Amit Shah was granted bail on this charge sheet by the Gujarat High Court by a detailed speaking order inter alia holding that there is no prima facie case against Shri Amit Shah. The CBI, however, challenged the said order and upon the request of the CBI, the Supreme Court ordered Shri Amit Shah to remain out of Gujarat and all political activities. He remained outside the State of Gujarat for a period of two years. The said order of the High Court was upheld by the Supreme Court.

130,"Part 2:

Tulsi Prajapati encounter


Tulsi Prajapati was a case built up by the CBI as an extension to the Sohrabudin case. The CBI solicited the investigation of this case by making a specific prayer in the Court. Their ostensible case was that Tulsi Prajapati was a witness to the arrest and disappearance of Sohrabudin while in custody of the police officers and correspondingly he was eliminated by the Gujarat Police. The only evidence mentioned against Shri Amit Shah by the CBI in this case was that he was regularly in touch with one police officer Shri R.K. Pandian, IPS who was an accused in the case. The vast contemporaneous record shows that Shri R.K.Pandian, IPS had been regularly in telephonic contact of Shri Amit Shah much before and after the incident as a part of his official duty since he was also heading the charge of SP, IB (Intelligence) of the State Police looking after political agitations and political activities. Any Home Minister of any State will have to necessarily remain in touch with SP, IB (Intelligence) of the State Police looking after political agitations and political activities since he had to keep himself informed about the activities on a regular basis. Without a point of evidence a separate Charge Sheet was filed against Shri Amit Shah in the Tulsi Prajapati case. Very importantly, though the CBI was under the direction of the Supreme Court to complete the investigation of Tulsi Prajapati case within 6 months from 11-04-2011, the CBI deliberately and as a part of political conspiracy did not obey the direction and filed the Charge Sheet on 04-09-2012 so as to arrest Shri Amit Shah once again just few months before the Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections which were scheduled to be held before December, 2012. Shri Amit Shah had to approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Supreme Court vide its order date 08-04-2013 held that no separate charge sheet could be filed in this case since CBI itself had alleged that both the cases were similar and it merged the charge sheet with the Sohrabudin case charge sheet thereby preventing the CBI arresting Shri Amit Shah once again.
Tulsi Prajapati and the arrest of Shri Gulab Chand Kataria, former Home Minister Rajasthan
Shri Gulab Chand Kataria is the former Home Minister of Rajasthan and the present Leader of Opposition in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly and a very important leader of Rajasthan BJP. He is a complete stranger to even the existence of such persons known as Sohrabudin and Tulsi Prajapati. The CBI filed a supplementary charge sheet against Gulab Kataria wherein it was alleged that the motive of elimination of Tulsi Prajapati by Gulab Kataria was extorting money from marble dealers of Rajasthan namely RK Marbles. As per the CBI there were two motives; one the Gujarat Police wanted to eliminate him in order to eliminate the eye-witness in the Sohrabdun case and the Home Minister of Rajasthan wanted to eliminate him for extorting money from marble dealers. What a co-incidence. It was alleged by the CBI that Shri Gulab Chand Kataria allegedly met one Shri D. G Vanjara, IPS of Gujarat Police allegedly between 26/12/2005 and 28/12/2005 at the Circuit House at Udaipur. The CBI evidence of his presence was that PS of Shri Gulab Chand Kataria was staying in the same Circuit House during that period and Shri D.G.Vanzara, IPS also stayed in the said Circuit House. However, records of the Rajasthan Government conclusively establish that Shri Gulab Chand Kataria along with his wife had flown on 25/12/2005 to Mumbai and stayed there till 2/1/2006. He attended the meeting of the BJP National Executive and thereafter a meeting of the National Council and after celebrating New Year along with his wife, returned to Jaipur on 2/1/2006.”
It is clear from the above that the charges were filed against Amit Shah at the behest of the then political Government. There was legally no admissible evidence against him. Amit Shah’s application for discharge was opposed both by the CBI and Sohrabuddin’s brother. The court heard both their lawyers’. The charge was without any basis. The fact that the CBI allowed itself to be misused is a cause for concern. 
Since I had analysed the alleged evidence, both during investigation and after the filing of the charge sheet, I was amongst the few voices which had consistently maintained in the past three years that the prosecution of Amit Shah was a case of “No Evidence”. Without analysing the evidence in detail, the media allowed itself to report as was briefed by CBI. Even a vital noting on the CBI file that the implication of Amit Shah was necessary so that the then Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Narendra Modi could be implicated, was no news for them. I am relieved at the fact that we have an independent judicial system in India which has vindicated Amit Shah.",2014-12-31 12:36:01

It works like this with many right-wing parties all over the world. To further complicate matters people like Modi, Advani, Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and Vajpayee were lifelong RSS workers.

Within few months, the religious bigots within the party came out openly. There was an atmosphere of intolerance. Deepa Mehta was not allowed film the movie Earth. Murli Manohar Joshi allowed teaching of Astrology courses in universities. Fringe elements of the VHP like Praveen Togadia got large mindshare in politics. Then came the riots in 2002 where they butchered thousands of Muslims. Modi made Maya Kodnani (who was later convicted of butchering people) a minister in his government.  The industry loved them because they allowed easy land acquisitions at cheap rates and disinvested various public sector undertakings. But as a person who hoped for a liberal, progressive government, I was deeply disappointed. I will never vote for the BJP again unless they show evidence of moving to a socially liberal party.

&gt;All I know about India's political atmosphere is that Modi murdered a bunch of Muslims, including pregnant women, in Gujarat a while back, according to the US government and UN. 

If you do not know, then you can learn now.

Hindutva can be described as a nationalist movement for the advancement of the Hindu nation and the indigenous culture. Hindu as defined in Hindutva generally means Indian (the original definition of the word). Similar to all ideologies, this means different things to different people. There are some people who are extreme but they don't define the movement.

Hindutva is philosophy and not an organization and is therefore not comparable to the KKK. The primary originator of the Hindutva is the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, National Self-Service Organization). For all the fear mongering people like you engage in, this is not the first Hindutva government in India. Just because there is a Hindutva party in power does not mean India will change radically and start prosecuting religious minorities. At worst, the damage that will limited to egos.

Viz a vis Modi, he was not an African warlord and did not have any direct involvement in the riots of 2002. As riots go, that part of India has always been a tinderbox with many major riots since 1947. Since 2002, there has been no major communal incident in that state. It is one of  the few riots where of the 1000 people killed, 30% were mobs shot dead by the police. As regards to why it is blown out of proportion. 2002 was the first riot after the advent of satellite channels. Therefore, it is stored in the collective memory. Also as a consequence of the riots, large number of people were displaced making the casualties appear disproportionate. The biggest reason may also be that during the 2003 elections which followed, he refused to be apologetic and defiant. He said hang me if you I am guilty but I did no wrong. He also made the attacks on his governments into attacks against Gujarat and its people. (In hindsight, a bold strategy that made him win in a landslide). This offended the sensibilities of the media (mostly at the time run by ex-bueracrats from the previous congress regimes).

Modi was a first time CM who was sworn in 3 months earlier among political bickering. He did not yet consolidate his power fully. Also, when he asked the neighboring states (ruled by the opposition Congress) for additional police personnel (because the police machinery broke down along communal lines), he was unable to get it. Typically the Indian Army is called in to deal with these situations and they do a fantastic job. However, in this case Operation Parakram was going on and the Army was deployed along the border. 

For 12 years, the Congress party (his opponents) tried to dig up proof of his involvement and failed. He was also exonerated by a Special Investigation Team set up by the Supreme Court of India. In this time, he has delivered development to Gujarat, calmed tempers, and has all around been pretty good as a Chief Minister. If he is a bigoted fascist, he is an incompetent one as Muslims are best of in his state according to the Sachar Committee report which was promulgated to look into the status of Muslims across the country by the Congress. He rejects the notion of pandering to muslims, a hallmark of Indian political hypocrisy. He is a politician but when even 35% of muslims in his state vote for him, you may have to take a closer look at why your views are so radical.

This may be a a write up that is sympathetic to him but there are multiple views by people with vested interests. The view you came off with was built to get the muslim votebank to vote for the Congress. The truth may lie somewhere in the middle but many of us are sufficiently convinced of his innocence and with good reason. After the change of guard, now many of his former detractors to seem to be conceding ground on their claims so they are not exactly reliable. The biggest anti-Modi campaigner wrt 2002, Teesta Setalvad for example lives by skimming money raised for the victims. 

Oh with respect to the US ban, it was also done for political interests. It was done to make it seem like a law passed to protect Christians in China was actually secular. They though modi was a non-entity and banned him. He became the PM and it became an embarassment.

240,"&gt;Is it comparable to Nazism or any other extreme nationalist movement then?

Every movement is unique and so there can not be a direct comparison. You need to realize that India is an experiment like no other. It is more similar to the EU than any country. It has many similarities with a lot of philosophies and can be anything since there is no defined objectives and is quite hazy. I would say though that it is firmly a reactionary movement. You can go through the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva) and reach your conclusions. 

&gt; I am aware of this, but the UN and US still hold that he is guilty.

It is ironic that a state which was largely publicly legitimized and justified by the holocaust of Jews (and many others peoples) at the hands of the Nazis, has inflicted very similar treatment on the Palestinians since its creation. I don't condone any of the violent terrorism that Hamas is behind. They are just as bad as the fascist Israelis. But the ordinary Palestinian is also worth less than cattle in the Israeli government's eyes. Israel keeps talking over and over about how Hamas wants to eradicate all Jews, while simultaneously bulldozing Palestinian houses and growing their Jewish-only settlements. So who really wants a genocide? Israel operates with complete international immunity because they have the US's nuts in a jar on their bedside table. It is just ridiculous to see how brazenly they slaughter people and neigbourhoods over and over again, based on some flimsy unvalidated pretense. 

So I'm really sorry to hear that you love and want to emulate Israel. If you feel so despite having objectively looked at the history of what has happened in the past 70 years in that region, I would have to conclude that you are pretty heartless. 

In any case comparing the Indo-Pak geopolitics and issues with that of Israel-Palestine is a horrible analogy. The history is different, and the problems and their solutions are different. I do think that a hard stand needs to be taken by India, and I am very satisfied with how the current administration has been handling it so far. But if India ever turns to the tactics and rhetoric that Israel uses, it would be a shameful page in our history. I for one hope that will never happen.

Indian MSM is not one identity - stop with the us versus them posts and attitude. Typical siege mentality.

Reddit admis don't ban for fun. /r/India mods might have an agenda but reddit admins don't. It shows the typical victim complex and deep insecurities you carry.

Some people do think that the khakhi chaddi fake upholders of Hinduism are a threat to the society which also include Hindus. However, there are regular routine posts about Islam and Christanity hidden agenda. The moment you'd remove your RSS jaundiced shakha glasses you'd see the difference and shed the victim mentality.

I am not sure about these rules of income tax but this was the premise of your argument - Amount is less than 20,000 then donor's details does not have to be revealed and the money is not taxable. Your inference then is that AAP is avoiding taxes **and** taking black money.

It could simply be that AAP is asking for donors to donate money in amounts less than 20,000 so as to avoid taxation.  Every organisation tries to reduce its taxes paid. It is also possible than donors don't want to reveal all their details(address, PAN etc.) and still donate the maximum amount possible. 

Is AAP trying to reduce is taxes? Very very likely(not the case when donors don't want their details revealed). Is AAP taking black money? Can't be sure and this picture and your argument are not proof of their corruption.

P.S : Not an AAP supporter but a Modi bhakt from Gujarat. That shouldn't matter in an argument though.

That leaves only one reason for AAP to be legally doing this(breaking money into 20K chunks) - the donors don't want their details revealed. However, donors get tax exemptions for claiming donations for political parties. So unless these donors really value their privacy no reason for them to not claim donations to AAP and not give their full details. TL;DR - This is most likely black money.

**Step 1** Make funds public 

**Step 2** Audit them independently

The point I was trying to make is that Step 1 is what the parties can/should do. Step 2 should be done by independent agencies not the parties. In case of BJP and other parties, they are not doing Step 1 itself. Step 1 is something which is under the control of ALL parties. Moreover Step 1, is a pre-requisite for Step 2. AAP has taken the step, the other parties are in fact creating further hinderances.

In case of Step 2, it is the BJP that can bring a legislation due to being the largest mandate for 100% electoral funding.

&gt; I don't see how AAP is as good as they're pretending to be.

AAP has taken the first step and the other verification etc. is beyond their control. In fact, they do conduct audits themselves but that won't satiate you. So bring in the legislation? You can't call out AAP, when the BJP itself can't bring in the legislation for those audits.

&gt; The online thing is an unverified record kept by AAP and if you look into it, you'll find names such as muffler man or Narendra Modi donating thousands of rupees.

But, there is a money trail! You can follow the money trail and land up somewhere. In order to fix that problem, we require a legislation. AAP is indeed better because it is doing all that is possible given its limitations.

328,"What do you think Modi was trying to prove by making that statement? If he was trying to say that plastic surgery has its origins in India, then its true, isn't it? Some forms of reconstructive surgery did originate from India. Ganesh getting the elephant head is a story and just leave it at that. Its possible that the person who came up with this story did so after plastic surgery was being performed in India and plastic surgery was in his mind too when he came up with the story. What I am saying is that its just a story and its best to leave it at that. ",2015-01-03 23:37:38
329,"&gt;**""We want our scientists to explore the mysteries of science and not of government procedure,""** Modi said, while inaugurating the 102nd Indian Science Congress in Mumbai.
""Our institutions of research must become more broad based. Our universities must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy,"" Modi said.
**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.

We'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...

On the administrative policy aspect

&gt; ""As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,"" Modi said.

and

&gt;**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**

(Awesome!)

and

&gt;""We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,"" he added.

... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)

Moving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says

&gt;Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, ""Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.""

&amp;
 
&gt;""You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,"" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated ""as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas"".
""We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,"" the Prime Minister said.

A re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.

Modi on the legislative policy aspect.

&gt;He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.

There are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?

The PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects

&gt;A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.

&amp;

&gt;The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.

&amp;

&gt; **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**

(Are you listening, industry?)

&gt;China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.

The usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&amp;D? As in IP generating R&amp;D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.

Anyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&amp;T policy, as well as offer his two cents.

&gt;Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.
He said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.
The PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.

But would it really matter if a thing was in manifesto or they said it verbally? In today's age, it's pretty easy for people to see if they are diverting from either. People wouldn't care if it was in the manifesto or the speech. And even the government knows that.

&gt;e.g.: now they say they only promised to initiate procedures to bring back black money within the first 100 days. 

But that's what they said in the speech.

Given that Iran is pretty isolated right now and with the Nuclear-deal with US not going anywhere, anytime soon, they need all the trade partners they can get. Also, the rest of the Arab world might not like if India is cozying up with Israel. The flip side is that Israel is a strong ally and source of a lot of our military hardware. They also have a common interest in matters like counter-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation. It is only natural that we would want to lean towards their side, rather than towards Palestine, practically speaking, at this point is just a glorified resistance movement, one that is increasingly being hijacked by extremist elements and funded by shady sources.

With Afghanistan, it gets more complicated. We have to fight for influence and clout with 2 neighbours what we don't really share a great working relationship with, to say the least. From their point of view, favouring China is the natural choice (since they can keep Pak on a leash and dole out more generous economic packages).


Agree with the idea that Israel being a Pandora's box for the US, for India though, the only drawback w.r.t closer ties with Israel is the backlash from the Palestine-sympathizers, both inside the country and outside. Disagree on the observation that Israel's nuclear ambiguity drove Iran towards the bomb, the ""active"" proliferation by elements of the AQ Khan scandal seems to point towards this (the indirect funding of Khan's quest for the bomb by multiple countries in the Arab world and the supposed promise from Pakistan that the bomb tech would be ""shared"" with the Arab world).

Study? Which study?

Sorry but this may or may not be true. For example, certain PIB employees work even on all days and sometimes late up to midnight - this has always been the case because the government makes press releases throughout the day.

&gt;  The dashboard on January 3, which was a Saturday and an off day for Government employees, showed that 31.6 per cent of the staff showed up before the office start time of 9am while, 38.8 per cent of the registered employees marked their presence between 9 and 10am. 

Percentage can be highly misleading on a holiday. Also, the reasons for showing up early could be various including a night shift, a early morning PWD call etc.

&gt; ""Kejriwal's biometric scheme ups employee attendance by 20 minutes a day""
&gt; When Kejriwal HBUH started anti-corruption helpline in Delhi, everyone was jumping through hoops. Yet the initiative had been going on for years in many other states. But AAPians presented it as if Kejriwal was the only one doing that. The fct that it bombed within days is another matter.

Tu Quoque? Your response is that because AAP did it, BJP does so too. Nice! What has Kejriwal got to do with this? It looks like Kejriwal has done some serious mental disintegration on the BJP fanboys.

&gt; Now that you have a website which shows all the details related to attendance among other sources, you have to complain because credit goes to BJP.

I actually gave credit to Modi for putting in the policy.  I can understand how criticism is quite unnerving for ""nationalists"" and therefore, they can tend to ignore words and pick on the ones where they can fight online battles.

&gt; Not a single point of yours is worth responding, specially this. Typing just for the sake of it.

The hypocrisy just overflows. Talks about  constructive criticism and indulges in tangential comments related to Kejriwal on a thread about biometric attendance. Then further goes on to label names just because a critique (not criticism) was written against the article (not Modi).

&gt; **too much** of a socialistic ideology. An ideology that has failed horribly and has no place in today's world

The second statement makes it seem that I want 0 socialism. That is my wording at fault. What I believe in is minimum socialism and maximum capitalism - market socialism if you will. Or as Modi would say - minimum governance. From the way AAP talks, I think they favour socialism more than capitalism. If I am right and AAP comes to power Delhi will experience short term gains but nothing in the long term. 

I am a big fan of capitalism. Most of the developed countries have capitalism. South Korea was worse off than us in 1950 but look where capitalism has brought it today. Not saying that capitalism would have worked 100% for India but from what has been seen since the liberization era, capitalism has worked well for our country and could have worked well if adopted in 1950. Did we have the necessary resources for capitalism at that time? Perhaps not so cant really blame Nehru and co. 

Communistic regimes like China and Russia have succeeded due to authoritarian governments. Overall in my opinion, democratic socialism is bound to fail because once you start giving out stuff for free you need to have enough power to control the people when that free supply stops - or in other words, an authoritarian government. Democratic socialism(AAP's ideology) has no place in a country like India except for a few sectors like education, health etc.

Regarding border skirmishes what exactly is it that so great that this Modi sarkar has done? 

Other than PR and media spin, of course.

2014 July to present (around 6 months):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014–15_India–Pakistan_border_skirmishes

Indian casualties: 7 soldiers 14 civilians : total 21

Pakistani casualties: 6 soldiers (8 claimed) 21 civilians : total 27 (29 claimed)

2013 Jan to Oct (around 9 months):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_India–Pakistan_border_skirmishes

Indian casualities: 12 soldiers 1 civilian : total 13

Pakistani casualities: 10 soldiers (9 claimed) 14 civilians (6 claimed) : total 24 (15 claimed)

So what exactly is the difference here? Were Indian soldiers not retaliating before? Is my data wrong?

Or is it as I suspected, Modi is just better at managing the media and his PR team is doing their job well?

Because in 2013 under MMS, more Pakistanis were killed by India than vice versa and now also the status is the same. Infact if we go by the data claimed by the Indian govt. it is 21:29 in 2013 and 13:15 under Modi.

Could someone please point out where I am wrong and why we all should be thanking Modiji for empowering our soldiers? Or am I right in assuming that Indian soldiers were retaliating just as much under MMS, and this is all just PR and media propaganda by Modi/BJP, something which I have to admit they are very good at?

Thanks.

The monetary policy and the budget was relatively consistent between the two governments last year. Let's also not ignore the effect of the oil price drop.

&gt; A GST bill is being worked out with co operation of states that would simplify the tax regime.

The same BJP states which opposed it are suddenly more co-operative with their objections (including Modi's) all withdrawn in the face of 'consultation'. The same states were unwilling to even negotiate on a compromise last year or have a discussion on it. Modi claimed that technology was a big stumbling block preventing its implementation but there is no mention now of the vast improvements to technology that they have introduced to resolve it.

&gt; NITI Aayog with a federal structure is a think tank established under the free market economist Arvind Panagaria.

Montek Singh Ahluwalia was hardly a Socialist who believed in a planned economy - the Planning Commission has hardly indulged in Soviet Style national planning since the economic reforms  were introduced. The earlier commission also did a lot of program and funds monitoring but the new one will be mainly policy focused. The new one is certainly different but the previous one was a lot closer to this one than it was to a socialist planning organization.

&gt;Japan, China, US are investing hundreds of crores in FDI.

They have always invested when the economy was good - Modi has signed a lot of agreements but they are yet to materialize and the investment from them hasn't started flooding in as yet.

&gt; Fuel has been deregulated.

It path towards de-regulation had already begun in the previous government- this one brought it to it's logical conclusion.

The problems with the previous government were mainly corruption, the fact that it was a coalition and then a minority government (no political standing), and period of fiscal mismanagement towards the middle of their second stint. India did grow from the 10th to the 3rd largest economy under them but slipped up on a lot of measures towards the end. 

Credit should be given where it was due but it's too early to judge the results from the policies announced since most are yet to take affect.

440,"&gt;It depends on the government. If a government wants it can clamp on communal tension within hours

That's an extremely simplistic view.

If the government identifies that a conspiracy is being hatched to commit riots, or if it gets adequate intelligence on time, it can squash a riot before it is set in motion or immediately after by arresting the conspirators and clamping down on the area in question (locality or slightly larger part of city). That requires timely intelligence, and the ability to deploy in the area in question **in force** (to borrow from COIN parlance, the police engage in area domination).

If the riot has already been set in motion and is spreading beyond a locality, the police no longer has the numbers to dominate all affected areas and squelch the riot. Then it becomes a question of mitigating / moderating the effects of the riot till reinforcements can be rushed in (which is what happened with Modi in 2002). Often reinforcements are merely a district away, and can be rushed in adequate numbers quickly. But sometimes they're in the next state, and those states refuse to send reinforcements because politics (which, again, is what happened with Modi in 2002), and the government has to ask for the Army to be deployed.

448,"&gt;I read that fin report. And take a look at the achievements - most of them - a large percent - are from being able to remove environmental protections.

TBH, they are working with existing guidelines. What the UPA did though was criminal, aside from Jairam Ramesh who was a good minister, family loyalists like Jayanthi Natrajan sat on files forever for no good reason. This is what I call better execution on the executive side.

I have a contrarian view on environmental norms though - historically countries have made the leap into the developed economy status on the back of manufacturing (including China), and this is bound to cause some medium term pollution. However richer states (the US is an exception) pollute less as they tend to move onto a services based model and have stricter environmental norms.

Without this switch, India will continue to have 100's of millions living in sub Saharan conditions.

&gt;Economics will also favor us because of the shift in the global market

The UPA rode a boom in its first term, but it did nothing to drive growth in manufacturing or agriculture. The entire growth in the UPA era was driven by services (mostly IT / ItES / Banking) and this is just not sustainable. Also with the growth of near shoring and onshoring, I think we may have missed the bus on manufacturing outsourcing. The one which benefited China, Vietnam and others so much. Hope Modi and his regime are able to attract a fair bit of investment into manufacturing despite this.

The BJP and Modi stance on GST is fairly well documented. Like I said before, they wanted consultation, they wanted petroleum (and states like TN wanted alcohol) off the central revenue stream. The UPA was just not willing to listen. Aside from the Congress ruled states today, I don't think any state was against the GST per se. Asking for clarification is not the same as rejecting it.

Labour reforms are a big ticket item which would need a fuckton of political capital. I think the NDA won't touch this till Winter 2015 at the earliest.

Just copy/pasting as is. Just for laughs.

This I read on Twitter. Cannot verify the authenticity of these tweets.

LutyensInsider: Congress is working on a grand plan that will hugely embarrass Modi government. Media, and some old loyalists still in govt, a part of it.

LutyensInsider: The plan is to invent an Indian “Edward Snowden”, who will claim that the Modi govt is working on a plan for nuclear war with Pak.

LutyensInsider: Not only a nuclear war with Pakistan, this “Snowden” will claim much bigger things. Such as a plan for genocide of Muslims and Christians.

LutyensInsider: The plan is to create so much international pressure that the Modi govt is unable to focus on domestic issues and implementation of plans.

LutyensInsider: The blueprint of the plan is all ready, but they are finding it difficult to get a fake “Snowden” out in open. Too risky.

LutyensInsider: The goal of the plan is to create unrest in India, and securing a mid-term poll, where they believe that BJP will fail to get majority.

LutyensInsider: The goal of the plan is to create unrest in India, and securing a mid-term poll, where they believe that BJP will fail to get majority.

LutyensInsider: The media reports questioning official version of the Pakistani boat fire could be the test-run of this plot. To check response.

LutyensInsider: Once they are sure that reports painting govt as liar and attacker are getting popular, this fake “Snowden” will be presented to the worl",2015-01-05 21:39:46

No other country in the world was screwed over as much as India because of Western colonialism and now Modi is rubber stamping the exploitation of the Palestinian people just 67 years after India gained their independence from Western hegemony. 

Modi is turning India into a puppet state for the West. India has sovereignty, so they should act like it. Indians would do well to remind themselves that the kind of rationale they're applying to make excuses for Israel is the same kind of reasoning that allowed Britons to ease their conscience about the rape and pillage of India during British colonization.

I don't think you know what you are talking about. [Here's the link to the Wikipedia page detailing India-Palestine relations.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Palestine_relations)

India was once a shining beacon for shaming the rampant colonialism taking place in Palestine and the occupied territories. Modi is ruining that great legacy of humanitarianism. He's turning India into a vassal state of the West, rubber stamping their colonialism at the UN. India might as well just turn over its UN vote to England, with Modi in charge. England and America are calling the shots for Modi, he is their puppet. ",2015-01-05 23:02:21

India was once a great example of a burgeoning power that cared about humanitarianism. Now under Modi, we just do what America and England tell us to do, and turn our back on other people that are being colonized my Europeans. This change in policy is rife with hypocrisy. ",2015-01-05 23:25:00

490,"Exactly what is the difference between Congress and the BJP?

Regarding border skirmishes what exactly is it that is so great that this Modi sarkar has done? 

Other than PR and media spin, of course.

2014 July to present (around 6 months):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014–15_India–Pakistan_border_skirmishes

Indian casualties: 7 soldiers 14 civilians : total 21

Pakistani casualties: 6 soldiers (8 claimed) 21 civilians : total 27 (29 claimed)

2013 Jan to Oct (around 9 months):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_India–Pakistan_border_skirmishes

Indian casualities: 12 soldiers 1 civilian : total 13

Pakistani casualities: 10 soldiers (9 claimed) 14 civilians (6 claimed) : total 24 (15 claimed)

So what exactly is the difference here? Were Indian soldiers not retaliating before? Is my data wrong?

Or is it as I suspected, Modi is just better at managing the media and his PR team is doing their job well?

Because in 2013 under MMS, more Pakistanis were killed by India than vice versa and now also the status is the same. Infact if we go by the data claimed by the Indian govt. it is 21:29 in 2013 and 13:15 under Modi.

Could someone please point out where I am wrong and why we all should be thanking Modiji for empowering our soldiers? Or am I right in assuming that Indian soldiers were retaliating just as much under MMS, and this is all just PR and media propaganda by Modi/BJP, something which I have to admit they are very good at?

In fact if my understanding is correct, there were no skirmishes between Oct 13 and Jul 14, due to a ceasefire. Under MMS. Is that correct?

So more Indians have been killed by Pakistan in the first six months of Modi sarkar than in the last six months of MMS.",2015-01-05 23:47:34
491,"Modi has also done one other thing: Turned a huge group of otherwise sane, rational people into frothing at the mouth hate-crazed zombies whose every waking moment is dedicated to abusing him and anyone or anything remotely associated with him.

So great is their hatred that to bring about his downfall they will fall at the feet of Mamata, Mulayam, Mayawati, Lalu, Deve Gowda, Chautala, Sonia, Rahul, Digvijay, Khurshid and even Satan himself and be their lifelong apologists and groupies if that is what it takes.

During the elections I was always amused to see these types scrutinizing and attacking Modi's credentials and then asking us to vote for fucking Pappu, Mulayam, Mamata did etc. as PM candidates! Of course no scrutiny for these guys and there 1000x worse records.",2015-01-06 00:09:55

Actually it is neither necessary nor expected. Opposition should be on policy issues and not on a personal level.",2015-01-06 00:10:41
493,"&gt; Exactly what is the difference between Congress and the BJP?

Difference 1:  Congress was in power for past 10 years. BJP has been in power less than 10 months.

Difference 2: Congress Presidents for last 10 years have been the Gandhis ~ not the real Gandhis, the fake Gandhis.

Difference 3: Congress got routed in General Elections. BJP won.

Difference 4: Congress got routed ion all stateelections held after the General elections. BJP has won or surpassed congress in terms of seats.

Difference 5: BJP success makes you butthurt. Congress success you probably havent seen in quite a while.

&gt; Regarding border skirmishes what exactly is it that is so great that this Modi sarkar has done?

1. There is no claim made by the Govt of India that they have acheived a milestone regarding border skirmishes . Note that you ask what the Modi Sarkaar has done, so the claim should come from the Govt of India and not the BJP or the BJP fans.

From what I read in the updated ministry rules- they aren't following norms, they've simplified norms to dramatically reduce the requirements to execute projects. The classification for forests have been weakened, and the requirements for clearances have been eased. There's a project right next to a national park in mumbai which just got cleared because of these changes, for example.

So, for sure a lot of the early reforms are just making it easy to,access resources - husbandry giving way to utilization. Plus you forget, or haven't read the misery that is the NGO report. So it's very clear that the ground work, the political theatre, has been set up to allow people to get their pound of flesh. Again, thems just the breaks, but it's easier to,deal,with it without the PR spin.

One failure In modi's reforms, one which the upa 2 (or 1) of all people tried for was, retail fdi. I really expected that to work out but was surprised that it didn't. But that was also useful in understanding the political capital limits Modi was/is operating under. 

His simplification drive should be good, but at the same time I dislike when I read news through supporters. Most of them haven't read a bill or seen the safe guards and logic built into them. 

I don't know if we missed any bus on manufacturing, and I've been questioning that orthodoxy of late. I suspect manufacturing gave economic power to people. Today that's not the case.

I've seen GST for a while, and no one wants it just because they lose revenue. Hence the delayed roll out. But it's always been one of the ""inevitable"" projects which would come to fruition. Every one was horse trading. Instead I give MOdi early credit for what he *will use* GST to accomplish for the country.",2015-01-06 00:33:36
