And for the blue collar workers I'm suggesting that they should start early and leave early not that they should start late and end late. Basically start your shift when sun is out and go home before dark. It will have the same benefit of having a different time zone but without any confusion of different time zone.

And you've only mentioned charging commission from ONE person. In theory, in the future, they can charge a commission from both the sender and reciever of the digital payment - why screw one, when 2 birds are better in hand ( ... or something to that effect ... ;)

I also remember reading how Arun Jaitley had once suggested that we should abolish income tax and just charge a tax on all bank transfer / transactions.

13,"again, why are you looking at this from a political angle? I'm talking from the perspectives that involve economics, mathematics, reality and practicality. I'm not a stickler for either MUDI or PAPPU (nor KRAJI in case you assumed the worst). Is a flat rate of 30,000 viable while people are being paid less and less by day in this economy? what kind of math is involved? Have they considered if these new old people actually took care of their old people or did they abandon their parents to have a future with their own families just like their children did to them? If an old person requires 30,000 pm to be looked after, shouldn't an entire family be entitled to at least equal to that amount to survive then? or.. If the problem is sending parents to old age home, can India come up with a basic income system so that employed children can take substantial breaks from their work in order to look after their parents (because companies sure as shit wouldn't give a fuck about how sick your mum is)? Because you know not all old people are healthy as horses and may require constant looking after.

First of all, the whole notion of children have to look after their parents is a falsetto set by most Indians, ""ooh, they looked after you for so long"", well you had to do that because you didn't want to use a condom. Having children with expectation of something from them in future is a very wrong reason to have children in the first place. If you planned your offspring, you should be prepared to accept all kinds of consequences including getting abandoned when they grow wings of their own. There is no other reason than passing on your genes.

In case they stayed with you till the end, Lucky you! Bully for you. If not, Alas! welcome to club ""most of us"".

I'd rather earn a lot of money and set my self a cozy old age home, than to cross my fingers hoping that my children and their better halves might take care of me.

**Oh BTW! I'm not twisting anything, what the government has come up with is inherently a bad decision! They are pandering for seniors' votes just like every other politician in every other country! Because, Seniors are the most probable to vote in elections. That is basic politics. Again, this is NOT A GOOD THING. Any other party would've done the same**

PS: It is a very common sense in politics to have seniors vote for you. I'm not criticizing Modi for doing what politicians have to do, that's his job. What i'm criticizing though is the decision. It is bad because India isn't some first world country where this strategy is viable, and this looks like rather a flashy advertisement for election season than anything concrete.",2017-06-15 08:06:38

The last thing I'll do is become a cheerleader for a political party. Mostly because a lot of cheerleading involves ignoring facts. So, obviously you don't care when it is pointed out that 60 million people opted for zero balance accounts just before Modi took power or the fact that Modi was not the architect of the concept itself. 

Finally, if you have enough grey matter to think beyond the idea and worry about its implemention then you'll realize that pushing Aadhar through such social schemes was a great mischief of UPA govt and your 56"" has not done anything to rectify it.

17,"I believe those with vested intrested sold it to Mr. Modi like that - that he would recover all black money. It would have been easy to sell it to him because one of the tales popular around the RSS camps is how Janata Party PM destroyed black money by demonetisation (even though the facts don't bear that, but then when has facts been the RSS strong points?). I believe the real reason has always been the ""cashless economy"" one. (I started another discussion here on that - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6hbsw2/india_digital_payments_a_500_billion_dollar_pot/ ). 

There's also the rumour that Modi thought that he could put his own photo on all the new notes.

20,"&gt; From Modi’s critique in Parliament that the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) was a “living monument to UPA’s failure” to the biggest-ever allocation of Rs 48,000 crore in the Budget, the NDA government has travelled a long way on the path of rural employment 

I like how the author spins it. Modi came into power thrashing NREGA, along with most of his well-off supporters at the time on this sub. I remember lurking here and anyone defending NREGA was branded a Congress welfarist. 

Of course, now that job creation has plunged, Modi et al have found it impossible to provide the masses with sufficient jobs, so they boost NREGA to record levels. 

This isn't an 'achievement'. People go to NREGA because they have no other option. That's why it is there. It means there is little to no serious job creation. It also highlights the hypocrisy as the loudest fans of Modi have fallen eerily silent as Modi embraces that which he once attacked. It of course undermines the notion of Modi 'the reformer'.",2017-06-15 10:05:44

Whether not removing Modi then was a mistake or not is debatable.

Yamuna riverfront development: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has finalized its plan to develop the Yamuna riverfront, which currently is in an atrocious condition. It has been learned that DDA wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi to unveil the project, according to Navbharat Times report. As soon as the authority gets the Prime Minister’s Office nod in this regard, they will start the project, the report says. The first phase of the work will be undertaken in the stretch between Lohe-ka-Pul or the iron bridge to the ITO barrage. DDA will also build a biodiversity park. Apart from this, a 2.5-km long walkway will be constructed for people to spend leisure time. The walkway will be constructed in such a way that people get the feeling of a hill station. This will be achieved by creating hill-type terrain. Lakes too will be created, the report says.

Officials said that beautification of Yamuna riverfront will be done through eco-friendly methods. Wood will be used to construct the walkway. The use of cement will be limited. The aim of the project is to connect people in the national capital to nature and restore the river to its pristine state, the report says. DDA is also planning to provide water treatment solution for the Yamuna which will be a seperate project.

On April 12, Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal has directed the DDA to develop the Yamuna riverfront. He had asked all stakeholders and agencies to work in tandem and develop the Yamuna riverfront during a meeting with DDA. Baijal had said besides environmental benefits, tourism and economy will also get a major boost through this move.

In the budget for 2017-18, the AAP government had set aside Rs 119 crore for the tourism sector. According to the report, Delhi government was to prepare a tourism policy and develop the Yamuna riverfront. The need for a tourism policy for Delhi has been felt for a long period, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had said while presenting the budget in Delhi Assembly. Sisodia had said that the government has planned to develop the riverfront of the Yamuna. It is proposed to make world-class ecological riverfront of 5 km upstream of Wazirabad, he had said.

Russia's trust-based ties with India will not be diluted: Vladimir Putin President Vladimir Putin asserted on Thursday that Russia's ""trust-based"" relations with India - which he described as one of its ""closest friends"" - will not be diluted by Moscow's growing ties with Pakistan and other countries.

NEW DELHI: India and Russia have together denied that Russian President Vladimir Putin had suggested to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif that he could mediate between India and Pakistan.Responding to questions, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Gopal Baglay said, ""No offer of mediation between India and Pakistan was made by Russia to India.It is my understanding that Russia is very well aware of India's consistent position to address all outstanding issues with Pakistan bilaterally in an environment free of terrorism and violence.""It started with a report in the Pakistan media, which was followed by the Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria officially welcoming the Russian ""offer"" of mediation.According to them, this was part of the conversation between Nawaz Sharif and Putin in Astana, on the sidelines of the SCO summit.On Thursday, however, the Russian embassy in India denied there was any such move.According to Russian officials here, ""According to our information, this aspect was not discussed at the meeting in Astana and no statement in this regard was ever made by President Putin."" Pakistan attempted to put this out as a sign that Russia was changing its stance vis-a-vis this region, particularly being more sensitive towards Pakistan.It has not been an easy summer for Pakistan. First Nawaz Sharif travelled to Riyadh to be the first South Asian leader to meet US President Donald Trump. However, Trump refused to meet him. In Astana, Sharif suffered the ignominy of not getting a bilateral with Pakistan's chief benefactor, Chinese President Xi Jinping.In fact, Sharif 's ""non-meeting"" with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been the most important so far. Pakistan has been pushing both India and all its other interlocutors to get New Delhi to restart the bilateral dialogue. India has so far refused.

**Agriculture Minister, Roasted For Yoga Amid Crisis, Cancels China Trip** 

 ______ 
Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh cancelled his China trip due to
farmers' agitation in the country.

**NEW DELHI: **

Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has announced that he had put off his
China visit beginning tomorrow in view of the ongoing farmers' agitation. Mr
Singh had been criticised by the opposition for participating in Ramdev's yoga
camp last week a day after five farmers died in police firing in Madhya
Pradesh.

This afternoon he announced that he was slated to travel to China for three
days beginning June 15 for a meeting of the BRICS Forum, that comprises
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Arica. But he had put off the visit and
instead, deputed a top agriculture ministry official to represent him.

An agriculture ministry statement said the minister had decided to stay back
in the country to be able to give ""every possible help to farmers in the
current environment"".

Last week, a day after five farmers died in Mandsaur, Mr Singh was seen at a
yoga camp with Ramdev in Bihar's Motihari, the minister's hometown and
parliamentary constituency. When reporters asked him to comment on the deaths,
he replied, ""Yoga kijiye (practice yoga)"".

The reaction was criticized on social media and by the opposition Congress,
which spent the week trying to meet the farmers in Mandsaur. Government
officials had tried to defend the minister, saying the central government had
little role to play in controlling a state agitation and the state was
equipped to handle the situation.

Mr Singh's decision also comes on a day Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj
Singh Chouhan - who had earlier called off his indefinite fast within 28 hours
-reached out to the families of the deceased farmers in Mandsaur, the
epicentre of violent farmers' protests in the state.

In Delhi, the Narendra Modi government has cleared continuation of an interest
subsidy scheme for farmers who seek a short-term farm loans.

**Presidential election 2017: PM Modi may have bigger plans for Metro Man Sreedharan** 

 ______ 
Highlights Kerala CM wrote to PMO asking it to revise the seating plan

Later, PMO said Sreedharan has been included in list of dignitaries

PMO sources said Sreedharan may be nominated as NDA's candidate for President's post

The exclusion of 'Metro Man' E Sreedharan's name initially from the list of dignitaries who would share the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi when the latter would inaugurate the Kochi Metro train on Saturday had created brouhaha.

The Pinari Vijayan government of Kerala wrote to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) asking it to revise the seating plan.

Later in the day, the PMO said Sreedharan has been included in the list of dignitaries. This puts an end to the controversy over the non-inclusion of DMRC principal adviser Sreedharan.

However, sources told India Today that PMO had deliberately omitted Sreedharan's name even though he has played a pivotal role in the building of Kochi Metro.

METRO MAN IN THE LOOP

""In fact, there is a strong probability of Sreedharan being nominated as the ruling BJP-led NDA's candidate for the president's post in the July 17 election. It would be improper if he is seen sitting with PM Modi and Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on the dais just days before the name of the NDA candidate is announced. Moreover, PM Modi maintains distance with the person he has to push up,"" the sources said.

PMO has kept Sreedharan in the loop, they added. This is one of the reasons why the 'Metro Man' did not object to his exclusion because he was in the know of things.

According to reports, the Kerala government had submitted to PMO a list of 17 people who it wanted to share the dais with PM Narendra Modi. The list included the names of Sreedharan, Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, former CM Oommen Chandy, local legislator PT Thomas Chennithala and Chief Secretary Nailin Netto, among others. But the PMO approved the names of just six people. Kochi Metro Rail Corp managing director Elias George said the final list was made by PMO.

The PMO's earlier decision to omit Sreedharan's name had created a furore with the Opposition lambasting the ruling BJP.

UNPERTURBED BY THE CONTROVERSY

However, the man at the centre of the controversy is least perturbed. According to reports, he said there was ""nothing unusual about the decision and that he accepted it"". He said he had no complaints and that he would certainly attend the function. ""No need to raise controversy over this issue. The PM's security is more important. I am not at all hurt,"" he told a section of the media.

The sources said BJP had initially decided to nominate finance minister Arun Jaitley as the NDA's candidate for the president's post. After Jaitley refused the offer, BJP's choice has fallen on Sreedharan, the sources said.

OTHER LEADERS FOR THE POST

The other BJP leaders whose names were in the reckoning were LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj, MM Joshi and Sumitra Mahajan. But Jaitley was considered the most suitable for the post. His acceptability among most of the political parties, including the Opposition, was one of the important points which went in his favour.

However, Jaitley declined the offer. Had he agreed to the original plan, PM Modi would have got a chance to appoint someone else to steer the economy as the finance minister. Also, it would have been for the second consecutive that an incumbent finance minister would have been elevated as president. President Pranab Mukherjee is the first one in this regard.

After Jaitley refused the offer, BJP's choice has fallen on Sreedharan, the sources said.

They said the next president is likely to be from the southern part of the country - be he Sreedharan, Kerala Governor P Sathasivam or superstar Rajinikanth. The move is aimed at garnering more people support during the 2019 general elections.

**Cattle slaughter crackdown ripples through India’s leather industry** 

 ______ 
Industry officials said the shock of ban, coming on the heels of crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.

In the backstreets of Agra’s Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community. The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry.

Last month Modi’s government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.

Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts – including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks.

Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.

SOCIAL TENSIONS

Much of India’s meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.

But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.

Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India’s Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100.

The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India’s poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.

Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government’s move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry’s image.

Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad.

Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.

When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.

“They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread,” says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.

Muqeem’s monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.

IMPOSSIBLE TARGET

Like meat, India’s leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.

Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.

Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara did not respond to requests for comment.

India is one of the world’s top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.

Modi’s government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion – more than double today’s level – by 2020 as part of a job creation push.

But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production – a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.

India’s environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.

But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.

Companies say the government’s leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.

“There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow,” Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.

“There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.” India’s commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.

About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.

Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra’s leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.

The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.

Modi’s election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.

When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: “Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.”

In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.

“Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits,” he said in Lucknow, the state capital.

WIDER INDUSTRY HIT

In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.

Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur’s Small Tanners’ Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur’s leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers’ organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.

“More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear,” said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism’s social hierarchy once called “untouchables” are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.

Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month – down from 25,000 – because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month’s inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.

Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem’s cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.

He now earns 3,000 rupees – or $47 – a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father’s income supports three sisters and his mother. “I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here,” he said.

A day after news emerged that ‘Metro Man’ E. Sreedharan’s name was not on the list of dignitaries who will be on the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the inauguration of Kochi Metro, Sreedharan sought to downplay the incident on Thursday saying he was not disappointed and that security of the Prime Minister is important. In a statement to news agency ANI, Sreedharan said, “Don’t make it into a controversy. Security of PM is important, must follow what security agency says. I am not disappointed.”

The Kerala government on Wednesday had sent a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office urging it to reconsider the decision and include him among the guests. Sreedharan is principal adviser to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which completed the project in four years. News of his name missing from the list of dignitaries to be present on the dais with the Prime Minister sparked a controversy in Kerala, where the project has been riding on the image of the ‘Metro Man’, as Sreedharan is popularly called. Also read: E Sreedharan’s name missing from list of dignitaries for Kochi Metro inauguration, Kerala writes to PMO

The programme, which was cleared by PMO, also did not include names of Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and local legislator P T Thomas among guests on the dais. The state government had reportedly sent a list of 17 people who it wanted to share the dais with PM Modi. Some names included Sreedharan, Chennithala, Thomas and Chief Secretary Nailin Netto, among others.

**Air India privatisation: Government may write off dues up to Rs 30,000 crore** 

 ______ 
The government has firmed up a plan to exit the loss-making national carrier Air India, involving the write-off of roughly half of its estimated liabilities of Rs 60,000 crore. (PTI)

The government has firmed up a plan to exit the loss-making national carrier Air India, involving the write-off of roughly half of its estimated liabilities of Rs 60,000 crore, with a possible haircut by banks reducing the cost of the exercise to the exchequer. While the write-off is of the carrier’s liabilities not backed by assets, the government might also have to incur an expenditure for the settlement of the sovereign-backed part of AI’s aircraft loan of about Rs 21,000 crore, sources privy to the matter told FE. A third of the carrier’s aircraft loan is guaranteed by the government. A Cabinet note formulated in this regard is set to be discussed by the council of ministers headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon, the sources said. However, they added that lenders to the carrier have in informal talks with the government expressed their willingness to negotiate with the government on how to settle the AI loans including re-setting interest rates to accommodate the government’s plan.

The sources added that the civil aviation ministry has also internally made a rough estimate of the value of AI’s physical assets including its 115-strong aircraft fleet (including Boeing Dreamliners), land parcels, buildings and also its valuable flying/landing rights and parking slots at airports across the world. “These assets are worth around Rs 25,000-30,000 crore,” a source said, adding that the government could quit AI by end-March 2018 and transfer it to a new private-sector owner.

Besides issues related to debt, the government would also have to take a call whether it would like to retain a minority stake in AI or not, another official said. It is understood that the Cabinet note doesn’t bar foreign airlines from participating in the acquisition of AI. Current FDI rules allow foreign airlines to buy up to 49% stake in Indian airlines.After the Cabinet gives its in-principle approval to the proposals by June-end, the government would appoint transaction advisers and asset valuers to take forward the divestment process.

While efforts have been made to revive the airline, AI has not reported a profit in at least a decade; in 2015-16 it posted an operating profit of Rs 105 crore and reduced its net loss to Rs 3,837 crore compared with Rs 5,859 crore in 2014-15.Retaining the airline in its fold is a much more expensive proposition for the government than transferring the ownership. The government will require to infuse amounts much higher than the Rs 50,000 crore proposed under a revival plan for AI if it decides to hang in there. The Centre has already infused Rs 28,000 crore in the airline over the past few years. The airline is incurring a cash loss of Rs 200 crore every month.

**Former Delhi Metro chief E Sreedharan as NDA’s nominee for Presidential poll?** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: BJP negotiators reached out to NCP chief Sharad Pawar and TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu over the presidential poll in a bid to enlarge a consensus over an NDA nominee.The outreach came even as speculation continued about the NDA's likely choice with a news website suggesting that former Delhi Metro chief E Sreedharan could be in consideration even though the possibility of a non-political selection is remote.BJP has not suggested any name so far, with party chief Amit Shah having said this will not be revealed prematurely.Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu spoke to Pawar and will meet the veteran Maharashtra neta soon. It is understood that the TDP chief does not have a specific criteria and will be willing to consider any choice put forward by PM Narendra Modi BJP sources said Naidu and home minister Rajnath Singh are likely to seek suggestions from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi who they are scheduled to meet on Friday. ""We would like to hear what the opposition is considering and keep that in the discussions on the presidential candidate,"" a BJP member said.The talks have revealed room for consensus though Left parties remain opposed to any NDA nominee. Congress has reservations too, though its spokesperson said there is need for consensus.This may suggest that BJP needs to pick a choice acceptable to the opposition. Congress on Thursday said the party would prefer a consensus candidate and it would be good if the government understood the need for unanimity on the issue.AICC spokesperson Anand Sharma said, ""Congress has tried to bring about a consensus on every important issue. But the picture is not yet clear on the issue of the presidential election.""

**GST rules for cell towers a ‘regressive’ step: TAIPA** 

 ______ 
Mobile tower companies, in their 15th submission to the government on GST, said the move will either lead to increase in cost of mobile services to end consumers or deepen stress of the sector. Mobile tower companies, in their 15th submission to the government on GST, said the move will either lead to increase in cost of mobile services to end consumers or deepen stress of the sector.

Mobile tower companies have termed the government’s move to not allow tax adjustments on bills they raise to telecom operators as “a retrograde and regressive step”, saying it will adversely impact telecom infrastructure rollout in the country.

Mobile tower companies, in their 15th submission to the government on GST, said the move will either lead to increase in cost of mobile services to end consumers or deepen stress of the sector. “It is a retrograde and regressive step taken by the government as it will impact the overall telecom infrastructure rollout across the nation. Further, Indian telecom sector will witness more stressed financial burden due to these developments,” Industry body TAIPA, Director General, Tilak Raj Dua said in a statement.

The government has increased tax rate under GST on telecom services from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, which will make phones bills expensive from July 1. “Considering the current financial health of the telecom industry under the debt of 4.5 lakh crore and ongoing hyper competition in the industry, it is imperative that the non-availability of input tax credit (CENVAT credit) and higher tax rate will impact the overall cost of services and billing by IP-1s to TSPs (Telecom Service Providers),” the statement said.

TAIPA said that the telecom infrastructure industry makes a direct contribution of more than Rs 5,000 crore annually in corporate income tax and service tax and invests more than Rs 10,000 crore annually in equipment’s like towers, shelters, batteries, air-conditioners, DG sets etc.

“In a nutshell, such non-inclusion will impact the penetration of telecom services to the bottom of pyramid as this will shoot either cost of services or due to the ongoing hyper competition TSPs may not pass it to customer, which will further stream the financial burden on the industry,” the statement said.

It said that from initiatives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi such as Digital India, Smart Cities, E-Governance services and connecting the bottom of pyramid depends over the availability of critical telecom infrastructure.

“For (the) government, it is important to realise that telecommunication services now a days are essential services and need to be extended to bottom of pyramid for developing one connected nation. Over and above, it completely trembles investors interest in the country,” Dua said.

What evidence have you offered for,

* Modi being insecure or ego driven,
* Modi not listening to others,
* E Sreedharan will challenge Modi,
* Either of them have a better intellect than the other. 

What you have done is, taken your bias, added a large dollop of Twitter propaganda and arrived at this raita. 

Modi has in his own cabinet a person of the stature of Piyush Goyal, who was all India second in the CA exam, has been a high level investment banker, or a Jaswant Sinha, who has Ivy League credentials and again, was a successful investment banker. We also know that Modi does look away from past slights, Smriti Irani lead a fast unto death, demanding the removal of Modi (in 2004), an egotistical or insecure man, would have finished her political career, but here she is, a former cabinet minister and now textile minister. He is known to listen and trust his trusted IAS officers fully, and in fact one complaint is, outside of capable and trusted ministers, like Goyal, Prabhu, Swaraj and to a certain extent Rajnath Singh, he runs his administration entirely via IAS officers. 

Yes, he can be extremely vengeful against political opponents and threats, he has ended the careers of many such threats, Keshubhai Patel being one example, but that is not the same as what you allege.

Coming from nowhere, to becoming the PM of India and then successfully running a government to full term while winning state election after state election requires a lot of intellect. 

&gt;the faculty of reasoning and understanding objectively, especially with regard to abstract matters.

This is how intellect is defined. If you think just the art of politics, vote banks, caste equations are all not abstract matters, let alone the other challenges that come with running a nation with 1.3 billion people, does not require an intellect,  I don't know what that word even means. 

Problem is, to people like you, intellect has a very narrow, elitist definition. Anybody who has studied in an Ivy League school or IIT is an intellectual. Also, if you hate Modi and have some random work published somewhere, you become an intellectual. 

Drop the elitism first and you will understand India a lot better. Nobody hates intellectuals, but yes there is a lot of derision for those who straitjacket this term based on political bias. ",2017-06-16 10:52:59

**SADANAND DHUME JUNE 15, 2017**

Is media freedom in India under threat? A government investigative agency’s raids earlier this month on the founders of New Delhi Television, a prominent private broadcaster, have triggered a fierce debate in the country over this perennial question.

Critics accuse the government of Narendra Modi of fostering an environment that makes ordinary journalists afraid or unable to do their jobs. Many in the media cannot remember a time when they had to watch their step so carefully.

To the prime minister’s vocal fans, especially on social media, this is hogwash. They view much of the elite English-language media as ethically challenged and unremittingly hostile to the government.

While some of the more excitable crusaders for press freedom may exaggerate the problem—India is in no danger of becoming another Russia or Turkey any time soon—on the whole they are more right than wrong. On Mr. Modi’s watch, the space to criticize the government or the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party without fear of retaliation has indeed shrunk. If the action against NDTV is a portent, then in the run-up to the 2019 elections this space may shrink even more.

The government argues that its tussle with NDTV founders Radhika and Prannoy Roy has nothing do with media freedom. According to investigators, the Roys violated the law by obtaining a partial waiver of interest on a 2008 loan worth about 3.5 billion rupees (about $70 million at the time) from private bank ICICI.

In anonymous leaks to sympathetic media outlets, alleged government officials suggest they may also pursue more serious charges, including money laundering and concealment of income. NDTV denies any wrongdoing, and accuses the government of “an unsubstantiated, politically motivated and vindictive campaign” against it.

The government’s argument appears shaky. In India, large borrowers owe government-owned banks many billions of dollars. That the Central Bureau of Investigation’s case hinges on a nine-year-old loan repaid to a private bank seems to suggest, at the very least, an odd set of priorities.

The move against NDTV comes against the backdrop of a media landscape that has tilted noticeably toward the government. Prominent news channels now spend more time attacking the enfeebled opposition than scrutinizing the government. The front pages of several major newspapers increasingly read like official press releases. The burden of holding the government accountable for its missteps has largely shifted to opinion writers and a clutch of online publications with far less reach than TV or newspapers.

For the most part, Mr. Modi eschews interviews and press conferences, preferring to communicate directly through Facebook , Twitter and a regular radio address. His junior foreign minister, V.K. Singh, has helped popularize the pejorative term “presstitute” to describe journalists.

The BJP pays lip service to the idea of a free press, but one that knows its place. In party President Amit Shah’s formulation, criticizing the government remains permissible but criticizing the nation is out of bounds.

Earlier this year, the party appointed as its spokesperson Tajinder Bagga, notorious for a televised 2011 assault on a left-wing lawyer and anticorruption activist he deemed too sympathetic to Kashmiri separatists. “He try to break my Nation, i try to break his head,” Mr. Bagga tweeted at the time.

Mr. Modi’s supporters tend to dismiss concerns voiced by journalists as much ado about nothing. And it’s certainly true that, unlike many developing countries, India remains a place where you can call the prime minister an imbecile without facing a lawsuit or a midnight knock on the door from a thug. Government critics are feted at literary festivals and regularly published in the most prestigious op-ed pages. They may lose access to top officials, but they aren’t queuing up for asylum in Sweden or languishing in prison.

Moreover, most of the Indian media’s problems predate Mr. Modi’s 2014 election. The owners of most major TV channels and newspapers juggle other business interests as well. They must negotiate a plethora of opaque laws and regulations that would make them vulnerable to government pressure. Many outlets also rely on government advertising to stay afloat. All this ensures that Indian journalism maintains a long tradition of kissing up to power rather than questioning it.

Things have nonetheless deteriorated on Mr. Modi’s watch. This government is particularly ruthless about cutting off access to reporters it deems unfriendly. The BJP also appears to at least tacitly encourage social-media lynch mobs that go after any journalist seen to be stepping out of line. No other major political party appoints trolls to responsible positions.

It may still be easier to practice journalism in Mr. Modi’s India than in Vladimir Putin’s Russia or Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey. But for a country that prides itself as the world’s largest democracy, that isn’t saying much.

**Narendra Modi government finally manages to break the Swiss bank black money vault** 

 ______ 
Switzerland's age of banking secrecy is finally coming to an end. On Friday, Switzerland ratified automatic exchange of financial account information with India, marking another step in addressing the menace of black money stashed abroad.With this move, India should be able to access transactions by Indians with Swiss banks after September 2019.This is a big boost for Modi government's move against black money. It will now be possible for India to receive from September, 2019 onwards, the financial information of accounts held by Indian residents in Switzerland for 2018 and subsequent years, on an automatic basis.The finance ministry, last year, had noted that that there is no official estimation regarding black money of Indians stacked in Swiss banks.The issue of black money has been a matter of great debate in India and Switzerland has been long perceived as one of the safest havens for the illicit wealth allegedly stashed abroad by Indians.Today's decision follows hectic parleys between India and Switzerland for introduction of the AEOI (Automatic Exchange of Information) on tax matters under the guidance of G20, OECDand other global organisations.The council said the proposal to introduce AEOI withIndia and others ""met with widespread approval from the interested parties who voiced their opinions in the consultations"".""In concrete terms, the AEOI will be activated with eachindividual state or territory by means of a specific federaldecree within the framework of this dispatch,"" it added.The exchange of information itself will be carried outbased on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA)on the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, which is in turn based on the international standard for theexchange of information developed by the Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD).The council said it will prepare a situation reportbefore the first exchange of data, which is planned for autumn2019.""In the process, it will be checked whether the statesand territories concerned effectively meet the requirementsunder the standard, especially those concerningconfidentiality and data security.""It is important for the Federal Council that a levelplaying field be created among states and that all majorfinancial centres, in particular, be included. This year, Switzerland has introduced the AEOI with 38 states and territories, including all EU member states, and data will start to be exchanged with them in 2018,"" it added.In the recent past, the government has taken several steps to effectively tackle the issue of black money, which include policy-level initiatives, more effective enforcement action on the ground, putting in place robust legislative and administrative frameworks, and integration of information and its mining through increasing use of information technology.A new law - 'The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015' - has been enacted to specifically and effectively tackle the issue of black money stashed away abroad.The government had also given a one-time three months' compliance window under the new law wherein 648 declarations involving undisclosed foreign assets worth Rs 4,164 crore were made. The amount collected by way of tax and penalty in such cases was Rs 2,476 crore.

The Kochi Metro officials Monday held a ‘Sadhya’ for all its migrant workers for working on the metro project. The ‘Sadhya’, which is a traditional banquet, was held for 800 workers ahead of the inauguration of the metro service. “It has been a long journey for the whole team of Kochi Metro Rail Limited, and we would like to take a bow to all our fellow labourers and other workers for doing their part in making our Kochi’s dream, a reality,” a post on the Kochi Metro Rail’s Facebook page said.

Other officials, apart from the workers were also present. The banquet also included some performances and programs for everyone as well.

“Kochi Metro Rail Limited has given a feast to the labours of Kochi Metro at SS Kalamandir near TD road. KMRL officials along with MD, Elias George IAS were a part of the feast. Some programs were also there to entertain the labourers. To show the support, the labourers have jotted down their names on the message board,” it said.

The Kochi Metro will be India’s eighth and the first in a tier-II city. It will go into commercial operation once Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates it on June 17. The operationalisation of the first phase will be the first step towards an integrated public transport system that will include feeder services with boats — called Water Metro, being set up at Rs 800 crore — as well as buses, the existing network for which is being restructured. A prepaid card, Kochi One, will be launched for use in all services of the integrated network.

The Metro itself is being set up at Rs 6,000 crore, with the construction executed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), for operation by the Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). Of a total route length of 26 km with 22 stations, the first phase will run 13 km covering 11 stations.

Saffron, white, green doesn't make something a flag.

But used on the map of the country, the tricolor *resembles* a flag. Given the uber nationalism in this country at the moment, much of it being fanned by BJP, it would be fair to ask if modi allowing his image in place of ashok charka has disrespected the symbolism of the flag.

And? Do we need to follow Saudis? 

&gt;The things you argued can be applied to Gita as well

Yeah and the geeta has intrinsic value too, you can read and gain new perspective about our culture and values, the same cannot be said about a small plastic replica of taj mehal. 

A taj mehal replica will at best be an eyecandy and at worst it'll be a paperweight, it has no other value. 

&gt;It has nothing to do abt pushing Indian history into a dignatary's mind, its a gesture in form of something well known and associated with Indias culture.

Indians don't associate taj mahal with India the same way a french person doesn't associate Eiffel tower with France. Taj mahal is associated with India only in the west and you know what else is India associated with in the west? Snake charmers, third world poor people, tech support, Apu from Simpsons, take your pick. Should we start gifting dignitaries a small been as it is associated with our culture? 

&gt;Yes, I prefer a state gift of Pyramid model, one of the wonders of the world, over some book I can't relate to.

You don't relate to books, you read them. If you're fine with your knowledge of Egypt limited to only the pyramids then I can't change your mind, but if you think Egypt is more than a few rocks arranged in the shape of a pyramid then you'll find the book to be more interesting than a plastic shaped in the shape of a pyramid.

Well, I kinda associate and take pride in Taj Mahal, and I know many who does the same. And when I think about France, its Eiffel Tower that comes to my mind than a copy of Bible or the Louvre.

**To Flush Out Black Money, PM Modi Government Gets A Direct Line With Swiss** 

 ______ 
Switzerland will exchange the first set of financial data with India in 2019.
(Representational)

**New Delhi: **

Starting 2019, India and Switzerland will exchange financial account
information - a move meant to flush out black money, much of which is parked
in Swiss banks.

The Swiss government formally ratified automatic exchange of financial account
information with India today. The first set of data will be exchanged in 2019.

Flushing out black money is one of the key initiatives of the Narendra Modi
government, which swept to power in 2014 on an anti-corruption plank.

""This year, Switzerland has introduced the AEOI (Automatic Exchange of
Information) with 38 states and territories, including all EU (European Union)
member states and data will start to be exchanged with them in 2018,"" the
Swiss Federal Council said today. The council is the top Governing body of the
nation.

Switzerland, however, has asked that confidentiality and data security rules
be strictly maintained. The Swiss Federal council also said it will prepare a
situation report before the first exchange of data, planned for the autumn of
2019.

India had joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement - the
60-nation body committed to automatic exchange of financial information in
2015.

The deal obliges the nations to share a wide range of financial information
from its financial institutions. The information, the government has said,
includes ""information about the ultimate controlling persons and beneficial
owners of entities"".

Once the AEOI is implemented, India would be able to receive information from
almost every country in the world including offshore financial centres. It
would provide information about the assets of Indians held abroad and help
stop international tax evasion.

**Big win for Modi government war on black money, Switzerland to share account info; key things to know and how this system works** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi.(IE)

It’s a big achievement for Narendra Modi government against its fight against black money as it was one of the key poll promises by Narendra Modi during 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign. Finally, Switzerland on Friday ratified automatic exchange of financial account information with India to facilitate immediate sharing of details about suspected black money. But, Switzerland has sought strict adherence to confidentiality and data security. Here are key things to know and details of how will this system work:-

– The Swiss Federal Council says the implementation is planned for 2018 and the first set of data should be exchanged in 2019.

– Swiss Federal Council, which is the top governing body of the European nation, will soon notify the Narendra Modi-led Indian government about the exact date from which the automatic exchange would begin.

You may also like to watch:

– As per the draft notification approved by the council in its meeting on Friday, the decision is not subject to any referendum – which means there should be no further procedural delay in its implementation.

– The decision follows hectic parleys between India and Switzerland for introduction of the AEOI (Automatic Exchange of Information) on tax matters under the guidance of G20, OECD and other global organisations.

– The council said the proposal to introduce AEOI, a global convention for automatic information exchange on tax matters, with India and others “met with widespread approval from the interested parties who voiced their opinions in the consultations”.

“In concrete terms, the AEOI will be activated with each individual state or territory by means of a specific federal decree within the framework of this dispatch,” it added.

– The exchange of information itself will be carried out based on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, which is in turn based on the international standard for the exchange of information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

– The council said it will prepare a situation report before the first exchange of data, which is planned for autumn 2019.

– “In the process, it will be checked whether the states and territories concerned effectively meet the requirements under the standard, especially those concerning confidentiality and data security. It is important for the Federal Council that a level playing field be created among states and that all major financial centres, in particular, be included. This year, Switzerland has introduced the AEOI with 38 states and territories, including all EU member states, and data will start to be exchanged with them in 2018,” it added.

Black money

The issue of black money has been a matter of great debate in India and Switzerland has been long perceived as one of the safest havens for the illicit wealth allegedly stashed abroad by Indians.

 ______ 
NEW YORK: The CBI has responded strongly to a New York Times editorial on the NDTV raids, calling it ""one-sided"" and asserting India does not require ""any lesson"" on freedom of the press from the US daily.In response to the June 7 editorial 'India's Battered Press', the CBI's press information officer and spokesman RK Gaur said the editorial ""gives the impression"" that action is not being taken against other big loan defaulters and that the raids on NDTV's founders were a part of a ""vendetta"" against the broadcaster.""The editorial is one-sided and doesn't consider the investigation history of the case against RRPR Holdings , NDTV's holding company, by different tax and law enforcement agencies in India since 2011,"" he said.Gaur said in the entire case against the NDTV ""due process of law"" is being followed.""India has a robust and independent judiciary that strongly protects democratic freedom and that an aggrieved person can always approach. India does not require any lesson on freedom of the press from The Times,"" he said in his letter to the Editor, adding ""our institutions and traditions are nurtured by our rich and diverse cultural heritage and democratic ethos.""The editorial had said that even as India's state-owned banks are holding bad debt of about $186 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ""hesitated to go after big defaulters"".""But suddenly we have dramatic raids against the founders of an influential media company -- years after a loan was settled to a private bank's satisfaction,"" the editorial said.In his letter to NYT, Gaur said the Central Bureau of Investigation is currently investigating over 100 criminal cases worth a total loan default of over USD 5 billion.""Many of the leading loan defaulters are behind bars, their assets attached, and prosecutions are being pursued vigorously in the courts,"" he said.Gaur noted that ICICI bank's loss is merely tip of the iceberg and that RRPR Holdings is also being investigated for irregularities in the mobilisation of funds used for loan repayment. He alleged there have also been serious defaults in tax payment.To the NYT editorial's assertion that NDTV Hindi was taken off the air for a day for reporting on a sensitive attack on an air base, Gaur said the decision was arrived at after a proper inquiry in which NDTV also participated.""No democracy can allow the country's security and public safety to be compromised by irresponsible reporting of terrorist incidents,"" he said.The New York Times editorial board had said that press freedom in India ""suffered a fresh blow"" when the CBI raided homes and offices connected to founders of NDTV.""The raids mark an alarming new level of intimidation of India's news media under Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" the editorial had said.

NEW DELHI: It is going to be a busy travel schedule for ministers in the Narendra Modi government till the end of the first week of July.The government and BJP have decided to observe June 25-26 as Anti-Emergency day across the country by deputing Union ministers to attend various events across state capitals.Recalling that in the midnight of June 25, 1975, Indira Gandhi-led Congress government had imposed the Emergency, information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu wrote to his colleagues, ""It is a 'Black Day' in the Constitutional democracy of independent India.""In a letter, the minister said, ""We, a democratic and nationalistic party, observe the day as such to reinforce our firm commitment against subversion of democratic values.""The decision to mark the 'Anti-Emergency Day' comes at a time the opposition is attacking the ruling dispensation for allegedly imposing an ""undeclared emergency"" in the country.With the GST (Goods and Services Tax) rollout slated for July 1, the Narendra Modi government plans to send out its top ministers and leaders across the country to ""dispel any confusion"" and explain to stakeholders the issues that may arise during the implementation of the new regime.The government is preparing a detailed list of ministers who will be going out to different cities between July 2 and 7 to discuss with industry groups, traders, small businessmen and others who will come under the new tax system.Many ministers have been asked to postpone or cancel other programmes during this period as implementing GST is a priority for the Centre. In fact, ministers also have a travel schedule chalked out for the World Yoga Day on June 21.Schedules are being drawn to assign cities to ministers for the Yoga Day programmes . Those travelling abroad on that day may even participate in functions there in coordination with the Indian embassies.

This was the claim made by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kochi through posters ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the city to inaugurate the Kochi Metro on June 17, 2017.

The project was approved during the second term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh from May 2009 to May 2014.

The 13-km Aluva–Palarivattom section of the 27 km Line-1 of Kochi Metro project, which will be by PM Modi, received the union cabinet nod on July 4, 2012, according to this release by the Press Information Bureau.

The foundation stone of the Kochi Metro was laid by Dr Singh on September 13, 2012.

The Kochi Metro is estimated to cost Rs 5,181.79 crore. It is being built by the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd, a special purpose vehicle of the central and state governments, equally owned by both.

Kochi Metro Rail Funding Project Funds Sanctioned During (2013-16) Funds Released and Utilised During (2013-16) Sanctioned Funds in (2016-17) Amount Released and Utilised in Current year* Kochi Metro Rs 1329.95 crore Rs 1309.95 crore Rs 450 crore Rs 434 crore

Source: Lok Sabha; *up to 25.01.2017; Figures in Rs crore

The Kochi Metro project has been commissioned in a record 45 months, faster than India’s other metro projects, Mint reported on June 16, 2017.

In a few hours #KochiMetro will become a reality. #KeralaLeads @MetroRailKochi pic.twitter.com/M2lhSWpwrU — CMO Kerala (@CMOKerala) June 15, 2017

Up to 80% of the Kochi Metro’s employees are likely to be women, again, likely to be a national landmark. The company has already hired 23 transgenders across 11 metro stations at different posts.

Metro rail lines now operate in seven cities—Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur Mumbai and Gurgaon — with a combined length of 326 km.

Metro projects with a combined length 546 km are under construction in 11 cities and being planned in 13 additional cities.

India has great metro rail opportunity, as the projects, once implemented and operationalised, will help bring down traffic, accidental deaths and fuel consumption, IndiaSpend reported on January 20, 2015.

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).

The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states — Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the “temporary decline” in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.

One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation — one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard — more appropriately, a changing of the elites.

The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).

The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasn’t an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.

As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the public’s increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy — and power corrupted the old elite.

The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite — politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics — cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.

This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.

The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malle’s nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?

It is important that history be re-written — all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years — by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.

In my previous article (‘Just why are farmers rioting’, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved — so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation — true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.

The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation — fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers — their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers — close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is a

Now, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the “farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output” flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal — reduce cash transactions — has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts — RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.

There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The “experts” only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!

The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions “induced” by demonetisation — debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile — are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?

180,"""This is a complete fraud on Democracy. This Govt. led by Modi is out to cheat people at every opportunity. Let me explain this point to you in a gist. Read the link for full info.

1. As of now the base year taken for comparing the economic performance of the country is 2011-12. The meaning of this is as under. If you compare the performance of 2016-17, against 2011-12, you will get to know as to how the economy has performed in the last 5 years, on critical economic indicators, like GDP, Inflation, Exports, Imports, Employment and such others.

2. None of these parameters are looking good now. Now Modi has come up with the simple trick to hide all of these. He does not carry a single good intention towards the country. His only objective is to stay in power and let his cronies make money. Understand the implications of changing the base year to 2017-18.

3. Let us take the example of say ""the % age growth in Exports"" over the last 5 years. Here 2011-12 will be taken as 100, being base year. For 2016-17, the figure could be 93 as against 100 of 2011-12. Everyone will immediately get to know that Exports have been slipping quite badly, by looking at this figure. For 2018-19, it could go to 86, the way things are going.

4. Now because of 2019 General Elections Modi wants to desperately hide things. So instead of keeping 2011-12, he wants to change the base year to 2017-18. What will happen then. 2017-18 will be taken as 100. May be the year 2018-19 may achieve 2 % growth in comparison to previous year and 100 will be taken to 102. Modi &amp; co. will then start trumpeting about ""export growth"" just before elections. In reality, it could be 88 or 12% reduction, when compared to earlier base year of 2011 -12.

5. World over, the base years are generally changed once in 10 years and taken forward by just 3-4 years, to enable a 6-7 year ""comparative performance"". Here everything is pushed under the carpet. Yet another monumental fraud by adopting a new base year, which is just 1 year before.

This Govt. is shameless on all fronts. Incorrigible. Anyone can come &amp; defend it.""

**You, according to fake news** 

 ______ 
A good lie is never known as a lie. A famous lie is a different matter. A lie that is famously a lie is the very opposite of a good lie. How then does it become popular? In the answer lies the true nature of “fake news”, which is an unsatisfactory name given to a broad range of things—fabricated information, propaganda, rumours, pranks and hoaxes.

You may have wondered why you are reading so many articles about fake news these days. The matter appears to be an internal crisis of journalism, so why must you be bothered so often by what interests journalists? But fake news is almost entirely about you. According to mainstream intellectual opinion, you are often a victim of fake news, a gullible simpleton who falls for any nonsense you read free of cost on the Internet, which you then transmit to your friends. But it is this hypothesis that is too simple. Something else is going on.

Several months ago, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced Rs2,000 notes, word spread that the notes were the most technologically advanced currency ever, so sophisticated that they could be traced by the government, even tracked a few metres underground, which was a nice touch. The popularity of the lie was on a par with the best lies that US President Donald Trump’s campaign had generated. For instance, the news that the Pope had endorsed his campaign. Most observers appear to believe that such lies contribute to the popularity of notorious public figures. But if this view were true, lies would be universally helpful, and the liar with the highest marketing budget would win. But that is not how it goes. All lies are not equal, and the most successful lies appear to help only a particular type of people.

When a public figure is immensely popular but reviled by an intellectual elite that has an outsized influence over the respectable media, then he does not become even more popular because a piece of fiction has gone viral. Rather, what appears more probable is that the piece of fiction goes viral because of the popularity of the public figure. Modi and Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin did not become popular because of the lies. The lies became popular because of them. Successful fake news contains excellent storytelling techniques—it has a strong protagonist who is very interesting because he is unpredictable, blunt and morally ambiguous, it captures the current of the times and it appears to be highly probable. It succeeds for the same reason that good yarns work well. People wish to believe it.

Truth is always slower than a convenient lie. That is why health myths, for instance, go deeper into the minds of people than health facts. The half-truth that exercise could make you fatter than sloth would always be more popular than the truth that complete abstinence from refined carbohydrates will have a profound effect on your well-being.

I do not suggest that fake news does not create misinformation at all, just that its transformative powers are overstated.

Yuval Noah Harari, a historian who is best known for his book Sapiens, argues that the very success of the human race lies in its ability to believe in fiction, which according to him includes religion and all political and economic ideologies. “Ever since the Stone Age, self-reinforcing myths have served to unite human collectives. Indeed, Homo sapiens conquered this planet thanks above all to the unique human ability to create and spread fictions,” he wrote in a Bloomberg View column. “The truth is that truth was never high on the agenda of Homo sapiens.”

Harari is speaking of powerful forces, like delusions and their ability to travel fast. Modern fake news is not always driven by such major elements. It is, instead, the minor after-effect of colossal fiction that has already been established, like the news of an idol drinking milk or the statue of a Jewish virgin shedding tears are minor effects of the establishment of two gigantic works of fiction.

The idea that a hugely popular lie is not influential but a reflection of current beliefs, should alter our perception of the most organized form of fake news—propaganda. Propaganda is usually generated by a dominant political force. The perception that propaganda was how, historically, evil men influenced ordinary people, is itself a form of fake news. Over the decades, artists and academics, who make a living out of sympathizing with social underdogs, have successfully created the myth that ordinary people are victims of propaganda. The German public of Hitler’s time, for instance, is only mildly implicated in his crimes while the fact is that their political views and disposition made it possible for the propaganda to be successful.

The conscientious liberals lament fascist propaganda and other forms of fake news but they, too, generate or transmit it. But their fake news never travels as fast and as wide as the right-wing fake news, and is almost never as successful. A few days ago, some people were excited by the cover of Time magazine, which is taken seriously these days only when there is a hoax. The cover called Donald Trump “Liar-in-chief”. Not surprisingly, intellectuals of a type loved it and passed it around. But when they realized it was a hoax, they had to take it down to guard their own reputation, and take it down with sheepish notes about how the image had come from very credible sources, how they were so very sorry for promoting a hoax.

About 15 years ago, the novelist and activist Arundhati Roy used some strands of fake news in her essay on the Gujarat riots. One suggested that Congress MP Ehsan Jafri’s daughter had been stripped and murdered, while she was safe thousands of kilometres away. Roy had no choice but to tender an apology, however grudging.

The transmission of liberal fake news is often slowed this way—by the strict requirements of decency. But intellectuals fall for and transmit fake news for the same reason that semi-literates do: The news corroborates their delusions.

**Govt has 7-point strategy to double farmers’ income: Prakash Javadekar** 

 ______ 
Vadodara: Amid growing unrest among farmers in different states, Union minister Prakash Javadekar has said the Narendra Modi-led government has set the target of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022 in the next five years through a seven-point strategy.

This seven point-strategy, unveiled by the prime minister last year, include measures to step up irrigation, provide better quality seeds and prevent post-harvest losses. “The NDA government has set the objective of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022. We are giving an emphasis on raising the farmers’ income rather than the past practice of increasing the agriculture output,” the human resources development (HRD) minister said.

He was speaking after inaugurating the three-day ‘Making of Developed India Mela’ (MODI Fest) at Anand about 40km from Vadodara on Friday. Elaborating on the seven-point strategy, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said, “There is a big focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of ‘per drop, more crop’; provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field; large investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post-harvest crop losses and promotion of value addition through food processing.

“Then, creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and e-platform across 585 stations; introduction of a new crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable cost and promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, beekeeping and fisheries, are also part of the strategy.”

The minister also said that introduction of smaller versions of neem-coated urea bags has helped in cutting the overall urea consumption and saved Rs7,000 crore subsidy annually. “Now, the urea bags have been made available in 45 kg, in place of the 50 kg bags available in the past. Usually, farmers calculate how much urea they need for one acre of farm land in terms of bags. So, by reducing five kgs from each urea bag, there has been a 10 per cent fall in urea consumption. Moreover, 45-kg of neem coated urea is equivalent to normal 50 kg bag. So there is less wastage,” he said.

According to Javadekar, the Centre has so far distributed seven crore soil health cards to the farmers.

**BJP state prez ride with Modi in Kochi metro a security breach, alleges minister** 

 ______ 
Kochi: BJP Kerala unit president Kummanam Rajasekharan’s ride with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the launch of the Kochi Metro on Saturday triggered a controversy, with a state minister alleging it was a “security breach.”

In a Facebook post, Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said the “security lapses” which occurred in the Prime Minister’s official programme should be investigated.

He questioned the logic behind allowing Rajasekharan, who is not even a panchayat ward member, to travel with Modi. Surendran said this happened when even local MLA P T Thomas was not allowed to share stage with the Prime Minister for the inaugural function.

Rajasekharan was seen seated next to Governor P Sathasivam when Modi, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu went for their maiden ride.

Hitting back at Surendran, BJP state General Secretary K Surendran said it was the Prime Minister’s Office which had included Rajasekharan in the journey.

“The PMO takes decision on matters like who will attend the Prime Minister’s function and the state minister need not worry about his protection,” he said.

The BJP leader said in a Facebook post that the Special Protection Group (SPG) is there to provide security for the Prime Minister and the minister’s intervention is not required.

Reacting to the issue, Rajasekharan said he was allowed to travel with the Prime Minister by the SPG and the state police.

“If Surendran had any objections, he should have taken up the matter with the chief minister as he was witness to everything,” he said.

**Infrastructure boost! Indian Railways set to get modern ‘Make in India’ locomotives; check out images and facts** 

 ______ 
Indian Railways is all set to get a new set of diesel locomotives that will replace an ageing fleet of engines. One such set of locomotives is being made by GE Transportation under the Modi government's 'Make in India' initiative. Most of these locomotives will be manufactured at GE factory in Bihar. GE recently unveiled the first of the 1000 Evolution Series diesel locomotives that will be supplied to the Indian Railways.



We take a look at some interesting facts about the locomotives that will help in enhancing traffic movement on the Railway network:

According to GE, the 1,000 locomotives will be delivered to Indian Railways over the next 10 years at the rate of 100 locomotives a year. Initially, 40 of the twin-cab 1,676 mm gauge locomotives will be exported from the US.

GE Transportation will supply 700 locomotives of 4,500 HP and 300 of 6,000 HP. The project is part of a $2.6 billion contract that the Ministry of Railways had awarded in November 2015. The locomotives will start arriving in India at the end of this year GE has subjected them to rigorous testing.

Meanwhile, GE is building its locomotive factory in Marhowra, Bihar. This factory will be used to manufacture the rest of the locomotives from the third quarter of 2018.

GE claims that the new set of locomotives will ""significantly modernise India's rail infrastructure"". GE is also building maintenance sheds at Roza in UP and Gandhidham in Gujarat.

Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran

Inaugurating the first phase of Kochi Metro for commercial operation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said 50 cities in India are ready to implement Metro railway projects in an effort to enhance public transport.

“Foreign investment has been invited in this sector (and) 50 cities in India are ready to implement Metro rail projects,” Modi said in his address.

In line with the government’s “Make in India” vision, Modi said, efforts are being made to promote domestic manufacture of Metro’s rolling stock. The coaches of Kochi Metro reflect the “Make in India” vision, having been manufactured by Alstom of France at their factory near Chennai, he said. He pointed out that they have around 70 per cent Indian component.

The Prime Minister said there is a need to bring about a paradigm shift in urban planning by adopting a people-centric approach and integrating land-use and transport. He also called Kochi Metro’s decision to employ nearly 1,000 women and 23 transgenders “noteworthy”.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan lauded the Centre for its “positive approach’’ towards development and said, “There is no politics in matters of development. It was the stand of the state government that the Prime Minister should inaugurate Kochi Metro.”

Earlier, Modi took the Metro and travelled for six km along with CM Vijayan, Governor P Sathasivam, Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, DMRC’s principal adviser E Sreedharan, Kochi Metro managing director Elias George, and BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan.

While Sreedharan being kept out of the main list of guests for the dais had kicked up a storm in Kerala, leading the state government to request the PMO to invite him, the ‘Metro Man’ drew loud cheers from the audience on Saturday. The 85-year-old, who has been associated with the project since its inception, received a loud applause each time his name was mentioned during the function.

Although the Prime Minister did not make any reference to Sreedharan, Venkaiah Naidu acknowledged his role. “I would like to compliment Sreedharanji for his support and able guidance,” Naidu said.

In his address, Chief Minister Vijayan said no one can forget Sreedharan’s contribution. “His extraordinary leadership had helped speedy completion of the Metro project,’’ he said.

During the inauguration of the Metro station at Palarivattom, the Chief Minister took care to bring Sreedharan to the front row of guests. When the Prime Minister was cutting the ribbon, Vijayan was seen making a place for Sreedharan in the front row of guests on the dais. After the event, the audience were seen jostling to take a selfie with Sreedharan.

Of the 25-km stretch, 13.2 km stretch was inaugurated on Saturday. Commercial services are set to begin on Monday.

278,"No one quite knows which Narendra Modi will turn up to fight for reelection in 2019: the reformist technocrat pledging to create jobs or the tub-thumping populist armed with giveaways. For most of his first term, the Indian prime minister has struck a fair balance between the two, and last month he passed his third anniversary in power with a good growth record and strong poll numbers. But his calculations appeared to change last November, when he tilted toward populism by launching demonetization, a surprise move to scrap two low-denomination banknotes. This has proved to be one of the most disruptive experiments in recent economic history, and one from which Modi’s administration now risks learning all the wrong lessons.

The fact that demonetization has been bad for short-term growth is no longer in doubt. Last week, India released GDP figures for the first quarter of 2017, the period when Modi's demonetization had its largest impact. Over those three months, hundreds of millions of Indians were forced to line up at cash machines and bank counters to replace their old 500-rupee (about $7) and 1000-rupee (about $15) notes, which made up about nine-tenths of the value of all currency in circulation. The crunch hit the poor particularly hard, and brought swaths of commercial activity in India’s cash-dependent economy—and especially in its large semi-legal gray market—to a standstill.

Sure enough, the new data bear this out. From January to March of this year, Indian growth sank to six percent, down from seven percent in the previous quarter. Although high by Western standards, these figures lost India its title as the world’s fastest-growing major economy, pushing China back into first place. They also brought growth over the last twelve months down to its lowest point for three years. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, eager to defend demonetization, blamed other factors, such as weaker global trade performance, for the slowdown. It also pointed to the policy’s potential longer-term benefits, such as higher rates of tax collection. But demonetization’s impact was especially clear in the collapse of spending on construction, which is heavily dependent on informal cash transactions. 

Demonetization has proved to be one of the most disruptive experiments in recent economic history. The problem is that although a drop of a percentage point or so in growth is large, it is not that large. Many economists feared a drop many magnitudes bigger. Now that the worst has worn off, demonetization remains popular. At least at first, Modi justified the measure on anticorruption grounds—by scrapping notes, so the argument went, the government was taking a swipe at black money, or the illicit cash piles thought to be held by everyone from criminals and terrorists to corrupt bureaucrats—and the public appears to have believed him. Yet there is little evidence that any of the criminals suffered more than temporary inconvenience. As their eyes turn toward reelection, the risk is that BJP leaders will have learned to dismiss expert warnings about the cost of populism and press ahead with more of it. 

Understanding why demonetization has been less harmful than feared is therefore important. The World Bank’s most recent India Development Update, published in late May, provides some clues. It shows that the impact of the cash crunch was cushioned by other factors, including a third year of good monsoon rains, which are crucial to agriculture. A recent uptick in global growth helped too, as did higher public spending unrelated to demonetization. And when the demonetization crunch did hit, India’s economy proved more resilient than expected: the remaining cash in the economy circulated more quickly, informal credit was provided to consumers and farmers, and some wealthier people switched to digital payments. 

Put another way, Modi got lucky. But now there is a real risk that he will take more populist measures in the same vein. When his party won a resounding post-demonetization victory in crucial elections in the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh this spring, Modi went on to install the firebrand Hindu cleric Yogi Adityanath as chief minister. Adityanath responded by canceling nearly six billion dollars’ worth of bank loans to farmers. This cancellation started off a chain of events in other states, which some estimate is likely to result in tens of billions of further debt forgiveness, raising pressure on public finances. 

Meanwhile, for the long-term benefits of demonetization to be felt, Modi needs to push what the World Bank report calls “complementary reforms,” including improvements to tax administration and the reduction of complex business barriers, to encourage more of India’s vast informal economy to move into the formal sector. There is a good chance that no such reforms will emerge. So far Modi’s economic achievements are real, but his record on delivering growth-enhancing reforms, especially those that risk upsetting the public, is mixed. Although his grand gesture of demonetization made little sense economically, it has proved enduringly popular, and it appears to have made only a minor dent in the GDP. As he approaches 2019, it is not hard to see the lesson that he might learn.

**Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath turns game-changer to name-changer** 

 ______ 
Change, they say, is a constant in life and it particularly holds true for Uttar Pradesh. More than two months after the people of the state overwhelmingly voted for change and replaced the Samajwadi Party (SP)-led government with one headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the new administration of chief minister Yogi Adityanath is busy changing the names of schemes and projects to stamp its authority.

Last week, the state government decided to rename the civilian terminal of the Indian Air Force (IAF) airport in Gorakhpur after Mahayogi Gorakhnath, the founder of the influential Nath monastic movement.

Chief minister Adityanath — who is a follower of the same movement — is a four-time MP from Gorakhhpur and is the mahant (head priest) of the famous Gorakhnath temple.

The government has also proposed to rename the IAF’s Agra airport after BJP ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

A senior official said the proposal to rename the two terminals have been sent to the Centre after the state cabinet passed such a resolution.

The government also decided to change the name of the Mughalsarai station near Varanasi after Upadhyay. The cabinet has already petitioned the Centre for the change.

Upadhyay, who died while travelling in a train near Mughalsarai in 1968 is a former president of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the parent organisation of the BJP. Mughalsarai is one of the busiest railway stations on the Eastern Railway network.

The plan to rename the airports and railway station comes after the new chief minister ordered officials to drop the prefix ‘Samajwadi’ from the names of all ongoing government schemes and projects. Samajwadi Poorvanchal Expressway, the eight-lane highway to connect Lucknow with Ballia via Azamgarh, has already become Poorvanchal Expressway.

Similarly, Samajwadi Ambulance Service – a pet project of previous chief minister Akhilesh Yadav - has become just Ambulance Service.

The new chief minister, officials say, want the prefix of ‘Samajwadi’ to be replaced with ‘Mukhya Mantri’. The Samajwadi Pension Scheme aimed at senior citizens below the poverty line has already become Mukhya Mantri Pension Scheme. Various other departments are currently looking to change the names of their projects and schemes according to the wishes of the CM.

Similar decisions have been made at the Centre, where the Narendra Modi government faces charges of making cosmetic changes to nomenclature of many schemes started by previous governments. Critics say the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana has been renamed as Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana.

The name-change exercise has brought about both amusement and derision in Uttar Pradesh. Residents have been found to be animatedly speculating which projects could be the next to acquire new identities. If rumours are to be believed, the Lohia Samagra Gram Vikas Yojana named after the late Socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia and the Janeswar Mishra Gram Yojana could be the next to undergo a name change. Mishra, incidentally, was a senior SP leader in his lifetime.

Not many are impressed with the cosmetic changes. “If a government of any political party names schemes and projects after great leaders, the names should not be changed by the government of other party. The political parties should not take a parochial view,” says SK Dwivedi, a political analyst.

But Uttar Pradesh has always had a history of playing with names. When Bahujan Samaj Party’s Mayawati became the chief minister, she too had resorted to large-scale name changes. Among the things she renamed after icons her party associated with were the names of eight districts. Amethi became Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Nagar, Sambhal became Bheem Nagar and Hathras became Mahamaya Nagar.

Once she lost power in 2012, the new SP government got the names changed back. So Amethi once again became Amethi and Hathras reverted to Hathras.

Officials say the latest round of name-change could also be transient. “Wait for a new government and who knows whether the names will stay or not,” pointed out an official who wanted to remain anonymous. Change, after all, is the way of governance in Uttar Pradesh.

**Electric propulsion to usher in new era of satellite launches** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has been working on a new propulsion system that is set to usher in a new era of cost effective satellite launches.Known as electric propulsion (EP) system, this technology converts solar energy into electrical energy which, in turn, is used to change the velocity of a satellite in space. It reduces the use of chemical propellant in a launch vehicle.EP system was first used as a technology demonstrator in Gsat-9 or the South Asia Satellite launched on May 5, which was PM Narendra Modi 's brainchild.Currently, a 2,000-kg Insat/Gsat-class communication satellite carries 800-1,000kg of chemical propellant.This chemical fuel is required for transferring the communication satellite from the geosynchronous transfer orbit (where it is placed by a rocket) to the geostationary orbit (36,000km away from the earth).It also helps in orbit correction and maintaining a satellite on its path for its life duration of 10-12 years.However, the new electric propulsion system reduces the usage of chemical propellant to just 100-200kg as the former serves as the back-up power for correcting the orbit of the spacecraft.""The EP system gives small but accurate thrust to a satellite in its orbit. It can be used for course correction of a satellite during its life duration,"" said a top source in Isro.""The EP system basically converts solar energy into electrical energy and then kinetic energy by generating thrust that propels a satellite. The system just needs a solar panel and components for charging ions,"" he said.With the new system, we can reduce the quantity of chemical propellant carried on a satellite and thus carry a heavier payload to space,"" said Dr K Sivan, director of Thiruvananthapuram-based Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre ""The EP system, also being used by Nasa and Russia, has the capability to eventually lower the cost of launches and can also be used for deep-space and interplanetary missions,"" he said.After the June 5 launch of its 'Baahubali' GSLV Mk III rocket, Isro has acquired the capability to launch a satellite of up to 4 tonnes into the geo orbit.""However, a G-series satellite will be launched from the spaceport in French Guiana, Kourou, as this communication satellite weighs 5.6 tonnes,"" says Tapan Misra , director of Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre.""Another satellite Gsat-20, which is five times more powerful than the one that will be launched from French Guiana, is based on a new technology that reduces its weight to just 3.5 tonnes.This satellite will be launched by our 'Baahubali' GSLV Mk III,"" Misra said.

**RSS enters last leg of BJP deliberations on next President**

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (File Photo) RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (File Photo)

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has joined the last leg of the process of internal deliberations within the ruling party to finalise a candidate for the post of President, ahead of an announcement early next week. With RSS No. 2 Bhaiyyaji Joshi indisposed — he is said to be recovering from a surgery — the task of informal consultations has fallen on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and joint general secretaries Dattatreya Hosabale and Krishna Gopal, sources told The Sunday Express.

Sources did not rule out the possibility of Bhagwat having already held informal talks with a senior BJP leader before he left New Delhi Saturday morning. Bhagwat was in the capital Friday for a scheduled meeting with President Pranab Mukherjee. A fortnight ago, BJP president Amit Shah had met Bhagwat in Nagpur.

Krishna Gopal, the RSS point man for the BJP, was still camping in Delhi after Bhagwat’s departure, sources said. He is likely to touch base with senior BJP leaders like Rajnath Singh, M Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley — these three are in Shah’s committee to consult the Opposition on the next President — as well as Nitin Gadkari and Sushma Swaraj, subject to their availability. Gadkari is travelling abroad and is likely to return late Saturday night. Gopal, sources indicated, would use the Delhi stopover to get a sense of what senior party leaders have in mind.

“The RSS has not given any name. It will have no objection to the name suggested by the party after wider consultations,” a source said. The Sangh hopes that the BJP will arrive at a choice after consulting its top leaders. t As part of this strategy, Shah has already met Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu and Gadkari among others.

Though party leaders remain tightlipped on the informal deliberations, sources indicated that party veteran Murli Manohar Joshi was not out of contention yet. Additionally, at least two sources suggested that Jaitley’s name too was not being ruled out from a list of names being considered in the BJP-RSS deliberations. Names of Sushma Swaraj and Speaker Sumitra Mahajan have been doing the rounds of BJP-RSS circles along with that of Venkaiah Naidu.

A senior RSS functionary denied suggestions that the RSS was trying to steer the course of deliberations regarding the BJP’s choice of Presidential nominee. “All that RSS expects that BJP will sound out the name of the candidate before the announcement after its leadership has completed its internal deliberations,” said a source who had been briefed on the informal consultations between senior BJP leaders and the RSS.

Most party leaders, however, played down these deliberations, suggesting that informal deliberations are only brainstorming sessions, aimed at aligning the thought process behind the selection of the BJP’s nominee with Prime Minister Narendra Modi being the final arbiter.

The BJP appears to be veering towards finalising a candidate early next week. With Shah slated to travel to Gujarat (June 20-21) after his return to the capital on Sunday, a decision on its choice is likely to be announced soon to ensure that formalities are completed before the Prime Minister leaves for his engagements abroad from June 24.

**Tamil Nadu: Rajinikanth meets farmers, assures support for linking rivers** 

 ______ 
Tamil Superstar Rajinikanth on Sunday met a delegation of 16 farmers led by P Ayyakannu and assured them his support for their plea to interlink rivers.

Weeks after asking his fans to “prepare for war,” hinting that he might consider joining politics, the Kabali star on Sunday told the visiting farmers that their plea to link up rivers will be represented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged Rs one crore in this regard.

“Rajini told us that he will take steps to facilitate interlinking rivers, he said first (Peninsular) rivers like Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, Palaru, and Cauvery should be linked,” Ayyakannu said after meeting the top star.

In 2002, Rajinikanth had famously offered Rs one crore towards interlinking Himalayan and Peninsular Rivers after a fast on the Cauvery issue.

“Rajinkanth offered to give us Rs one crore immediately towards river linking, however, we requested him to hand it over to PM Modi for a project in this connection,” the farmer leader who kicked up a storm with his recent multiple forms of protest in Delhi told PTI.

He said,”we wanted Rajinikanth to help make a beginning (pillayar suzhi) for this river link-up effort and he said he will do it.”

The farmer leader said the top star who is shooting for his upcoming flick ‘Kaala’ told them that he will represent the issue to PM Modi “though he did not specifically say that he will personally meet Modi in this regard.”

Ayyakannu, president of National South Indian Rivers Inter-Linking Farmers Association said Rajinikanth assured support to farmers on all issues faced by them.

Rajinikanth while addressing his fans last month had asked them to be ready for war when it comes, asserting the “system is rotten” and that it needs to be changed.

While DMK working president M K Stalin had said that it was Rajinikanth’s wish “whether or not to join politics,” others including pro-Tamil leader Seeman opposed it even as others like BJP welcomed the actor’s remarks.

All India Mahila Congress General Secretary and actress Nagma had said days before Rajini addressed his cadres that the top star will be successful if he chose to come to politics.

She had paired with Rajinikanth in the blockbuster 1995 movie Baasha.

India on Sunday said it looks forward to strengthen its strategic partnership and mutual dialogue with China as the two sides held talks here amid differences over a host of issues including the USD 50 billion CPEC and India’s NSG membership bid. Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh met Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the BRICS foreign ministers’ meeting being held here to finalise the agenda for this year’s BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit to be held in September in China’s Xiamen city. They discussed steps to strengthen strategic relations on the directions laid down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting at Astana recently.

Wang referred to the fruitful and constructive meeting between Xi and Modi on the sidelines of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on June 8-9 at Astana.

In his opening remarks, Singh said that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj wanted to visit Beijing but health and other restrictions did not permit her.

“She is looking forward to meet you,” he said.

Xi and Modi have “laid down directions for us and both the countries to proceed with a path of mutual respect, mutual cooperation on how to improve the existing mechanisms so that more trade, commerce and people to people contacts can take place,” Singh said.

“We both are Asian neighbours, two growing economies, people with ancient relations, we mark the path others to follow. India looks forward to strengthening and deepening its strategic partnership and mutual dialogue with China,” he said, adding he looks forward for many interactions with Wang.

Singh avoided making any reference to differences between the two countries including India’s sovereignty concerns over the controversial China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Beijing blocking India’s entry into the strategic Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) besides a UN ban on Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) leader Masood Azhar.

India last month skipped China’s high profile Belt and Road Forum (BRF) under which CPEC comes.

Beijing also opposed the visit of the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh which it considered as part of Tibet.

Officials said that both the governments are keen to find common ground on the contentious issues.

Singh later attended a banquet hosted by Wang for the Foreign Ministers of BRICS countries.

All the foreign ministers from the BRICS who would also call on Xi.

During the foreign ministers’ meet, China is expected to outline the agenda for this year’s BRICS summit which included efforts to seek common ground against terrorism.

The meeting is a precursor to chain of meetings of BRICS officials including the National Security Advisors (NSAs) meeting to be held later next month ahead of the summit.

China took over the rotating presidency of the BRICS from India after last year’s Goa summit of the group of emerging countries.

China is also expected to outline its proposals for the BRICS summit.

At the Goa summit, India invited heads of the members of BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) excluding Pakistan from the region.

Incidentally, this is the first time that the foreign ministers meeting has been called by a host country holding the BRICS Summit.

that's what i said duh? Modi is using Gorkhas to destabilize WB but if you watch the local debates on bengali channels the BJP spokespersons say that even now that they aren't in favor for the divide. What i feel like is even modi doesn't want the partition but is merely false promising the gorkhas to gain their support. Darjeeling doesn't have the requirements to make a standalone state.

&gt;Why do you think the people are protesting now in 2017?

Because firstly they saw how Telengana has got its own state and they think its possible for Darjeeling too. Also gorkhas have been waiting for an excuse to break out a riot. They got the excuse when mamata forced bengali language there but later withdrawn. But the damage has been done already",2017-06-18 20:27:54

**Modi govt will enact law to ban cow slaughter in India: Subramanian Swamy** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: BJP leader Subramanian Swamy today said the Modi-government will bring in a law banning cow slaughter across the country.""We don't have a law right now, but still we have two years to go... after that five years more... so a law banning cow slaughter, which is in the concurrent list, would be enacted across the country,"" Swamy said at a national meet on 'Bos Indicus: The Glorious Indian Cow' organised by Virat Hindustan Sangam (VHS).VHS is a social outfit formed by Swamy himself.""We have to safeguard the cow for a variety of reasons. Cow represents our mental liberation. So our commitment to safeguard cow is intact,"" he said.The conference was jointly organised by the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Iskcon.He said there would be no dearth of funds to protect the cows or to construct Gaushalas.""We must elevate the status of gau-rakshaks and give them the certificate, so that no one intercepts and kills someone on the roads. All the violence that took place was by the criminals. I think gau-rakhshaks are doing a great service and a new cadre of gau-rakshaks of Hindustan will be created,"" he said.Swamy said, ""The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that eating beef is not an essential part of Islam... and there is no law that can prevent us from legislating that you can not eat beef.""Swamy, a Rajya Sabha member, said it was the Congress government that supported beef export in the form of different subsidies.""The Congress government had given 13-types of subsidies to support beef export and when we came to power, we abolished these subsidies one by one and the tune of beef export has come down significantly,"" Swamy said.Hosts of other dignitaries who took part in the conference also expressed their views on safeguarding cow.Guru Arihant Rishiji, founder of Urjaa World Foundation, announced the launch of an educational awareness campaign to sensitise students about cow protection.""Through our foundation and in association with like minded organisations, we are going to hold camps and awareness campaigns in the schools so that the children are taught the benefits of cow protection and preservation right from the childhood days,"" said Arihant Rishiji.

**Bengaluru Namma Metro's Entire 42-Kilometre Phase-1 Finally Operational** 

 ______ 
Construction for Bengaluru's Namma Metro, which was sanctioned in 2006, began
in 2008.

**Bengaluru: **

President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the last stretch of Bengaluru's Namma
Metro Phase-1 today, connecting the already operational Majestic station to 10
new stations. The metro line inaugurated today is on the North-South corridor,
or the Green Line, which reduces the travel time - from Majestic to
Yelachenahalli - by 40 minutes.

""The journey from East to West should take 53 minutes; North to South will
take 45 minutes. This is half the time taken by other modes of
transportation,"" Mr Siddarahamaiah said in his address. He also said that
Bengaluru is the second city after Delhi to have a full-fledged Metro.

President Mukherjee inaugurated the 12.3 kilometre stretch

at 7.30 pm, in the presence of Mr Siddaramaiah and Urban Development Minister
Venkaiah Naidu. He dedicated the 42 kilometre long Phase-1 of the Namma Metro
to the nation and further praised workers and engineers for finishing the
project in less than 10 years.

""I thank the workers and the engineers who have carved deep into the rocky
Deccan Plateau... You have been able to finish the first phase in less than 10
years. I congratulate you,"" said President Mukherjee.

President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated the last sector of Namma Metro's
Phase-1.

Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu, who had also attended the

inauguration of the Kochi Metro by Prime Minister Narendra Modi

earlier in the day, said that the traffic-choked city of Bengaluru ""really
needs"" the Metro.

""Everybody comes to this city and it has become crowded,"" he said.

Construction for the Namma Metro, which was sanctioned in 2006, began in 2008.

""I was chief minister when it was inaugurated. I am so happy to see this
today. It is a great day for Bengaluru,"" said Union Minister Sadananda Gowda
to NDTV.

Despite the delays and the enormous cost

, it was a proud day for those who contributed to the project. Two junior
engineers, who were attending the inauguration, said that they felt a greater
sense of responsibility. Namma Metro hopes to see half-a-million passengers in
India's IT capital every day.

**Darjeeling unrest: Gorkha Janamukti Morcha slams Modi government, questions BJP MP's absence** 

 ______ 
Highlights GJM today slammed the Modi government for ignoring the Gorkhaland crisis.

They questioned Darjeeling's BJP MP SS Ahluwalia's absence.

Earlier in the day, thousands of GJM protesters today took out huge rallies to observe 'black day'.

The Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) today slammed the Modi government for ignoring the Gorkhaland crisis. They said they were disappointed with Centre's role and questioned Darjeeling's BJP MP SS Ahluwalia's absence. The BJP MP has not visited the city once since the crisis broke out.

Meanwhile, earlier in the day, thousands of GJM protesters today took out huge rallies to observe 'black day' in Darjeeling to protest the death of three its activists in police firing.

The GJM activists marched with the coffins of the three activists who were allegedly shot dead in the police firing in Darjeeling's Singmari on Saturday.

In view of the protest march, the administration had deployed heavy security forces across the city and there were no reports of fresh clashes.

Shouting pro-Gorkhaland slogans, GJM activists started the rally from Chawk Bazar on the Hill Cart Road in Darjeeling.

SILENT MARCH FOR PEACE

Earlier in the morning, many people also took out a silent march demanding peace to be restored in the hills.

In a fresh statement, GJM chief Bimal Gurung said that if police try to stop their movement, it will create trouble. ""We will continue our movement, if police tries to stop us, it will create trouble,"" Bimal Gurung said.

While GJM leader Amar Singh Rai termed the situation in the hills as ""very very volatile"" and claimed a separate state of Gorkhaland is the biggest priority for them and rebuffed any possibility of discussions with the Bengal government.

""The situation is still very volatile. A dialogue has to be opened. But I know that our party will not have a dialogue with the TMC-led state government alone,"" Rai said.

RAJNATH SINGH APPEALS FOR CALM

Home Minister Rajnath Singh has appealed for calm. He said, ""I appeal to the people living in Darjeeling and nearby areas to remain calm and peaceful. Nobody should resort to violence,"" he said, adding that he has spoken to CM Mamata Banerjee, who has apprised him of the situation.

""In democracy like India resorting to violence would never help in finding a solution. Every issue can be resolved through mutual dialogue,"" Rajnath further said.

The Gorkha activists on Sunday blocked roads and staged demonstrations at many places in the Dooars in support of the GJM's call for 12-hour strike in the region as the agitation in the hills spilled onto the plains.

SINGMARI VIOLENCE

The violence in Darjeeling took an ugly turn in Singmari after a massive rally towards Patlebas was halted by the security forces on Saturday afternoon. The GJM's supporters attacked security forces with bricks and bottles in a worst violence since the flare-up on June 8.

Scenes across Darjeeling and nearby Ghoom resembled a battlefield with charred buses and police vehicles, and bricks strewn on the road. At least four vehicles, including three of the police, were torched while eight vehicles were vandalised.

The officials claimed that nearly 36 of the security personnel were injured while trying to contain the violence, and denied that they opened fire at the protesters.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also backed the police claims and accused the GJM of having links with terrorists and insurgent groups in the northeast.

She claimed that there is a ""deep rooted conspiracy"" behind the revival of the Gorkhaland movement.

The GJM announced an indefinite general strike from Monday in the hills encompassing Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts and the Dooars (foothills of the Himalayas covering stretches of Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar district) to oppose the government's purported decision to make study of Bengali language compulsory in state-run schools and to press for a separate state of Gorkhaland.

**Madam President: Why Sushma Swaraj may be an ace in Narendra Modi’s deck of cards** 

 ______ 
Perhaps there are only two things about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision-making that can be forecast with any certainty — he likes to disrupt status quo assumptions with an element of surprise (more shock and awe, really) and all his decrees carry a highly personalised imprint of authority and ownership (there is no community- driven resolution in this government).

If you look at Modi’s key decisions — going public with the surgical strikes, demonetisation or the last minute choice of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh — not one of them was predictable. So the usual caveats apply to any speculation over who the government wants as the next President of India. That said, there is good reason to argue that July will see a madam president in Rashtrapati Bhavan. There are very good political reasons for a contender to emerge from a shortlist of three accomplished women — Sushma Swaraj, Sumitra Mahajan and Draupadi Murmu. Of these there is no question that Swaraj would be the best candidate.

The first reason that makes Swaraj a favourite for the post is that her nomination would easily break Opposition unity. The personal popularity of the external affairs minister — remember how Parliament erupted in warm applause when she returned after her kidney transplant — has ensured she has many friends across the aisle. Regional stalwarts like Mamata Banerjee and Nitish Kumar have already indicated a willingness to consider supporting a consensus candidate if s/he is not a Hindutva hardliner; Swaraj could easily be that nominee.

Though the Modi government will easily win the presidential election if it comes down to one — the small shortfall in numbers could easily come from state parties like YRS Congress or the AIADMK factions — there is a clear political advantage in isolating the Congress within its own camp. If Swaraj is the declared candidate the Congress and the Left are likely to be the only Opposition parties who will still insist on a contest.

To drive a wedge through Opposition unity, especially at a time when there are murmurs of a Mahagatbandhan against Modi for 2019, would fit right in with the BJP’s ‘Congress Mukt Bharat’ blueprint. Since Sonia Gandhi is personally leading the dialogue among 17 non-BJP parties to choose a presidential candidate, pulling leaders away from this informal alliance in support of Swaraj would further weaken the clout of the Gandhi brand. This would perfectly suit Amit Shah and Modi’s preparations for 2019. Swaraj is the only political candidate who could trigger this confusion and divide in the Opposition ranks.

The other good reason for Swaraj to be the frontrunner choice is that she would restore an Abdul Kalam-like ‘People’s President’ reputation to the otherwise stodgy and formal office. As minister she has adopted the persona of mom-in-chief to countless stranded Indians across the globe, by turns warm, firm and funny, as she responds to everything from requests for visas to ‘bring-me-back-home’ pleas from an abused wife. Of course it could be argued that with the prime minister doing most of the heavy-lifting in the foreign policy department Swaraj was compelled to reinvent her role. But this accessible charm has helped her build bipartisan popularity in the public imagination, even among trenchant critics of the government. And it’s not as if her Twitter-friendly avatar diminishes her reputation for efficiency and competence. Bureaucrats who have worked with her swear by her professionalism and her firm articulation has often come to the rescue in delicate or sticky situations. Lastly, if Swaraj is the next president (and supreme commander of the armed forces) we would finally have a woman president who goes beyond the symbolism of her gender. Unlike the little-known Pratibha Patil, the seven-term MP has a successful and long record in politics and would have more than earned the position compared to her female predecessor.

The only factor that could work against Swaraj is her past closeness to LK Advani who has been decisively marginalised by Modi. When Swaraj and her family were drawn into a raging controversy around the IPL and businessman Lalit Modi, it was widely believed that her detractors within the BJP were pleased with her being diminished. But Swaraj hunkered down and kept chipping away within the limitations of her job, deliberately steering clear of all media attention. If she is the BJP’s choice for president it will be the final proof that she has reset her terms with the prime minister. And while the other two women contenders have advantages too, Swaraj as madam president will be an ace in Modi’s House of Cards.

From pre-independence to like the late 60s - The Hindutva movement was basically hardcore ""replace Constitution with Manusmitri"" type. It had little success politically

From lates 60s to late 80s - All these parties coalesced into the Janta Dal which adopted a moderate common agenda. Except for IG's defeat, it had little success as well. Most likely because it was too moderate.

From lates 80s onwards - BJP stirred up the Ram Mandir issue which got it great success politically. Since then, they've had to walk a delicate balance. Too moderate and they lose the core votes and too extreme and they lose swing votes. However, this delicate balance is only publicly...

**Presidential election: Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind is NDA candidate**

In a surprise turn of events, the Bharatiya Janata Party proposed the name of Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind as the NDA candidate for the upcoming Presidential election. Seventy-one-year-old Kovind is a Dalit leader from Kanpur. He was previously elected twice to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh. Kovind used to practice as a lawyer in New Delhi.

Briefing the press after the BJP parliamentary board meeting, Amit Shah said: “Ram Nath Kovind always fought for the betterment of the Dalits and other backward castes.”

Saying that Prime Minister informed Congress president Sonia Gandhi about the NDA’s choice, Shah added that the Congress will discuss the matter internally before spelling out their stand. “Sonia ji told us that she would discuss this within the party and take a call on their next move,” he said.

The Opposition will be meeting on June 22 to decide whether to name a candidate or support the NDA.

Reacting to the development, BJP ally at the Centre, Shiv Sena said the party should have consulted its allies before naming the candidate. Sena MP Sanjay Raut, speaking with news channel NDTV, said: “You made a three-member committee, Amit Shah has met other leaders, then what is the point in all this… They (BJP) have the complete freedom to choose the candidate, it is the biggest party, they lead the NDA, we have trust in the prime minister… BJP should have discussed the name with all the NDA constituents.”

Meanwhile, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, who is at loggerheads with the BJP in Telangana, declared that they would back the NDA candidate.

Earlier today, the BJP parliamentary board met to discuss the names for the upcoming presidential election. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the meeting, and BJP national president Amit Shah and Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj Nitin Gadkari were among those in attendance.

The party had constituted a three-member team to pick a candidate for the election. Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh, who are part of the team, met Opposition leaders to discuss the issue. The BJP has also reached out to their ally at the Centre, Shiv Sena. Opposition parties were, however, noncommittal on the issue as the BJP team did not discuss any names with them. Ruling out support for a candidate with a Hindutva background, the broad consensus among the Opposition is that the candidate must have strong liberal and secular credentials.

Meanwhile, several BJP lawmakers were called to the national capital to act as signatories for the nomination papers. A total of 50 nominators and 50 seconders are required to back a candidate eligible to stand in the election. The election hinges on the Opposition’s decision to field their own candidate, if they fail to arrive at a consensus with the ruling BJP. However, the BJP has the numbers to see its candidate through the election.

**GST to roll out from 1 July, firms get extra time to file returns** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: The GST Council on Sunday paved the way for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) starting 1 July, but gave companies more time to file detailed returns for the first two months of July and August.

“We don’t have the luxury of time to defer implementation of GST. The council decided categorically that it will be implemented from 1 July,” finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters in New Delhi.

The official launch of the GST will be on midnight of 30 June at a function likely to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state chief ministers in Delhi. The GST Council will meet on 30 June to take up any remaining issues, including that of e-waybills.

We don’t have the luxury of time to defer implementation of GST. The council decided categorically that it will be implemented from 1 July- Finance minister Arun Jaitley

The GST Council also cleared anti-profiteering rules that are meant to compel firms to reduce prices of products that benefit from lower GST rates. A standing committee will be set up to screen individual complaints and refer them to the directorate general of safeguards which will investigate the matter. DG-Safeguards will further refer genuine cases to an anti-profiteering authority headed by a retired secretary that will ask the firm to either reimburse the money to consumers or deposit it in a consumer welfare fund, apart from reducing product prices.

“We want to use anti-profiteering rules as a deterrent. We hope we will not be compelled to use it,” Jaitley said.

On the preparedness of the GST Network, Jaitley said that while under the old indirect tax system 8.1 million business entities are registered, so far 6.6 million or 81.1% of business entities have completed their provisional registration on GSTN.

In response to demands from certain sectors, including civil aviation, to defer GST implementation, the council gave an extended period of time for filing detailed tax returns. For the first two months of GST implementation, the tax would be payable based on a simple return (Form GSTR-3B) containing summary of outward and inward supplies, which will be submitted before 20th day of the succeeding month. However, invoice-wise details in regular a GSTR-1 form would have to be filed for the month of July and August by 5 September and 20 September, respectively, the finance ministry said in a statement.

Under GST, transporting goods worth more than Rs50,000 within or outside a state will require securing an e-waybill by prior online registration of the consignment

“No late fees and penalty would be levied for the interim period. This is intended to provide a sense of comfort to the taxpayers and give them an elbow room to attune themselves with the requirements of the changed system,” the finance ministry said.

However, the GST Council could not agree on the contentious issue of rules for e-waybills to check cases of tax evasion and decided that the existing systems of individual states will apply till a consensus is reached on the matter.

Under GST, transporting goods worth more than Rs50,000 within or outside a state will require securing an e-waybill by prior online registration of the consignment.

Talks on e-waybills have been contentious, as some states already have a robust mechanism in place and shifting back to hand bills would cause them revenue loss, said Ansh Bhargava, senior consultant at Taxmann.com. “Deferring the decision to implement the e-way bill system by the GST Council is a welcome step, as it would help the GST Network to understand the nuances involved and come up with a solution that facilitates various industries,” he said.

On the GST rate on lottery, the council decided to tax those run by state governments at 12%. The tax rate will be 28% on private lotteries. The council, on requests from Goa and Rajasthan, which attract a lot of tourists, revised the GST rate on hotels. Earlier, hotels with room tariff above Rs5,000 were to pay 28% and below that at 18%; now, the ceiling has been raised to Rs7,500. Above that tariff, hotels have to pay 28% GST. Integrated GST on shipping vessels will now attract a 5% tax, the council decided.

The GST Council added ice cream, pan masala and tobacco to the existing list of items on which input credit is not available because there is either no input or it is hazardous to health.

Relaxation for filing transaction-wise details in July and August will provide relief to the industry, said Harishanker Subramaniam, national leader, EY India. “The statement that anti-profiteering will be more a deterrent needs to be followed in practice. Consensus on e-waybill is still underway and statement that till then current system will continue makes one wonder whether the state checkposts will continue,” he said.

**BJP names Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind as presidential nominee** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday announced Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind as its presidential candidate. A politically significant choice, Kovind, a senior Dalit leader of the party, belongs to Uttar Pradesh and has been a two-time Rajya Sabha member.

To ensure consensus over his candidature, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the phone with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former prime minister Manmohan Singh to communicate BJP’s choice to them.

BJP president Amit Shah, while holding a press conference on Monday, said that the ruling party has reached out to all its allies, including Shiv Sena, and Kovind will be NDA’s choice for the country’s top post.

“He (Kovind) has been connected with the poor. Having being born in a poor household, with a Dalit background he has managed to reach such a position and today the BJP has decided his name. He will be a candidate for the NDA. Before deciding the name, we have held discussions with various political parties. PM himself spoke to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh. We have informed everyone of the name today,” Shah told reporters, after a meeting of the party’s parliamentary board, its top decision making body.

Kovind, 71, has been the Bihar governor since August 2015. He has been an advocate by profession and has practised both in Delhi high court and Supreme Court. He has served as the president of the Dalit wing of the BJP.

Kovind is likely to file his nomination on 23 June.

“BJP and NDA are hopeful that the fighting for the cause of Dalits and being born in a poor family, he has managed to reach such a high position in public life and that he will be chosen with full consensus,” Shah told reporters, adding that senior leaders will speak to opposition leaders in the coming days to hold discussions over presidential polls.

“Ram Nath Kovind, a farmer’s son, comes from a humble background. He devoted his life to public service &amp; worked for poor &amp; marginalised. With his illustrious background in the legal arena, Kovind’s knowledge and understanding of the Constitution will benefit the nation,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on Twitter after the announcement.

Modi said that as President, Kovind will continue to be a strong voice for the poor, downtrodden and marginalised.

The Congress party refused to comment on the announcement but expressed displeasure over NDA’s nomination of the Presidential candidate without discussing with opposition parties.

“The proposed candidate from the NDA, the Congress party doesn’t want to comment on it at the moment. We had hoped that there would be some names that would be discussed in an attempt to reach consensus before a name was announced. They (BJP) informed leaders and former PM Manmohan Singh of the name that has been decided. We didn’t expect this. The exercise they undertook seems to be a formality,” senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said while speaking to reporters.

The opposition parties are set to meet on 22 June to decide the future course of action.

PARIS: Lockheed Martin signed an agreement with India 's Tata Advanced Systems on Monday to produce F-16 fighter planes in India, pressing ahead with a plan to shift its Fort Worth, Texas plant to win billions of dollars worth of order from the Indian military.India's air force needs hundreds of aircraft to replace its Soviet-era fleet, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's government has said foreign suppliers would have to make the planes in India with a local partner to help build a domestic industrial base and cut outright imports.But Modi's Make-in-India drive runs the risk of conflicting with US President Donald Trump's America First campaign under which he has been pressing for companies to invest in the United States and create jobs instead of setting up factories abroad.In announcing their agreement at the Paris Airshow , Lockheed and Tata said moving the production base to India would still retain jobs in the United States.""F-16 production in India supports thousands of Lockheed Martin and F-16 supplier jobs in the US, creates new manufacturing jobs in India, and positions Indian industry at the center of the most extensive fighter aircraft supply ecosystem in the world,"" a joint statement by the firms said.Sweden's Saab is the other contender to supply the Indian Air Force, offering to make its Gripen fighter in India. It has not yet announced a local partner for the plane which it has pitched as a modern alternative to the F-16s.The announcement comes days before Modi travels to Washington for a first meeting with Trump, scheduled for June. 26. India and the United States have built a close defence relationship in recent years with Washington emerging as among the top three arms suppliers to India, along with Russia and Israel.India will also have the chance to export the F-16 that is flown by air forces around the world, the joint statement said. Some 3,200 of these planes are being flown by 26 countries and the model that is being offered to India will be Block 70, the most modern of all the F-16s.""This unprecedented F-16 production partnership between the world's largest defense contractor and India's premier industrial house provides India the opportunity to produce, operate and export F-16 Block 70 aircraft, the newest and most advanced version of the world's most successful, combat-proven multi-role fighter,"" the statement said.Tata is already building airframe components for the C-130 military transport aircraft.India has not opened formal bidding for the jet order, which is expected to be anything from 100 planes to 250.

**Cattle slaughter crackdown ripples through India’s leather industry** 

 ______

In the backstreets of Agra’s Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community.

The election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred.

Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry.

Last month the Modi government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.

Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts – including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks.

Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.

Social Tensions

Much of India’s meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.

But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.

Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India’s Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100.

The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India’s poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.

Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh government’s move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry’s image.

Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad.

Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.

When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.

“They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread,” says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.

Muqeem’s monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.

Impossible Target

Like meat, India’s leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.

Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.

Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment.

India is one of the world’s top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.

Modi government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion – more than double today’s level – by 2020 as part of a job creation push.

But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production – a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.

Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.

But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.

Companies say the government’s leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.

“There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow,” Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.

“There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.”

There were no comments on the same by the commerce ministry.

In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.

About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.

Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra’s leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.

The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.

Modi’s election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.

When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: “Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.”

In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.

“Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits,” he said in Lucknow, the state capital.

Wider Industry Hit

In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.

Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur’s Small Tanners’ Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur’s leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent.

Qureshi, from the butchers’ organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.

“More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear,” said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism’s social hierarchy once called “untouchables” are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.

Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month – down from 25,000 – because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month’s inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.

Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem’s cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.

He now earns 3,000 rupees – or $47 – a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father’s income supports three sisters and his mother.

“I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here,” he said.

PARIS: Lockheed Martin signed an agreement with India's Tata Advanced Systems on Monday to produce F-16 fighter planes in India, pressing ahead with a plan to shift its Fort Worth, Texas plant to win billions of dollars worth of order from the Indian military.India's Air Forceto replace its Soviet-era fleet, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said foreign suppliers would have to make the planes in India with a local partner to help build a domestic industrial base and cut outright imports.However, PM Modi 's Make-in-India drive runs the risk of conflicting with US President Donald Trump 's America First campaign under which he has been pressing for companies to invest in the United States and create jobs instead of setting up factories abroad.In announcing their agreement at the Paris Airshow, Lockheed and Tata said moving the production base to India would still retain jobs in the United States.""F-16 production in India supports thousands of Lockheed Martin and F-16 supplier jobs in the US, creates new manufacturing jobs in India, and positions Indian industry at the centre of the most extensive fighter aircraft supply ecosystem in the world,"" a joint statement by the firms said.The announcement comes days beforefor a first meeting with Donald Trump, scheduled for June 26. India and the United States have built a close defence relationship in recent years with Washington emerging as among the top three arms suppliers to India, along with Russia and Israel.India will also have the chance to export the F-16 that is flown by air forces around the world, the joint statement said. Some 3,200 of these planes are being flown by 26 countries and the model that is being offered to India will be Block 70, the most modern of all the F-16s.""This unprecedented F-16 production partnership between the world's largest defense contractor and India's premier industrial house provides India the opportunity to produce, operate and export F-16 Block 70 aircraft, the newest and most advanced version of the world's most successful, combat-proven multi-role fighter,"" the statement said.India has not opened formal bidding for the jet order, which is expected to be anything from 100 planes to 250.Sweden's Saab is the other contender to supply the Indian Air Force, offering to make its Gripen fighter in India. It has not yet announced a local partner for the plane which it has pitched as a modern alternative to the F-16s.Tata is already building airframe components for the C-130 military transport aircraft.

Just because I brought in context doesn't mean it is shifting goalpost. Learn to use it wisely. My initial question of how is he better than Murmu hasn't changed.

You said 'knows law' so either Murmu doesn't know law or knows less than him - which of it is true?

You said so ' constitutional expert' - so either Murmu is not an expert of the consitution which would mean she's not worthy to be a Governor in the first place - so did BJP make a mistake in making her the Governor?

&gt;So let's just focus on facts.

OK, let us

Murmu started out as a teacher and then entered into Odisha politics, in the year 1997. She has also worked as a junior assistant in Irrigation Department. She was vice-president of BJP's Scheduled Tribes Morcha, she was elected as MLA twice from the Rairangpur constituency in 2000 and 2009. She served as a minister in Commerce and Transport and subsequently Fisheries and Animal Resources department between 2000 and 2004. She was honoured with Nilakantha Award for being the best MLA of 2007, by Legislative Assembly of Odisha.

Sure, you can take judiciary route and fight cases head on, but judiciary can only amend a few laws, or stall them.

Now don't get me started saying majority of the country is not with NDA, since it got only 31 pc votes, hence got rejected by majority of the people. 69 pc rejected BJP, sure, but at the same time 82 pc rejected Congress and 98 pc rejected the whole of Left. Elections don't work on number of percentage someone gets, so no need to argue on that. 

Modi and BJP in general fills a gap that the country hasn't seen for a while, and was yearning for it. His decisions such as surgical strikes and demonetization, however controversial, makes him appear as a bold statesman, which the country was looking for a while. He filled the gap there. 

Then he travels the world, and raises India's image. Remember his show on Madison Gardens and US Parliament? All his trips did help a little though - India received largest ever FDI inflows. 

When he said ' l am a Hindu nationalist ' he connected with millions who are indeed proud of their culture, and want to display it without shame. These are not hyper nationalist people, or Hindutva goons. These are people like you and me, leading normal lives and doing normal jobs. They just don't want to be ashamed of their culture. As much as we hate it, most of India is Hindu conservative. BJP sells itself best there, as right now there are no other parties in helm who can capture their market. 

Culture, traditions, religion are not bad, and they can coexist with development. The Left needs to understand that when they attack any of the above, they are actually targeting a thing that many hold dear to them. Examples exist in the world of many countries doing good despite culture - Japan, China, Israel, you name it. 

If you want change, you have to understand why majority of people support party at helm. Why it connects with them, and why so many people are comfortable putting their trust in one man. Modi's popularity is beyond any ones limit right now - when you attack the man, you lose. 

Then their are a few things that the govt has indeed done good - bringing gas in many homes for example, which was underreported and cause of win in UP. Maybe broaden your news base sometime. Your social feed and reddit is a bubble, which is quite documented. Try going beyond that.

**Raja Mandala: India, US, and an East-of-Suez moment** 

 ______ 
Trump thinks the US does too much, and Modi thinks India could do a lot more. Trump thinks the US does too much, and Modi thinks India could do a lot more.

Amidst the low expectations surrounding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first face-to-face encounter with President Donald Trump next week in Washington, there is one likely area of convergence the two leaders could explore. It is the prospect of America supporting a larger Indian role in securing the Subcontinent and the Indian Ocean.The shared interest in an Eurasian balance of power and a complementarity between an America shedding its global burdens under domestic pressure and a rising India taking larger responsibilities is not difficult to see. But here is the problem. The Washington establishment bristles at the idea of retrenchment and in Delhi, the strategic community wrings its hands at the thought of going beyond the Subcontinent. But Trump’s policies might compel both to think differently.

The effort to construct an India-US strategic partnership in the last two decades was based on the assumption that the American unipolar moment will endure. America looked at partnering a rising India to sustain US primacy in the Indo-Pacific. Delhi acknowledged American primacy, but was afraid of becoming a “junior” partner. It was concerned that US strategic indulgence towards Pakistan and China — the two main sources of India’s security challenges —may make Washington an unreliable partner.

As a result, the hype about India-US security cooperation never really lived upto its potential. As Trump challenges the traditional assumptions about America’s global role, there is an opportunity, slim though it might be, for Modi to explore a new framework for strategic cooperation with the United States. If Trump believes that an exhausted America must step back from being the first responder to Eurasian crises, Modi has talked up the idea of India as a leading power that must take greater regional and international responsibilities.

During his recent visit to Europe, Modi strongly committed India to the 2015 Paris accord on climate mitigation, after Trump walked out, claiming it imposes too many costs on the US economy. In Washington, though, the PM is unlikely to touch on climate change and other global issues. For “globalism” is a pejorative word in Trump’s lexicon.

But Modi can, and must, explore with Trump the theme of redistributing international security burdens. Trump thinks the US does too much, and Modi thinks India could do a lot more. Trump does not think that America is forever obliged to defend its friends at any cost. He wants the allies to spend more on building their own national defence capabilities or financially compensate America for its heavy lifting. Making it worse, from Trump’s perspective, is the proposition that while riding free on security cover, allies like Germany and Japan have run major trade surpluses with the United States.

For Trump, at least, this present arrangement is unacceptable. Trump may not have the political strength to radically alter the post-war arrangements amidst the intense hostility in Washington. But he may have unleashed a process that could lead to a major restructuring of US alliance burdens in Eurasia in the medium term.

While Trump’s personal style has put off many of America’s allies, they have begun to get the message. Both the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Europe and the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the Pacific have recently talked of the need to take charge of their destiny, and not rely only on America. Some are not waiting. Saudi Arabia, for example, has begun to act on its own in the Gulf and the Middle East.

Where does that leave Delhi? Until now, India has been hesitant to take on a regional security role beyond the Subcontinent. Its talk of “a net security provider” in the Indian Ocean had a nice ring to it; but not enough operational substance, thanks to the deep political and institutional resistance in the Indian establishment.

Twice before when the world beckoned India to take on a larger regional role, Delhi refused. In the aftermath of independence, there was the opportunity of India working with Britain for a regional order under the rubric of the Commonwealth. Although Pandit Nehru accepted the responsibilities of the Raj for the Subcontinent’s security, he was unwilling to back a Commonwealth military framework.

Two decades later, when Britain ended its security commitments “east of the Suez”, the post-Nehru India had neither

the political will, nor the material resources to consider regional security leadership. Its preference was to indulge in vacuous collective security rhetoric. As the Indian Ocean went through multiple convulsions from the 1970s, India has remained a mere bystander.

The US, which replaced Britain as the dominant power in the Indian Ocean in the 1970s, may now be headed to its own “east of Suez” moment, thanks to Trump. This retrenchment is unlikely to be orderly or brief. As America’s domestic politics becomes volatile and its international orientation unpredictable, the transition will be chaotic and extended. For the PM, this might be a good time to begin a conversation on whether and how America might reinforce a larger role for Delhi in the Indian Ocean littoral.

**NSG at forefront of PM Narendra Modi’s three-nation trip**

PTI Photo / PIB (PTI6_15_2017_000222B) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing at the inauguration of the Synthetic Track of the USHA School, via video conference, in New Delhi on Thursday. PTI Photo / PIB (PTI6_15_2017_000222B)

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is headed to the US, Portugal and the Netherlands later this week, New Delhi is looking at securing unequivocal commitment and support from these countries for India’s membership at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). While the US expressed support for India’s membership under the Obama administration, New Delhi wants a declaration and reaffirmation of support from the new administration under President Donald Trump.

“The American administration has indicated that there is no change in their position on India’s application to become a member of the NSG. So, we would like to have a reaffirmation of the support by the administration during the visit,” a top government source told The Indian Express.

With the US government backing out of Paris climate accord, Delhi is keen to get reaffirmation of commitment on NSG. One of India’s key arguments for its NSG membership has been its commitment to abide by the Paris pact.

However, ahead of this year’s NSG plenary session in Bern, heavylifting by the American administration has not been witnessed, unlike last year when the plenary was in Seoul. The then Obama administration had actively engaged with foreign governments and sought support for India’s membership.

India too has maintained a low profile and has not talked up expectations, unlike last time when a diplomatic blitzkrieg was at play in Seoul with Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar present in the South Korean capital while the NSG was discussing India’s application.

Despite India’s entreaties, Beijing had remained unmoved, and insisted on a criteria-based approach for the non-NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) signatory countries. Its position has not changed this time as well, despite several meetings over the last one year.

Some other countries, including Turkey, Switzerland, Mexico and New Zealand, were among those which have stressed on the criteria-based approach, without opposing India’s application outright. So, if last year the government had included Switzerland and Mexico on the Prime Minister’s schedule when he had visited the US in June, this year, sources said, one of the key factors behind making Portugal and the Netherlands as “working visits” by the PM was that both are NSG members.

“They are on board but it is good to establish contact with member countries through a high-level visit at the PM’s level,” a key government functionary said. Portugal had in January expressed its support during Portuguese PM Antonio Costa’s visit to India. The Netherlands has also expressed its support for India’s entry into export-control regimes, including the NSG.

415,"Being a Modi bhakt I understand it is hard for you to understand but let me break it down for you. 

&gt;If you are talking about the recent notification, that benefits Tata as well, and was done because Supreme Court didn't allow either Tata or Adani to raise tariffs in step with coal prices: http://www.livemint.com/Companies/VPQEcCf5oPwMywWHogLnZP/Supreme-Court-tariff-order-reduces-options-for-Adani-Tata-P.html the changes in tariff structures were made on Supreme Court's instructions to CERC:

The Supreme Court order discussed here and the CERC order relate to increasing the tariff. This is a purely contractual matter. What has happened is that these UMPP plants were set up with the idea that [high grade coal would be imported](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/65648/41946-ind-seia.pdf). The Indonesian govt increased the price of coal - Adani and Tata asked the CERC for compensatory tariffs. This went all the way to the SC. The FE and Livemint articles you cited discuss that litigation. 

&gt;So the chain of events is:
&gt; 1.	Tata and Adani sign contract to supply power

Ok

&gt; 2.	Indian coal fizzles out, Indonesian coal is imported

No. The projects required a higher grade of coal that was only available in Indonesia/South Africa
 
&gt; 3.	Indonesia changes duties unilaterally
&gt; 4.	UPA does not allow tariff to be changed

Its not the UPA that decides this. The CERC is the regulator for the electricity industry and the CERC did allow the increase in the tariff relying on the Power Purchase agreement between Adani/Tata and discoms. But the Supreme Court has set aside this decision relying on the terms of the agreement. 

&gt; 5.	SC upholds HC ruling favouring UPA decision BUT offers a way out, asking CERC to co-operate

Which HC decision are you talking about? The High Court was never approached in the compensatory tariff litigation, in fact it is not even the appropriate forum. Are you confused?

&gt; 6.	CERC and BJP change some rules to make the arrangement work again by adjusting customs instead of tariffs
 
Wow. What is that supposed to even mean? 

**The EPW Article**

The EPW article that OP cited deals with something different : customs duty. 

&gt; In August 2016, the Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. [..] According to reliable information received by the authors of this article, the amendment was made to specifically provide Adani Power Limited (APL) an opportunity to claim refunds on customs duty to the tune of ₹500 crore. The APL has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ­materials and consumables—that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately ₹1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ­allowing the APL to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place!

The idea behind a refund on tax is that the govt returns to you taxes that you have paid. Now what Adani is doing is claiming a refund on taxes that it had never paid. 

&gt; The fact of payment of duty on coal has been submitted by the APL to the ­Gujarat High Court in the case Adani Power Limited v Union of India. However, according to documents received by the EPW from a reliable source, ""there has been no tax paid on raw materials and other consumables, which is mandatory as per the SEZ law."" The APL had availed of duty exemptions to the tune of ₹1,000 crore on raw materials and other consumables till the end of March 2015 which have to be paid but had not been paid.


**Why does this mainly benefit Adani?**

The EPW article implies that only Adani has applied for the exemption. Further, only Adani's power plant- Mundra-UMGPP seems to be in an SEZ. Other plants like Coastal Gujarat or Sasan Power are not in SEZs. Further, from the facts in hand it seems that Adani is the only company to have perjured before the court as to having paid taxes while not paying anything.

""This is in sharp contrast to the fact that similar information of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including the expenses of his foreign visits and details of his attendance, is in public domain,"" added Ghadge.""The Maharashtra government is proud of its policy of transparency but when it comes to its own office its hardly transparent. Interestingly, both the GAD and CM's office are under Fadnavis,"" he added.A senior official from chief minister's office told TOI that the CM, other ministers and staffers working in the ministers' offices do not have a system of punching attendance cards. ""There were no records of attendance of the CM, other ministers and their staffers. But they have to work at any point of time. Whenever the CM goes out of town at least two senior officials accompany him for official work,"" he said. The official also added that Fadnavis has a work station at his official residence Varsha, where he convenes meetings.

**India is about to upend the global beef trade** 

 ______ 
India’s paradoxical relationship with beef took a new turn last month, when the environment minister imposed a ban on the sale of cows and buffaloes for slaughter at animal markets.

Cow slaughter has been banned for decades in India because of the cow’s traditional status as a respected creature in Hinduism, the largest religion in India. In some cases, penalties for slaughter can be equivalent to five times the price of the animal slaughtered, or as severe as life in prison.

Despite a huge meat trade in India, estimated at $4 billion annually, only boneless meat of buffalo, goat, sheep and birds are permitted for exports, whereas exports of beef (cow and calf) are prohibited. Some states have extended the ban to bulls and oxen because lawmakers say they should be protected and used for farming. But consecutive droughts have caused farmers strife and they want the ban lifted.

According to a 2016 US Department of Agriculture report, since the late 2000s, India’s exports of beef—in this case, water-buffalo meat, a cheaper, lower-quality meat—have expanded rapidly, making the country the world’s largest beef exporter by 2014, accounting for 20% of trade in the commodity. This growth was predicated on the rising demand for relatively low-cost meat in developing nations, India’s large and mostly untapped water buffalo herd and the emergence of private-sector, export-oriented Indian processors effective in meeting export demand, which is predicted to grow for the next decade.

The ban will undoubtedly have major ramifications for India’s meat-processing trade, as 90% of buffalo purchased for slaughter comes from animal markets. It also will upset the global beef trade by choking off supply. Since India banned the slaughter of its cattle, meat prices have traded higher on concerns of reduced supply. With no resolution in sight, the trend seems likely to persist.

Meanwhile the battle of opinion rages on. Religious activists have become verbally and physically aggressive toward those in possession of cows. Two years ago, a mob killed a man over rumors that his family ate beef, while today, vigilante “cow protectors,” operating with impunity, kill people just for transporting cattle.

Many Indians say the ban has severely affected the lives of cattle farmers and could effectively kill India’s thriving buffalo meat trade and eliminate millions of jobs. There are no buyers for older bulls, and farmers cannot afford recurring maintenance expenses. There are about 190 million cattle in India, and tens of millions go out of the system annually either to die or because they need to be slaughtered. There arises the issue of unwanted cattle crowding towns and cities, disrupting traffic and spreading disease.

The government argues that it’s not an outright beef ban, does not refer to any religious or sacred purposes of the Hindu religion, and is meant to protect agriculture. Legally this might be true, according to a Kerala high court, but in practice the lines are fuzzy. The laws governing cattle slaughter vary greatly from state to state. Although about 18 states have banned it entirely, others allow slaughter with restrictions depending on factors such as age, gender and continued economic viability.

Import demand for Indian beef is growing from nations that are substantially outpacing traditional markets for US exports. The top five export destinations for Indian beef (2013-15) are Vietnam, Malaysia, Egypt, Thailand and Saudi Arabia, while China and Russia could potentially become major markets if trade hurdles could be surmounted.

Indian water buffalo meat exports are not competitive with US beef exports as they don’t meet US quality preferences and animal health regulations. Although US beef suppliers may be able to compete for “high-end” consumer segments in India’s developing-country markets, they likely cannot vie for the faster growing, low-cost segments served by India. Top US beef export destinations are Japan, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong and South Korea.

While many state governments are planning a challenge in court, this will take time. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, viewed as pro-economic growth, ran on a platform that included banning cattle slaughter and imposing a national cow protection law.

In the long term, the ban will likely be reversed or relaxed. For one, not all of India is Hindu. Beef has been an important part of the diet and culture for Christians and Muslims as well as for millions of Indians, such as the Dalits and others of less socially dominant castes. Opponents believe the ban has elements of cultural imperialism, goes against the interests of minority groups, and is a brazen attack on India’s secularism and constitutional values.

In addition, meat-eating habits of Indians have been changing rapidly in the last couple of decades. Chicken, once considered a “dirty bird,” is now the most popular meat. Furthermore, as Indian agriculture adopts more mechanized approaches to farming, the use of oxen will be phased out. But for the immediate term expect supply pressures and global price increases.

**Three Years of Modi Government: 9 PSUs held 30 events, total expense Rs 15 crore**

Smirit Irani at NHAI’s Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas event in Porbandar on June 11. Express Smirit Irani at NHAI’s Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas event in Porbandar on June 11. Express

To celebrate three years of the NDA government as many as nine PSUs hosted 30 events in various parts of Gujarat, which began on May 26 and concluded Sunday. While the PSUs admit that the expense of the events has caused a drain on their event budget allocations, they say that getting a “foothold” in Gujarat is incentive enough. The total expenditure for the events in Gujarat is pegged at Rs 15 crore, according to PSUs. Some PSUs have spent up to Rs 50 lakh per event. The events held across the state were presided over by a union minister each, like Prakash Javdekar, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Smriti Irani, Mansukh Mandaviy and JP Nadda.

A total of 336 events celebrating the three years of the NDA government were held across the country. Out of the 30 events in Gujarat, 18 were hosted by PSUs in the petroleum &amp; natural gas sector and four in power.

A nodal officer from the P&amp;NG says, “For us, Gujarat is of interest simply because it is the number one state in the country with petroleum reserves and so, the events that also give us a platform to network.”

For Javadekar’s Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas (SSSV) event in Mandvi of Surat district, on June 15, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) (Kawas-Surat) gave out a public notification through newspapers ads that stated NTPC has been given the responsibility to organise the event which will see “about 2000-3000 people” participating.

According to official estimates, each PSU that floated tenders for the event management, opened the bid at Rs 45 lakh. Thus, a nodal official from a petroleum sector PSU said, “Each event in Gujarat would have cost a minimum 45 lakh, which includes the cost of printing brochures, standees, backdrop and other promotional material, commissioning a video of the PSU based on the theme of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas to be played at the venue, rent, refreshments, electricity, and other logistical expenses.” By this estimate, the total cost of 30 SSSV events in Gujarat amounts to Rs 15 crore.

Most PSUs say that they view their alignment with the Central government’s celebration as an opportunity for image building.

K L Sharma, regional executive director, Western Region, Airports Authority of India, says, “We know that since we often go in for land acquisitions to build airports, people who lose their lands are not happy and they have a negative view about AAI. The event allowed us to showcase our own work through CSR and other activities. It was more an outreach programme.”

While National Highways Authority of India’s Rajkot Project Implementation Unit (PIU) director refused to give details about the budget of the sammelan it organised in Porbandar for Irani, Rajendra Kumar Bhati, director of NHAI PIU in Gir Somnath said a similar event in Veraval presided over by Irani cost his unit Rs 50 lakh. “The budget was around Rs 50 lakh. Our headquarters had approved it and we shall credit the expenditure under the head directed by our headquarter,” said Bhati.

The Somnath PIU is executing the project of widening Bhavnagar-Veraval section of the National Highway 51 to four lanes. It is a Rs 5,000-crore project to build a concrete road. The Amreli event, also presided over by Irani, was hosted by NTPC “as a publicity initiative” of the company.

“NTPC is organising 56 such sammelans in almost all the states of the country. Our unit organised one sammelan in Amreli as part of the drive. While we don’t have direct operations in Amreli, our customers are there in the district. Through the event, we go some direct publicity,” general manager of the Jhanor-Gandhar gas-based power plant D Basu told The Indian Express. He did not divulge detail of the Amreli expenses, saying they were yet to be calculated.

Some PSUs have said they hosted the events for “outreach” in Guarat, like Tehri HDC India Limited (THDCIL), which held the SSSV event at Patan on June 7, with Hari Chaudhary, MoS, MSME as chief guest.

The undertaking rented plush Utsav Party Plot at Chanasma Road in Patan for the event attended by about 2000 people, according to an official. The official website of THDCIL says, “This initiative will help the Corporation in wider stakeholders’ outreach in Gujarat, where THDCIL is operating two wind power pojects — 50MW at Patan and 63MW at Dwarka.”

Officials of Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which has been given the responsibility to hold six SSSV events in Gujarat — Gandhinagar district, Junagadh City, Kheda, Navsari, Sabarkantha and Narmada — feel that associating with “rare” government events like SSSV helps build a rapport with the state administrative wing. An ONGC official says, “This kind of an event helps us build our own brand image and network with the administrative wing that would otherwise be unknown to us. When we organise such events from the scratch, it acquaints us with some officers who can help us in our own operation.”

According to this official, the central government handed out “Standard Operation Procedure (SOP)” which directed banners, standees, posters and videos that have to be played at the venue and were also given in advance “so that there was no discrepancy”.

“We were told to find a suitable venue, indoors or outdoors, to hold about 2500 people. Every PSU was asked to display their logo and put up standees of achievement and also play a 3-5 minute video highlighting the achievements of the PSU of three years towards the vision of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas”, the official said.

**Ram Nath Kovind as NDA’s presidential candidate: Ear to the ground, eye on 2019** 

 ______ 
Celebrations at Ram Nath Kovind’s family home in Parokh, UP. Vishal Srivastav Celebrations at Ram Nath Kovind’s family home in Parokh, UP. Vishal Srivastav

During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign rally in Gaya on August 9, 2015, Bihar BJP leaders repeatedly referred to Ram Nath Kovind, and his Dalit identity. Kovind, now the BJP’s candidate for President of India, had been declared Governor of Bihar a day earlier.

Before that, the BJP had managed to engineer a rebellion by Nitish Kumar’s handpicked Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, another Dalit, and bring him into the NDA. Manjhi’s induction and Kovind’s appointment was meant to dent the grand alliance of Nitish and Lalu Prasad at the Assembly elections. The move did not work then — but a little less than two years on, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party have decided to use Kovind’s membership of a Dalit community to frustrate the champions of identity politics at the elections to the country’s highest office.

Also, heartburn among the many presidential hopefuls in the BJP notwithstanding, there are few within the party or the larger Sangh Parivar who would publicly object to the move to install a Dalit in Rashtrapati Bhawan.

Cow belt gambit

Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which account for 120 seats in Lok Sabha, have particular significance for the BJP-led NDA. The coalition won 104 of these seats in 2014; however, its limitations were exposed against the combined might of Lalu and Nitish in the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections. And in UP, following the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 2017 Assembly polls, the prospect of the SP and BSP joining hands in 2019 no longer appears unthinkable.

Kovind’s Dalit identity and UP domicile has the potential to loosen Mayawati’s hold on the community in the state. And Lalu and Nitish — both of whom are keen to project themselves as champions of Dalits in Bihar — will find it difficult to oppose the man who is best placed to become the first North Indian Dalit President. The previous Dalit occupant of Rashtrapati Bhawan, K R Narayanan, hailed from the South.

BJP president Amit Shah’s battle-ready election machinery will now roll into every nook and corner of these two politically crucial states to spread the word about a Dalit President from the cow belt. In Bihar, the BJP had delayed its move — this time, Amit Shah has a full two years before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Also read: Kovind had opposed SC status for Dalit Christians, Muslims

Identifying with Dalits

Modi’s dream of spreading the BJP umbrella across the country hinges on deepening its presence among Dalits. This is essential to the party’s long-term plans, given its lack of support among Muslims. The Prime Minister has been trying to weave the BJP into the imagination and consciousness of Dalits by laying claim to the iconography around Dr B R Ambedkar. Between April 2015 and April 2016, the PM attended at least 10 programmes with links to Ambedkar, including a special celebration of the Constitution in Parliament in November 2015.

The Opposition has, however, stressed on incidents such as the death of a Dalit scholar in Hyderabad Central University, flogging of Dalits in Una by cow vigilantes and, after the formation of a BJP government in UP, Thakur-Dalit clashes in Saharanpur, to question the party’s commitment to Dalits.

Sending Kovind to Rashtrapati Bhawan is intended to blunt the Opposition’s argument about the BJP being a party of upper castes. The message is, in fact, likely to travel to Dalits well beyond the cow belt. Any attempt to portray the BJP as anti-Dalit will be politically countered with Kovind’s name.

Enlarging Modi’s pro-poor image

The BJP has also been working hard to craft a pro-poor image for the Prime Minister. And on Monday, Amit Shah spoke about the humble background (garib) of Kovind to solicit support for him. Despite having been a BJP spokesman, a government counsel in the Supreme Court and a Rajya Sabha MP, Kovind has stayed under the public radar. This, in a way, contributes to the imagery of his humble background — which contrasts sharply with that of other prominent Dalit leaders such as BSP supremo Mayawati and former Union Ministers Meira Kumar and Sushil Shinde. In this situation, the BJP hopes, Kovind’s elevation would burnish the Prime Minister’s pro-poor credentials. Expect the BJP to harp on this aspect for the next couple of years.

What remains to be seen

The fact, however, remains that Kovind has never been a mass leader whose personality might be expected to automatically resonate with the mass of people. His appointment as Bihar Governor had surprised most BJP leaders, and his nomination for President has come as a bigger surprise. Spreading the message that is crucial to the BJP will depend significantly on the efficiency of the party’s organisational machinery.

The symbolic significance of elevating a Dalit leader from the cow belt to the highest office is immense. The pulls and pressures of Lutyens’ politics have been set aside. Kovind may or may not be a rubber-stamp Head of State — but given the way he has acted in Patna’s Raj Bhawan, it is unlikely he will be a difficult President.

433,"&gt; If by ""we"", he means Indians in general, then yes

i don' think that's absolutely necessary for that statement to hold. for example, people who refused to give money or support to RSS for their temple movement are definitely benefited from that foresight, so did people who blanked out facebook and twitter feeds of BJP trolls(although that is just mental peace which is an intangible benefit). so are people in states that did not vote for BJP.  

&gt; The sooner we recognize and act on it

In democracy there are more than one ways to act than waiting 5 yrs. Like speaking up for ""others"" when an unjust law is applied or institutions of govt
fail to act. This is a privilege that most of us don't use because  we ""don't want trouble"" the thing is this country has always had trouble one way or another(left or right) the only thing to decide which kind of trouble will you stand up for.


&gt; BJP/Modi are extremely popular (or at least, have enough votes to assure a 2019 election).

perhaps there are people who are overtly, supporting BJP and their voices are heard the loudest. That can be true. what is also true is that there is no really loud opposition to BJP now. That BJP is assured of 2019 election is an assumption.",2017-06-20 11:46:02

**Govt plans to tweak undergraduate courses, combine traditional and modern medicine** 

 ______ 
The government is considering modifying undergraduate curricula to incorporate certain elements of modern medicine into traditional medicine and vice versa in a likely step to promote integrative medicine and research in a big way.

Various departments are working on this idea, including the Medical Council of India (MCI) – the medical education regulator in the country.

A group of secretaries is reported to have suggested the idea of additions in syllabus to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a recent meeting.

However, sources in the Union health ministry say no decision has been taken on this so far.

“Change of syllabus is a long-drawn process. There is a thought at the moment,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity.

“We are in talks with the MCI to see how medical curricula will be cross-cutting, with certain elements of allopathy flown in to Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) courses and of certain AYUSH elements into allopathy courses.”

The move is a part of larger plan to promote holistic wellbeing and make experts from both the systems of medicine open to the idea of working in tandem.

“Around one lakh subcentres in the country will be transformed into wellness centers, and 2500 have already been selected for a pilot,” health minister JP Nadda had said during World Health Day earlier this year.

Last year, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) started ‘The Centre for Integrative Medicine and Research’ which is a state-of-the-art research centre, where top experts from various disciplines of contemporary medicine will collaborate with Yoga and Ayurveda specialists, both for disease treatment, and for preventive healthcare.

“Both the systems can supplement each other well. It is not only about curing a problem but also help deal with the symptoms,” says AYUSH minister Shripad Yesso Naik.

435,"&gt;  At least AAP fights elections on the basis of Educational and Health reforms and not religion and nationalism. 



Lol. 




1. Supporting Hardik Patel and Kanhaiya Kumar. 




2. Evoking dangerous Khalistani sentiments. 




3. Separate manifestos for targeted communities, including Dalits. If this is not pandering to votebanks, I don't know what is.




4. Subsidise everything, but provide the subsidies selectively (No tenants, etc. [Unless AAP won the MCD elections,](http://www.india.com/news/india/mcd-elections-2017-arvind-kejriwal-vows-to-provide-free-water-and-subsidised-electricity-to-delhi-tenants-if-aap-comes-to-power-1987207/) which they didn't). 



5. Surgical strikes. I almost never use the phrase, but AK's behaviour in this case was anti-national. Pro-Pak Twitter handles loved him though. Then, he once tweeted [a Pro-Pak and Anti-India article](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Twitter-explodes-with-rage-after-Arvind-Kejriwal-tweets-anti-India-article/articleshow/54562005.cms) I don't even know why. This was literally undermining our foreign policy stance, and AK's supposedly a CM.




6. Blatant hypocrisy and lack of values: Hugging Lalu, tie-ing up with INC, supporting Chitfund Didi. 



7. Blatant opportunism: Immediately turning on an ascendant BJP and gunning for the PM post rather than focusing on their promised objective of ending corruption in Delhi for 5 years and building a base. 




8. Disgusting tweets unbecoming of a CM. 




9. Sheer ego and arrogance: Claim to be the only moral authority, giving ""Corruption-Free Certificates."" Threw out Yogendra Yadav and anyone even slightly critical of him, soon Kumar Vishwas. 




10. Constant drama and whining. The degree fiasco. All the bullshit of having ""proof"" which he never released on Sheila Dixit, Jaitley, Modi, and numerous others. AK has pioneered blame-game politics, a kind of disgusting hit and run. I hope the defamation cases teach him a lesson. Then, there's the EVM fiasco. This is similar to Mamata's claims of a planned coup a few months earlier, interestingly after a meeting with Kejru.




11. Impressively, single-handedly destroy the hopes of another credible third party rising in the near future. No one will trust it. All the established parties have to do is compare any new entrant to Kejriwal, and voters will flee in droves.



12. Finally, I will let Anna Hazare end my unplanned rant: [Arvind Kejriwal has dashed my hopes: Anna Hazare](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rKOEW4F1htvcGejlPYJfDJ/Arvind-Kejriwal-has-dashed-my-hopes-Anna-Hazare.html)

They all fucking hate Modi. Modi is absolutely murdering Micro and small businesses. Completely business unfriendly policies. Do you know which community had hordes of black money in cash ? Banias did. Modi fuck them in the ass without lube due to DeMo. 

GST is so fucking stupid, 37+ filings per year amongst other stupidities. Is a small businessman supposed to run his business, think of growth or just be obsessed with his statutory filings ? ""In todays India one no longer needs to commit a 'crime' to go to Jail. Simply running a business is enough."" -&gt; literal sentiments of the business class.  

I'll tell you another reason why business-class hates Modi. Earlier VAT/Service tax statements had to be filed quarterly. In a quarter, businesses had the leeway to manipulate stocks/stock statement to commit any kind of tax fraud/business fraud, businesses had the  leeway to book orders in back date if needed. 

Now thanks to GST, they cant do this. Every other week, you have to file returns. They are full and final and changes are difficult to do. And IIRC, you can be penalized if you revise your previous submissions. You know who this hurts ? The business-owning banias. 

Trust me when I say, the fucking business class hates Modi. Your assertion that BJP is a pro-bijiness bania-brahmin party is so asinine absurd stupid and ludicrous. BJP is betraying their old vote-bank - the trader and business class. BJP is killing small and micro businesses. BJP is now basically targetting Congress's votebank - the population of rural areas and the urban poor. why ? Coz That'll allow them to stay in power for a very long time. ? How ? Coz 70% of India's population lives in villages. So many of them are illiterate. If you can get mass support from the rural people, poor people, and illiterate people, they will almost always ensure that you get a brute-force majority, since they dominate by numbers in India.

Please go to villages. Talk to poor, marginalised farmers. Many  were  happy after DeMo. Why ? For a change something happened which fucked the middle-men who made a killing in cash.  farmers were fucking sick and tired of perpetually being fucked over by the middle-men since independence. I know farmers who sold tomatoes for 60-80 paisa per kilo to middle-men who then sold it in cities for 10+ Rs per kg. 

If you live in India, go to the biggest sabji-mandi of your city [the fruit and vegetable wholesale market]. Get a feel of the businesses there and how they are run. Most of the business-owners there deal in cash, earn huge profits, pay very little tax. This is the trader class, the business class. they got fucked by Modi. 

I may be one of the only people who possibly hate Modi more than you do, but frankly you are so delusional and far-off from actual ground reality. Its laughable. 

Get a clue.

***TL;DR*** - Modi/BJP isnt pro-bijiness bania-brahmin party any more. They are becoming pro-poor and targeting Congress's votebank to consolidate their power and stay in power for long time. The urban literate middle class/upper middle class is absolutely irrelevant in the electoral process, because they dont come out to vote -and even the few who do - their numbers are small and irrelevant. Modi/Shah are playing a numbers game and aiming for the vote of the majority that counts - the poor. They are eliminating poverty by making the rich poorer. ",2017-06-20 12:41:54

**Pray For Your Long Life, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tweets Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
Rahul Gandhi is spending his 47th birthday in Italy where he is visiting his
93-year-old grandmother.

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted birthday greetings to political rival
Rahul Gandhi this morning. ""I pray for his long and healthy life,"" the PM
wrote, tagging Mr Gandhi's official account, which hours later, acknowledged
the message.

&gt; Birthday greetings to the Congress Vice President, Shri Rahul Gandhi. I pray
for his long and healthy life. @OfficeOfRG

&gt;

&gt; — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 19, 2017

Mr Gandhi, who turned 47 today,

flew to Italy last week

, declaring that he wanted to spend some time with his 93-year-old
grandmother.

His timing drew criticism - he exited the country at a time of top-gear
political activity which includes the naming of the new President of India. Mr
Gandhi's mother, Sonia Gandhi, who is Congress chief, has been coordinating
the opposition's strategy which is centered on naming a common candidate if
the government's choice is not deemed satisfactory.

PM Modi is meeting today with top BJP leaders

including party chief Amit Shah; sources say the ruling coalition could name
its candidate today.

President Pranab Mukherjee's term expires on July 24. If an election is
necessary, voting will be held on July 17 and the results will be declared on
July 20.

The BJP has tasked three ministers- Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and Rajnath
Singh -with accruing feedback from its allies and opposition parties on who
would be an acceptable candidate.

Mrs Gandhi met with the BJP's representatives on Friday

. So did Left leader Sitaram Yechury.

Mr Gandhi's absence has been used by some critics to bolster their suggestion
that he is not a serious politician. The BJP, however, sardonically said it
was not surprised by his decision to be MIA. ""He visits India in between
vacations,"" said party leader GVL Narasimha Rao last week.

Gujarat's attractiveness accelerated in the 1980s, as subsequent Congress, then BJP, state government deliberately targeted Mumbai's industrialists, and coaxed many to leave Maharashtra for Gujarat with pro-business policies. Modi also has his detractors: smaller businessmen resent his preference for big projects and the industrialists who build them; development workers and opponents also take great pains to point out where development projects have not lived up to Modi's claims.

**GST Launch On June 30 With Special Midnight Session In Parliament** 

 ______ 
Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be launched at midnight on June 30, said
Arun Jaitley.

**New Delhi: **

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that India's biggest tax reform since
Independence, the national Goods and Services Tax or GST,

will be launched at midnight on June 30

.

Mr Jaitley said President Pranab Mukherjee , Prime Minister Narendra Modi and
two of his predecessors, Dr Manmohan Singhand HS Deve Gowda, will be on stage
in the central hall of parliament for the launch. PM Modi will deliver a
speech at the special gathering of parliamentarians. All Chief Ministers will
be invited for the inauguration, said Mr Jaitley, who has repeatedly said that
the GST launch would not be delayed, as requested by some states like

West Bengal

.

""When you go in for reforms, you must never blink. If you blink you get
derailed,"" the Finance Minister said today.

The GST, India's most ambitious tax reform, replaces an unwieldy patchwork of
tariffs and creates a single economic zone with common indirect taxes -
something that neither the European Union nor the United States can boast.

Companies will be allowed to file late returns for the first two months

so that they can adapt to a new online filing system. The strict GST filing
timetable will apply from September.

The government has said GST could add two percentage points to economic
growth.

There will be four tax slabs - 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent.

There have been concerns about the preparedness of the GST Network, the IT
system that marks a technological leap forward for India - it will be driven
by an IT back end that can process up to 5 billion invoices a month. The tax
reform also poses a huge challenge with tax collectors needing to be trained
and companies brought up to speed on a levy that experts say will force them
to overhaul business processes from front to back.

More than 6.5 million businesses have already signed up for the GST, Mr
Jaitley said earlier this week, pointing that that's more than four-fifths of
those already registered to pay India's old business taxes.

With company owners using their personal tax numbers to comply with the GST,
the government expects income tax dodgers to have to come clean. Only around 3
percent of people in India pay income tax.

The GST was proposed by the previous Congress-led government of Dr Manmohan
Singh, but it was stalled by political gridlock over basics of the proposal
including how tax revenue would be collected and divided between the states
and the centre.

Heck, even educated folks here often get into self-flaggelation mode at least a few threads daily. So, this will fly with India.

That's it. Form a Mahaghatbandhan (vote shares add up) and paint BJP as the rich man's party. Challenge the people, where are your Acche Din...And voila. BJP is not such a clear winner.

There was nothing organized about it. The BJP in general and Modi in particular have always been more popular among the middle class and internet users. Even today you'll find it is the case if you make a thread asking our subscribers(99% of which never post here) to vote for party.

The difference is they were vocal about it in 2014 and have mostly been shamed and browbeated into silence now. The only change is in the left wing internet commentary which has become far more vocal, angry and toxic over time, especially post demonetization.",2017-06-20 15:23:46

**Modi government is both pro-farmer and pro-industry: Amit Shah**

BJP President Amit Shah (File) BJP President Amit Shah (File)

BJP president Amit Shah on Friday said the NDA government has proved that it can simultaneously develop villages and industry, and not even the opposition can accuse it of corruption after three years. He was speaking at the inauguration of `Modi Fest’, an exhibition showcasing achievements of three years of Narendra Modi-led government, at Gauss Memorial grounds in Raipur.

“Earlier, it would be asked whether the government of the day was pro-farmers or pro-industry. But the Modi government has proved that it can develop farmers as well as the industry,” Shah said. “This government has completed three years, but neither the media nor the opposition can accuse it of corruption. This is a transparent and decisive government,” Shah said.

The NDA government is aiming to bring not just economic reforms but an economic transformation, he said. “This government has ensured construction of toilets, availability of gas cylinders in the houses of poor. The poor now have bank accounts,” he said.

“Modi has presented a development model based on inclusive growth which aims at taking development to everyone in the society. India has become the fastest growing economy in the world under the Modi-led BJP government,” he said. “Through Yoga day, this government increased the prestige of the country and its traditions,” he said. A befitting reply was given to Pakistan through the surgical strikes, he added.

In UPA government, “every minister considered himself to be the prime minister”, the BJP chief said. “People then waited for long to hear the prime

minister (Manmohan Singh). He had to wait for a call from 10 Janpath (Congress president’s residence) before saying anything,” Shah said, in a jibe at the Congress-led regime.

483,"The problem is people who get pulled into the *Modi*/*BJP* vortex, due to either DeMo, gauraksha, Aadhaar, 'hyper-nationalism', 'welfare schemes' (mostly renamed, but who cares ?) are larger in number and easily swayed than the more rationalist (bhakts : read libtards) bunch. 

BJP has for now played a gamble (possibly to calm the 'middle class') by saying that the center won't waive off farmer loans. But I expect this to change as the 2019 LS election nears.

BJP was never about development (neither was the Congress too). But the set of 'reforms' BJP has made are less about development and more about pushing 'agendas'. They played the poor-rich game very well, played the religion game very well, played the caste game very well, played the nationalism game very well.

487,"RaGa played the ""Suit-Boot ki Sarkar"" rhetoric wayy too early. If he did that on the run up to 2019, BJP would have been rattled. That's how ""India Shining"" lost out, but BJP is now aware of this threat. It won't stick any more. There's also Demonetisation, in which BJP is perceived as being entirely on the sides of the poor and not the rich.




The issue with a Mahathugbandhan is they still have to play nice with each other. Plus, quite a few of the neutrals are on good terms with the BJP, and can simply be made concessions too. Lose a Shiv Sena, gain a TRS, etc.




&gt; We have seen that nobody plays the polarizing game better than BJP - so out-polarizing them on Caste or Religion will not work.




Polarising on rich-poor lines also won't work, because INC is the party linked to corruption and enriching themselves, such as Vadra. Adani-Ambani rhetoric doesn't resonate as much as simply pointing at Vadra, INC's corruption, Lalu's corruption, Didi's chitfund, etc.



&gt; Challenge the people, where are your Acche Din...And voila. 


Say whatever about Amit Shah's and Modi's performance, they are an absolute genius when it comes to electoral politics.
