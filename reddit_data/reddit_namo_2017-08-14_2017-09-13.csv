4,"Because I'm gonna be penalised and possibly thrown in jail if I'm not able to pay till the 20th. They expect me to pay them lakhs of money on threat of penal action and this is the fucking worthless shit site they come up with. 

To top it further, once it started working the special gst Icici bank site for net banking went down. My CA is so overworked he doesn't know what to tell me. The fucker gave me the details on 19th only as he didn't get time and there was a couple of errors in recording gst rates by my accountant.

On top of that banks are closed on 20th so if net banking doesn't go through it's jail on Monday or at least fines.

(Disclaimer: For all Bhakts I'm talking about my accountant modi not the prime minister as any ways his mother is a cow)

And then there is Modi, a genocide accused. 

How people came to have so much hatred for Kejriwal, while increasingly supporting NaMo is a marvelous achievement of PR. ",2017-08-21 14:43:50
6,"&gt; It's upto the parliament to legislate it now. Opposition parties would have wanted SC to take a final call but it didn't. Now BJP gains an upper hand and opposition parties would be damned if they support and damned if they don't.

&gt; All in good for Muslim women and good for BJP politically.

12,"Have you noted one thing about our politics? People vote the leaders based on a reputation factor of some past good deeds associated with that politician. In case of Manmohan Singh, it was his reputation as a finance minister and good work done with *Economic Reforms* of 90s, and with NaMo, it was the very popular *Gujarat Model* of Development. In both cases, the common person was taken for a ride, it would seem that people in politics no longer care for reputation as those in other professions do.",2017-08-30 21:27:24

21,"if i pay 100 rs to an unregistered vendor in july i have to pay 18 rupees to govt in aug which i will get back in sept. but reality is something else. all the money is stuck.

come this 20th i will deposit for the month of aug also.money i couldve used for my business instead now if the reverse charge keeps adding for july aug sept with no reversal i will have to take a loan to finish projects. 

now what compounds the problem is you get a project in july and give to vendor then that gst money needs to be deposited in aug but this gst money youve spent already on raw material. namo namo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

another related problem is that on top of that on advance received you have to deposit the corresponding gst. if i get 100 advance i must deposit 28 to govt in that months return. 

so clients are chindi and are vary of giving that money in the first place. see if im doing work for 1lac and take advance of 50k i have to take advance of 64k and deposit 14k with govt. but client does not want to give so much advance. 

so that amount also i deposit and that also cuts into working capital.
