**$1 Trillion Needed To Achieve 1TW Solar Power Capacity By 2030: French President Emmanuel Macron** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

French President Emmanuel Macron today said $1 trillion will be needed to
achieve one terawatt (TW) of solar power capacity worldwide by 2030.

Speaking alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the founding conference of
the International Solar Alliance (ISA), he said there are financing and
regulation hurdles for achieving the target which need to be cleared by
government, private sector and civil society coming together.

Without any names, he referred to countries quitting the historic Paris
Climate agreement and said that the International Solar Alliance nations came
together to ""deliver complete results"".

The oblique reference was to US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out
of the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 countries in
December 2015 in an effort to curb global greenhouse gas emission and limit
global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius.

In November last year, Syria signed the deal, leaving the United States as the
only country in the world not to support the framework deal to combat
greenhouse gas emissions.

""They (ISA member nations) started to act and to deliver complete results.
They didn't wait, they didn't stop because few countries decided to just leave
the floor and the Paris agreement,"" he said. ""Because they decided it was good
for them, their children and grandchildren and they decided to act and keep
acting.""

President Macron said countries represented at International Solar Alliance
represent three-fourths of the world population. As much as 20-50 per cent of
the population do not have access to power, he said.

The joint goal is to have 1 TW of solar energy by 2030 for which ""we need
$1,000 billion,"" he said.

""We know the hurdles... (there) are financial hurdles, regulations, capacity
hurdles as well. We shall therefore lift every single one of them,"" he said.
""To that effect, it is not enough to look at what governments are doing. We
need a new international deal with the private sector, the international
public sector and the civil society as well.""

""It is common good and it is for the development of all countries,"" he said.

The French president said three primary things need to be done. Firstly,
identify solar energy potential in each country, their projects and financing
requirement. Secondly, mobilise available finance and thirdly to provide a
favourable framework.

International Solar Alliance, he said, will bring member nations financing as
well as share expertise between them.

On financing, he said, the French Development Agency will allocate 700 million
euros in additional spending to its commitment to solar energy by 2022, taking
the total commitment to 1 billion euros.

""But in order to reach the 1,000 billion dollars by 2030, to reach the 1 TW of
solar energy, we need private investors,"" he said, adding that the alliance
will provide a favourable framework.

""It means that we will improve the regulations, the terms in order to support
investments in renewable. It is also about improving public procurement and to
provide efficient policies,"" he said, urging nations to facilitate purchase
and supply of electricity generated from solar energy.

Stating that existing guarantees need to be reviewed, he said, ""We need
appropriate guarantee tools. The existing ones are too expensive and do not
cover all of the risks"".

Lauding India for showing the world the way in scaling up solar power
generation capacity, he said, renewable capacity has within two years gone up
from 39 gigawatt to 63 GW, while that of solar energy has soared by 140 per
cent.

""India proves that it is possible. What you are in the process of succeeding
in doing is being watched by the entire world,"" he said. ""You are attracting
investment, you are supporting them, you are training young people and so this
is what we shall be doing. This is what 121 countries of the alliance in Asia,
Africa, Latin America shall be doing.""

Later he tweeted: ""We make Delhi this weekend the world capital of the sun.
Through our presence, we seal an alliance to make the energy of the sun
accessible to everyone"".

""Countries with the most solar potential are often the most in need of energy,
but only a small share of electricity generation. With ISA Summit, we bring
capabilities closer to needs,"" he said in a tweet.

__ Comments

Seven months ago, when Prime Minister Modi came to Paris, all was done to make
the International Solar Alliance Summit, which was an agreement in principle,
a reality. ""It's done today.""

""We did not come from all continents to deliver additional speeches that will
soon be forgotten. We came to ask the topics on the table and give access to
solar energy in the world,"" he added.

**New Delhi is walking into the China trap** 

 ______ 
It is important for India to engage China but after dealing with the Doklam
crisis so effectively, it doesn’t make sense to concede to China on every
major issue. Photo: Reuters

Just when we thought India was getting its China policy on track, we have
returned to the good old days of doing business with China. Discouraging
government officials from attending a public event, “Thank You India”, being
organized in New Delhi by Tibetans on 1 April 2018, foreign secretary Vijay
Gokhale reportedly wrote to the cabinet secretary that “the proposed period
will be a very sensitive time in the context of India’s relations with China.
Participation by senior leaders or government functionaries, either from the
Central government or state governments, is not desirable, and should be
discouraged.”

In the Maldives, New Delhi decided that asserting its interests would be
tantamount to provoking the Chinese, so we have taken a step back, letting
China roll all over us. And a think tank in Delhi has been asked to postpone
an annual conference just because its deliberations may annoy the Chinese.
China’s response too has been predictable. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, has
resorted to the usual clichés by suggesting that “the Chinese dragon and the
Indian elephant must not fight each other but dance with each other. If China
and India are united, one plus one will not equal two but 11.”

Gokhale was in Beijing last month apparently to “reset” ties, which resulted
in a calendar of government-level interactions potentially leading to a high-
level visit from China. The idea is that last year’s Doklam crisis has put New
Delhi in a precarious position and something significant needs to be done to
assuage Chinese anger. So India has decided to go the extra mile and the Tibet
issue, of course, has become the casualty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is
scheduled to go to Qingdao in China in June for the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization summit meeting and New Delhi might be hoping to make this visit a
success by acquiescing to Chinese sensitivities. It is also likely that India
is trying to acknowledge the fact that China lifted its objections to the
grey-listing of Pakistan with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on terror
financing, by becoming conciliatory on Tibet.

This too is not new. In November 2007, India’s then cabinet secretary had also
sent a note to all the ministers, advising them against attending a function
organized by the Gandhi Peace Foundation on behalf of the Dalai Lama. Then,
too, it was speculated that perhaps then prime minister Manmohan Singh wished
to assuage the concerns of the Indian Communist parties, part of the ruling
coalition, that Indian foreign policy was tilting towards Washington, in order
to send the message that India wanted to preserve the upward trajectory in
Sino-Indian ties. It was also suggested that the government wanted to thank
China for the successful visit to that country of Congress party president
Sonia Gandhi—during it, media reports suggested that China seemed to be taking
a more favourable view of the US-India nuclear deal, then still being
negotiated.

Whatever may have been the motivation, New Delhi’s behaviour then and now
contravened India’s long-held position that the Dalai Lama is a not a mere
political dissident but a spiritual leader widely revered in India. Indeed,
India’s genuflection to Chinese concerns about the Dalai Lama are probably not
even in India’s national interest. The Indian government’s position neither
lived up to the ideals that India often claims it stands for nor did it
clearly enhance India’s strategic interests vis-à-vis China. Such a supine
foreign policy posture by a state that wants to be recognized as a major
global power is not only foolhardy, but increasingly dangerous.

It is important for India to engage China but after dealing with the Doklam
crisis so effectively, it doesn’t make sense to concede to China on every
major issue. After all, India is not only signalling to China but also to its
neighbours and the wider Indo-Pacific, where it claims it wants a larger
strategic profile. The Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) heads of
state were guests at the Republic Day parade and India has taken some baby
steps towards the Quad (with the US, Japan and Australia) in an attempt to
shape the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.

So now to dramatically alter course with the Chinese underscores either a
complete lack of conviction on India’s part or some diplomatic play which
outsiders cannot fathom.

Is the foreign secretary putting down the Tibetans so that Chinese will talk
to him nicely or is New Delhi working on some substantive outcomes during
Modi’s visit in June? Or is it that the Bharatiya Janata Party does not want a
conflagration with the Chinese before the next election in 2019? Or is it that
despite their bombastic statements in the media, the generals are saying
something serious to the government?

By ignoring the China threat over the last two decades, Indian policymakers
have not only exacerbated the trust deficit with China but also made it
virtually impossible to stand up to China even on issues which are vitally
important to India. The power differential between the two has grown at an
alarming rate. Sino-Indian relations, therefore, require deft management, but
pandering to Chinese concerns, real and imagined, did not result in a change
in Chinese behaviour in the past and won’t result in any sort of stabilization
of Sino-Indian relations. It will only entrench Chinese positions at the cost
of India. One hoped that India would learn from its mistakes, but, clearly,
old habits die hard.

**Social injustice**

Written by

BHALCHANDRA MUNGEKAR

There is a common misunderstanding about the reservation policy even among the
educated. (Representational)

The University Grants Commission’s decision, approved by the Ministry of Human
Resource Development, to implement the reservation policy for SCs, STs and
OBCs in teaching positions in the universities by treating department and not
the university as a unit, is socially regressive. It is claimed that the
ministry’s approval is based on the Allahabad High Court direction to
introduce this new formula. Needless to say, this would further and
substantially reduce the number of SC, ST and OBC candidates in the teaching
profession and would defeat the very purpose of the reservation policy.

For historical reasons, the reservation policy was introduced in India in
three areas: Education, employment and the legislatures. The first two aimed
at advancing the material conditions of these historically disprivileged
communities through providing them with access to higher and technical
education, and job opportunities. But most importantly, reservation in
education and employment is more of an anti-caste-based discrimination policy
— that is, in its absence, even the eligible persons of these communities
would be discriminated against on the ground of caste.  
A novel feature of the reservation policy, an Indian version of the
affirmative action policy, is that, unlike many other countries implementing
such a policy, in India population-proportionate quotas have been prescribed
in all the fields, both at the Union and state levels. Thus, 15 and 7.5 per
cent seats have been reserved for the SCs and STs, respectively. Similarly, 27
per cent seats were reserved for the OBC candidates in the Central
universities and educational institutions since 2006 through a constitutional
amendment.

There is a common misunderstanding about the reservation policy even among the
educated, in as much as they think that the provision for reservation for the
SCs and the STs was originally only for 10 years after the commencement of the
Constitution. This is not so. The 10-year provision was only in the respect of
the political reservations and that is why it needs to be extended after every
10 years.

Now, of the reservation in the three areas mentioned above, that in the fields
of education and employment proved to be much more effective in improving the
living conditions of these groups, particularly of the SCs and STs, in
comparison to political reservations. Though faulty in its implementation,
reservations in education created necessary educational skills and
capabilities that enabled these groups to benefit from the job opportunities.
In a highly caste-ridden inegalitarian society, this created in these
communities a strata of teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, top-level
civil servants, poets, writers, and so on. And in this process, access to
higher-technical-professional education proved to be a catalyst agent. The new
formula of implementing reservations in the universities will reverse this
welcome social change.

First, let’s see the reality today. As per the UGC’s annual report for
2016-17, there were a total of 14.7 lakh teachers in colleges and university
departments: 13.08 lakh (89 per cent ) in colleges and 1.62 lakh (9 per cent)
in the universities. The report also gives the category-wise teaching
positions of SCs, STs and the OBCs in the 30 central and 82 state public
universities. The report shows that of the total 31,446 positions of
professors, associate and assistant professors in these universities that were
actually filled in, those belonging to the SCs, STs and OBCs were 9,130, that
is, 29.03 per cent as against their combined reservation of 49.5 per cent. Of
these total 9,130 teaching positions, 7,308 (80 per cent) were assistant
professors; 1,193 (13.06 per cent) associate professors; and barely 629 (6.9
per cent) were of professors. The report does not give the category-wise
information of the teaching staff in the colleges. But one could guess that
the picture would not be substantially different.

Now, if this is a scenario, unsatisfactory as it is, when the quotas meant for
the SCs, STs and the OBCs in the teaching positions are filled in by treating
a university as a unit, what would happen when it is replaced by the
department as a unit? The answer is not too far to seek.

Further, in the days of the privatisation of education, higher-technical-
professional education in particular, disadvantaged sections would primarily
depend on the publicly-funded central and state universities and colleges for
education, as also for jobs. For, private universities and educational
institutions do not implement the reservation policy, nor do they offer
concessions in fees or scholarships. Distressingly, when government privatises
public education institutions, they too withdraw the benefits earlier enjoyed
by these communities. Therefore, thousands of students of these communities
who are enrolling for PG, MPhil and PhD degrees depend only upon the central
and the state universities for getting higher-technical-professional
education, as also for teaching positions. The Congress-led UPA government had
introduced 2,000 annual fellowships in 2005 under the Rajiv Gandhi National
Fellowship for the SC and ST students for doing MPhil and PhD degrees, and a
minimum 15,000 SC and ST students would have obtained their degrees by this
time. I fear their future is bleak. The conditions shall be worse when the
state universities and affiliated colleges shall be induced to follow the
example of the central universities.

In sum, the new formula would play havoc with the SCs, STs, and OBCs as
regards their job prospects in the teaching profession. The Narendra Modi-led
BJP government often invokes Ambedkar. It is therefore imperative, in fact
obligatory, for the government to move the Supreme Court and appeal against
the Allahabad High Court’s direction.

**RS polls: UP BJP fields 3 additional candidates to thwart Opposition’s joint candidature strategy** 

 ______ 
The BJP on Monday fielded three additional candidates for 10 Rajya Sabha seats
in the ongoing biennial elections, presumably to gain more time to finalise
its strategy before March 15 – the last date for withdrawing nomination
papers.

There are 13 candidates, including Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and
Samajwadi Party member Jaya Bachchan, in the fray now. Of these, 11 belong to
the BJP.

The BJP move throws up a major challenge for the opposition, which had joined
hands to support BSP nominee BR Ambedkar in the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls.
“We have 28 extra votes while the BSP – with fewer votes – has fielded its
candidate too. Therefore, we have fielded three extra candidates as part of
our strategy,” said state BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey.

A candidate needs 37 votes to emerge victorious in the 402-member state
assembly. Under these circumstances, the BJP and its allies (with 324 members)
are sure to win eight seats. This will leave 28 additional votes with the
saffron party.

The Samajwadi Party, with 47 members, will emerge as the clear winner in one
seat and still have 10 votes to spare. The BSP, with 19 members, is banking on
support from the Samajwadi Party, Congress (seven), Rashtriya Lok Dal (one)
and NISHAD Party (one) to win.

On the other hand, the BJP – which has the support of three independents –
will still need six more votes. For this, they may have to bank on cross
voting from opposition MLAs. “Considering that we have accorded representation
to all sections of the society (in the government), we are confident of
getting the support we need in the interests of the state,” said Pandey.

Many BJP leaders familiar with the development said the move to field extra
candidates was taken to thwart the opposition’s strategy. The party high
command will take a final decision on its candidates later.

BJP candidate Anil Agarwal, however, appeared confident that he will be able
to mobilise additional votes as the party’s ninth candidate. “We are sure that
many MLAs will vote for us in view of the development work being carried out
under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah
and chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” he said.

Jaitley was the first BJP candidate to file his nomination papers on Monday.
He was followed by more candidates, including Anil Kumar Jain, Kanta Kardam,
Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Harnath Singh Yadav, GVL Narsimha Rao, Anil Agarwal,
Salil Bishnoi, Vidya Sagar Sonkar and Sakal Deep Rajbhar.

**Is Modi aiming for an ally-Mukt BJP in 2019? Just look at these signals** 

 ______ 
The Telugu Desam Party might yet pull back from the brink and its ministers
could yet be part of the BJP-led government at the Centre. But it seems
unlikely. It has raised its protest to decibel levels of shrillness from which
to climb down to baritone sobriety calls for greater musical training than

Chandrababu Naidu

has received.

There are specific, local reasons for the Prime Minister’s disdain for Andhra
Pradesh’s demands for a special package, if not special category status. But
the decision has non-local implications for the BJP’s ability to attract
allies in 2019. These implications are obvious enough and, precisely for that
reason, all the more intriguing.

If the

TDP

walks out of the NDA—it has only walked out of the government, not of the
political alliance, yet—on the ground that the

BJP

has refused to honour its commitment to the alliance, it dissuades potential
allies.

A big difference between the BJP’ style of functioning and the Congress style
of functioning is in how political funding is mobilised. In the BJP, the money
collection is far more centralised, and far more of the money given to the
party actually ends up in the party’s coffers. In the Congress, far more
sticks to the leaders who are supposed to act as conduits than reaches the
party treasurer. The allies, too, benefited from this laissez faire approach
during the UPA. In contrast, the allies have a tougher time in this regard
within the NDA.

The Shiv Sena has already declared that it would not ally with the BJP in
2019. The Akalis got wiped out in alliance with vote-catcher

Modi

. The BJP is intent on raising its own strength in the Rajya Sabha and is not
particularly accommodative of allies in this department, either. So, it really
does not make sense to privilege something as arcane as fiscal discipline over
retaining an ally-friendly image of the party. Yet, the BJP has chosen to do
exactly that, by refusing to implement the reorganisation Act that created a
separate state of Telangana and created payment imperatives benefitting Andhra
Pradesh.

The vandalization of Periyar statues in Tamil Nadu, in the wake of a local BJP
leader’s outburst of Hindu fervour against Periyar, defines the BJP as being
beyond the Dravidian pale. Rajnikant’s party is most likely to be a non-
starter, like that of Kamalaahaasan (that is how the name is written in Tamil
and Malayalam and makes sense as a conjugation that means Laxmi’s husband or
Vishnu).

Modi’s visit to Karunanidhi seemed to suggest the awareness that the BJP would
need to make up in the South the seats it is bound to lose in the North, as
compared to the 2014 results. The resounding victory of the rebel AIADMK
faction in the RK Nagar by-election, with its candidate Dinakaran carrying out
an anti-BJP campaign, has probably persuaded Modi that it is futile to try to
undo the anti-North Indian passions unleashed by the Supreme Court’s move to
ban Jallikattu.

The disdain for Naidu — Modi did not return a call — suggests not so much the
confidence that Modi can replace Naidu with an eager

Jagan Reddy

, whose massive wealth makes him vulnerable to CBI and Enforcement Directorate
investigations, as readiness to dispense with allies in 2019.

The BJP in 2019 is not the BJP of 2014. It runs governments in 22 states, on
its own or with allies. It has a major presence in most states, except in
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Further growth calls for displacing potential
allies. The BJP has replaced the Congress in Tripura and Orissa as the
principal challenger, and the Left in Bengal. It sees an opening in Andhra
Pradesh. Modi probably calculates that his development charisma will appeal
more to voters disappointed by Chandrababu Naidu than the YSR Congress
scurrying forever from corruption charges. Which means that the BJP will try
to make its own way in Andhra Pradesh, without an ally, come 2019.

There is another reason why allies might not be such a good thing for Modi. If
the BJP fails to win a majority on its own in 2019, Modi would be seen to have
suffered a setback, not climbed to greater heights of glory. That would be so
un-Modiesque, besides having the potential to encourage challengers to Modi’s
leadership to come out of the woodwork, claiming to be more acceptable to
allies than the imperious Narendra Modi.

It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that the humiliation of Naidu indicates
a BJP decision to go all out for a solitary victory in 2019, riding on Modi’s
popularity.

35,"&gt; Would the CPI-M workers help out a rally of farmers waving BMS/RSS flags?

Ordinary Mumbaikars, dabbawallahs, schoolkids, Shiv Sena, MNS, Muslims, Gurudwaras, student organizations etc are all helping the rally despite red flags.

Will even BJP help out a rally of farmers waving BKS/RSS flags? Check this out:

&gt; After he became the chief minister of the state, Modi decided to hike electricity prices. In July 2003, the BKS asked farmers to not pay electricity bills and in September 2003, more than 50,000 farmers took part in a rally at Gandhinagar where the BKS leader, Prafull Senjalia criticised Modi for following “in the footsteps of Pandit Nehru by giving more importance to industry rather than agriculture”. Three months later, the BKS was forced to vacate its state-level office in the MLAs’ quarters. This movement, that was supported by Keshubhai Patel, took a dramatic turn when a senior BKS leader, Laljibhai Patel, went on a fast. On January 23, 2004, the RSS sent a team of five mediators. But the BKS leaders were so bitter that they opposed the BJP in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and attacked the Modi government on farmers’ suicides. The BKS also initiated several agitations to protest the establishment of Special Economic Zones and Special Investment Regions (SIRs), which, it argued, benefited industrialists at the expense of farmers. The organisation protested against the Mandal-Becharaji SIR arguing that the project would divert 50,880 ha of fertile land for the use of industrial concerns such as Maruti.

&gt; Today, the BKS faces a dilemma: Remaining aloof from the kisan agitation would mean losing credibility among the farmers, but the BKS cannot overtly attack the RSS-supported BJP governments. Can it play the role of a mediator?

.

&gt; There is a potential contradiction between the Sangh Parivar’s attempt at representing society through peasant and labour unions and Hindutva politics that relies only on some sections of society (the upper caste urban middle class) while ignoring social divisions in the name of an all-encompassing Hindu nation.

**People know EVM is ‘Each Vote for Modi’, says Guj I&amp;B Minister**

Gujarat Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja. (Source: Facebook)

Praising Election Commission and Information &amp;amp; Broadcast department of
Gujarat government for its work on voters’ awareness, Minister of State for
Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja on Monday said that people have brought BJP into power
identifying EVM as “Each Vote for Modi”. Speaking in the Gujarat Assembly
while putting forward the budgetary demands of Information &amp;amp; Broadcast
Department to the tune of Rs 126 crore in the House, Jadeja said that at a
time when many people conspire to defame Gujarat in the country and even
abroad, the Information Department is spreading message of development against
the politics of appeasement.

“If Gujarat has become number one in the country, the Information department
has made lot of efforts in it,” Jadeja said. “It is Kaliyug, and in Kaliyug it
is not enough only to be good, but it is equally important to do good work and
show it (to the public),” he added.

“Our Information department took up many works for creating voters’ awareness,
to increase voting percentage…and we have got results also. Voters have become
aware. Information department has a role in increasing voters’ awareness…
Election results have come and after the results, all these (members of
Opposition Congress) have raised objections related to EVM and VVPAT. (But)
people have identified EVM as Each Vote for Modi and brought BJP into power.”
Jadeja said.

“Perhaps its budget could be small, but I&amp;amp;B department has played a very
important role in creating brand image of Gujarat prevailing in the entire
country,” Jadeja added. Jadeja also accused Congress of resorting to the
politics of appeasement. Referring to Gujarat assembly elections, he said that
Congress leaders were visiting temples just to get photographed. “However,
people of Gujarat identified you,” Jadeja said adding, that BJP believes in
“conserving culture and therefore the people of Gujarat had been giving us
power for the past 22 years”.

**Opinion: I Walked With Farmers Through Mumbai Today. What I Found.** 

 ______ 
Before I started for the rally, I had applied a generous amount of sunscreen
on my face, my mother had given me a bottle of ORS to sip through the walk so
the scorching summer sun did not induce a migraine. I had my head and face
covered with a scarf and my Nike running shoes in place.

My urban, sheltered and privileged life was an embarrassment when I walked
with Ujjwala, who had left her month-old baby at home to march with her fellow
villagers. I notice a drop of sweat escaping from her hairline and offer her
my ORS. She laughs and tells me in Marathi

_""Nako tai, aamhala savay aahe, tumhi ghya _

(Thanks, sister, but we are used to it. You need it)"". Ujjwala has a bag full
of documents, mostly applications to the local bank. Some are letters in
Marathi from her local

_panchayat_

, some from the village registrar. Ujjwala delivered a baby last month, she
was admitted to the local hospital right after for acute anaemia, the baby was
born underweight. She could not breastfeed her child because nutritious food
is a luxury, three meals are a struggle and some days, her family survives on
a single meal of rice and jaggery.

Last year, her small farm was destroyed by pests leaving them with almost no
produce. The loan that her family took from a cooperative in the district has
been unpaid. She asks me if I know anybody in the government to whom she can
hand over the applications. I try to offer her some money.

_""Nako re tai""_

, she refuses. ""Your money won't even last us a month, only the government can
help, get them to listen to us if you can.'

Walking right behind her are a bunch of young boys in red caps and flags
raising slogans of

_""Lal salaam""_

. They are singing a Dilip Kumar song from

_""Mazdoor""_

. They laugh when one of them misses a line and switch to a Marathi song.

At least 35,000 farmers reached Mumbai's Azad Maidan after a grueling 180-km,
six-day march from Nashik

I ask them if they are members of the Left. They smile and ask me if I work
for a TV channel. Another says ""

_Didi, hum log shetkari log hai_

(we are farmers)"".

It is late evening and some of the marchers have decided to stop by a tea
stall on the road. The eldest of the group is presumably in his late 70s, a
volunteer offers him tea in a disposable cup. Somebody passes on a packet of
Parle-G biscuits. I ask him if it was important for him to walk all the way to
Mumbai from Nasik. He says he is not alone, most of his friends are walking
along. ""Last night my legs froze."" He tells me about his diabetes which made
it difficult for him, every two hours he had to look around for a toilet. ""The
people of your city are good people, they gave us food and water. We are here
to ask your leaders sitting in

_Mantralaya_

(the government headquarters) to be good to us. They have forced us to walk
all the way from our villages to your city. Even if I fall sick, I will know
that I did something for my son and his children. Sitting at home is not going
to pay our loans.""

He is hopeful, he shows me his Aadhaar card and that of his grandson. ""I have
all the documents, everything they need. I have got all papers, I have got my
voting card too.""

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray, who is
President of the youth wing of the party, is already addressing the rally.
""They look at your red flags, I look at the red colour of your blood,"" he
tells them, taking potshots at the BJP whose leaders have called the rally a
Leftist attempt to destabilize the government - of which his party is a
member.

MNS leader Raj Thackeray who is almost slipping into political oblivion also
makes an appearance. I ask those around me if they would want the Shiv Sena or
Congress to support their rally and they tell me the colour of the flag does
not matter. ""Manmohan Singh was the son a farmer, Modi claims to be one of us,
he rose from being a

_chai-wala_

. How does it matter what party they belong if they have no concern for us?
Anyone who can bail us out of this distress will be our saviour.""

The Maharashtra farmers were demanding loan waivers and updated minimum
support price after unseasonal rain destroyed crops

WhatsApp groups and Twitter handles have been activated. Messages float around
that the protests have been planned by Maoists to destabilize the BJP led
government in the state and at the centre. Poonam Mahajan, BJP MP from Mumbai,
tells reporters outside parliament that the farmers protests have been
propelled by ""urban Maoists"". If not for the ongoing parliament session,
Poonam could have been in Mumbai and seen the blistered feet of the farmers
who passed by her constituency.

In June last year, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced
a complete loan waiver for farmers following which state peasant leaders had
called off their protests. The farm waiver was to benefit 89 lakh farmers, but
the organisers of the march told the media that only 31 lakh farmers have
benefited from what they described as an arbitrary loan waiver procedure.

Since January this year, senior leaders from the NCP, Congress and the Shiv
Sena have been talking of a statewide agitation. The All India Kisan Sabha of
the CPI(M) started mobilizing farmers across the state systematically with
cadres visiting villages and taking details of loans from villagers.

As I write this the farmers, have called off their protest. Chief Minister
Fadnavis has agreed to meet all their demands in a move that was much
anticipated. The state along with the country will face elections next year.
The voices of the farmers are now in our living rooms, not just those of
Mumbaikars but through the country - everyone has been watching the agonizing
march of distress.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said his government was ""sensitive and
positive"" towards the demands of the farmers

The WhatsApp forwards on development that used to pour in were replaced by
images of tired faces and scarred feet. This movement has the potential to
galvanise and give voice to an agrarian distress that has overtaken the
country. For now, Modi and Fadnavis have managed to change the direction of
the wind. But the peasants from Maharashtra have given a direction to the rest
of the country, made it clear that they will no longer be taken for granted.

Promises have been made in the past and it is very likely that now, like then
they will not be fulfilled. It is also likely that compromises could be made
by leaders, that the farmers could return to our indifferent city the next
year to serve us another reminder of their pain. But the stories of suffering,
of farmer suicides which were restricted to an insignificant corner of a
newspaper, has now become a talking point. It brings with it a much needed
reassurance that the country has not lost its soul.

**PSU banks: maximum government, minimum governance** 

 ______ 
The PNB fraud has turned into a public sector versus private sector debate.
Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint

The PNB fraud has turned into a public sector versus private sector debate. A
few weeks ago, a public sector bank chairman made a forceful point: it is
private companies that have defrauded the banks, it is the private sector who
are the “wilful defaulters”. That doesn’t speak very highly of governance
standards in the private sector. Others have pointed to the Barings debacle,
where a rogue trader brought down the bank, and to the financial crisis,
brought about entirely by private sector banks. A group of 60 economists have
cautioned against using the scam as a pretext for privatizing banks. Since the
government in any case has to bail out a failing bank, even a private sector
one, why privatize the profits if the losses have to be socialized, so goes
the argument.

The bank chairman makes a valid point. Banks may be in the public sector, but
they lend mostly to the private sector and most of their funds go to large
companies. The PSU banks are no bastions of socialism—on the contrary, they
serve the private sector and help the development of capitalism in the
country. Where’s the contradiction between public sector banks and the private
sector then?

After Independence, the nascent Indian private sector needed the crutches of
the state to survive and grow. The Bombay Plan, drawn up by Indian
industrialists, wanted a strong government role in the economy to support the
private sector.

Bank nationalization was instrumental in expanding the footprint of Indian
capital to the hinterland, mobilizing savings for industry and infrastructure
and creating a large middle class through its lending to small enterprises and
big farmers. Indeed, it provided the economic base for the ascent to power of
the middle castes. To be sure, it also did some lending to the poorer
sections, but that was merely a useful safety valve against rural discontent.

In short, the public sector in a developing country is a tool to help develop
capitalism. One very interesting view was that of Amadeo Bordiga, one of the
founders of the Communist Party of Italy, who viewed the Soviet Union as a
society in transition to capitalism. Later events, well after his death,
proved him absolutely right.

But there’s hardly any doubt, after the unearthing of massive amounts of
hidden bad debts and the latest scams in nationalized banks, that something
has gone very wrong in their working. After all, they have no shortage of
skewed incentives. While some of the private banks, too, have seen high bad
debts, they pale in comparison to the NPAs of public sector banks. The
question we need to ask is: is state ownership of banks still needed for
supporting the Indian economy?

In a paper, _Government Guarantees and Bank Vulnerability during a Crisis:
Evidence from an Emerging Market_ authors Viral Acharya, currently deputy
governor at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Nirupama Kulkarni studied the
performance of Indian banks during the financial crisis of 2007-09. They
found, strangely enough, that the more vulnerable PSU banks performed the best
during the crisis.

The authors wrote, “We attribute this to the presence of government guarantees
which enabled more vulnerable state-owned banks to grow their deposit base by
increasing their deposit rates. While they also increased loan advances, they
did so at cheaper rates and especially to politically important sectors. Ex-
post, these loan advances have been associated with greater non-performance
and restructuring of assets, thus sowing the seeds of an economic slowdown in
investments in India.” Simply put, they attribute the subsequent investment
slowdown to the actions of the more vulnerable PSU banks.

Indian capitalism is now strong enough to do without PSU banks. They have
outlived their purpose. These banks have become the weak underbelly of Indian
banking, a risk to the entire system. Thanks to technology, the cost of
financial inclusion has come down drastically and a host of small banks,
payment banks and companies, telecom companies and micro-finance institutions
can easily do the job. The RBI can ensure that private sector banks fulfil any
targets seen to be socially desirable.

That means financial inclusion is not the problem. The real reason for the
political resistance to bank privatization lies not in the state-owned banks
funding social programmes, but in their being an inexhaustible source of
patronage and crony capitalism.

The PNB fraud provides an opening for the Modi government to walk the talk on
its “minimum government, maximum governance” promise. Will it seize the
opportunity?

**Sonia Gandhi to host dinner for oppostion parties today** 

 ______ 
UPA chairperson

Sonia Gandhi

will host a dinner today which is likely to be attended by leaders of 17
opposition parties, amid talk of forging a broader front against the BJP-led
NDA ahead of the 2019 general elections.

According to

Congress

sources, leaders of Andhra Pradesh's ruling

Telugu Desam Party

, which recently pulled out its ministers in the Modi government but continues
to be a constituent of the NDA, BJD, and the TRS have not been invited. The
BJD and TRS rule Odisha and

Telangana

respectively.

They said former chief ministers of Jharkhand Babulal Marandi of Jharkhand
Vikas Morcha and Hemant Soren (JMM) will attend the dinner, along with former
Bihar chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha chief

Jitan Ram Manjhi

, who recently quit the NDA and joined forces with

Lalu Prasad

's RJD, which is an ally of the Congress.

Lalu's son and Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly Tejashwi Yadav is
also likely to attend, but there was no immediate confirmation.

Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay, DMK's Kanimozhi and Ram Gopal
Yadav of the

Samajwadi Party

are likely to be present, and so would be leaders of left parties - CPI-M's

Sitaram Yechury

and CPI's D Raja. Leaders of other parties like JD-S and Kerala Congress,
Indian Union Muslim League, Revolutionary Socialist Party and RLD are also
likely to attend.

Sources said while BSP has been invited, its leader Mayawati may not send a
representative as her party has aligned with JD-S for the Karnataka polls
likely in April/March this year.

The dinner being hosted at the 10, Janpath residence of Sonia Gandhi, is
expected to set the tone for opposition unity in the run up to the next
general elections.

Sonia Gandhi has called for opposition unity and said parties should set aside
their minor differences to get together in the larger interest of keeping the
BJP out of power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

However, a comment from him declaring that his government doesn't support the politicizing of this issue or / and  any caste / religion based issue, would go a long way in achieving the ultimate goal. He should reassure us citizens that the law of the land would be strictly followed and should condemn mob violence / vigilante justice in the name of religion / caste.

**Less than half of budgeted allocation for Modicare released: Parl panel report** 

 ______ 
The Modi government has released less than half of the budgeted allocation for
health insurance of poor families in fiscal 2017-18, even as it promised to
step up coverage with the proposed launch of what is called the world’s
largest government healthcare programme.

The revenue allocation of Rs 975 crore for the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana
(RSBY) was reduced to Rs 565 crore and, as the year progressed, the actual
release was just Rs 450 crore — less than half of the budget estimate,
according to a parliamentary panel’s report.

“Funds as central share of premium under RSBY of approximately Rs 450 crore
were only released for such states that submitted their proposal during the
year 2017-18,” said the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family
Welfare in its report.

As for the reason for reducing the budgeted allocation, the panel quoted the
department of health and family welfare, saying: “This ministry had moved a
proposal for another scheme with enhanced cover of Rs 1 lakh per family.

“However, this proposal is still pending with the cabinet. Therefore, such
states that were waiting for the new scheme to be launched did not submit any
proposal and meanwhile stopped implementation of RSBY.”

Even the amount of Rs 25 crore allocated for capital purposes in 2017-18 for
setting up office premises for the proposed scheme with enhanced cover of Rs 1
lakh remained unutilised during the period as the cabinet approval for the
scheme remained pending. The money was surrendered.

The RSBY provided a limited coverage of only Rs 30,000 and there was a
proposal to increase it to Rs 1 lakh. While the government had difficulties in
implementing the healthcare scheme, it announced the launch a bigger
healthcare programme in its Union Budget for 2018-19 last month.

The proposed National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), which would subsume
RSBY, would cover 10 crore poor and vulnerable families, and the coverage is
further enhanced to Rs 5 lakh per family per year.

However, the Parliamentary Standing Committee has warned of possible failures.

The committee reported that the enrolment in RSBY was quite low. “Only 57 per
cent of eligible are enrolled and less than 12% of the eligible persons got
their hospitalisation covered through RSBY.”

Citing a comprehensive review of various studies on RSBY, the panel said that
in a majority of states (eight out of 14) there was an increase in out-of-
pocket expenditure related to RSBY, while only two of 14 studies showed
reduction in expenditure.

It further noted that many states have opted out of RSBY in favour of state-
run schemes. “The government should form a committee to analyse the failures
of RSBY and ensure that inadequacies plaguing the operation and implementation
of RSBY are not repeated.”

The panel observed that the new scheme is just a modification of the earlier
one as more than half of the target beneficiaries proposed to be covered under
the NHPS were already covered under existing government supported schemes.

“What would indeed have been a step forward is if it covered out-patient
treatment as well, but that is lacking,” said the Parliamentary panel.

# TB in India: PM Narendra Modi plans to eradicate disease 5 years ahead of
global deadline, here’s how

## TB in India: Prime Minister Narendra has time to time shown concern over
diseases and stressed on the need to build a healthy society.

**TB in India:** Tuberculosis (TB) is considered as one of the deadliest diseases in India, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global TB Report pointing to 28 lakh tuberculosis cases in 2015 and 4.8 lakh deaths due to the disease during the corresponding period.

**TB in India:** Prime Minister Narendra has time to time shown concern over diseases and stressed on the need to build a healthy society. Tuberculosis (TB) is considered as one of the deadliest diseases in India, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global TB Report pointing to 28 lakh tuberculosis cases in 2015 and 4.8 lakh deaths due to the disease during the corresponding period.

Aiming to eradicate this deadly disease by 2025, PM Modi today launched a
campaign during the Delhi End-TB summit in the national capital. PM Modi said
that a target has been set to end TB globally by 2030 and stressed the
government has set an aim to eradicate it from India five years ahead by 2025.

As ambitious as it may sound, eradicating the disease will be no mean task. A
study shows India has the most number of child deaths due to tuberculosis.
Over 55,000 children died from the disease in the country in 2015, according
to a PTI report.

However, PM Modi has now offered a blueprint and emphasised on a few areas to
achieve the optimum result. **Here are the major takeaways from TB-free India
Campaign launched by PM Modi:**

  * Noting that efforts to check tuberculosis have to yield desired results, PM Modi underlined that state governments need to play a pivotal in eliminating the disease. PM Modi said he has written to all chief ministers to join this mission. He also said that it would boost the spirit of cooperative federalism
  * PM Modi also shared a few thoughts for doctors. He said that front-line TB physicians and workers can make a major contribution in this direction. Noting that poor were the worst affected by this communicable diseases in the country, PM Modi said every step taken towards eradicating the disease is directly connected to their lives.
  * TB-free India Campaign, which was today launched by PM Modi, will take forward the activities under the National Strategic Plan for TB Elimination.
  * The Prime Minister also stressed on monitoring the situation and altering the approach. “Rate and coverage of immunisation need to be increased,” PM Modi said.

The summit was organised by the Union Ministry of Health along with the WHO
and the Stop TB Partnership. The summit would set the stage for the September
2018 United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB, where for the first time, TB
would be discussed in the UN General Assembly at the Heads of State level.

75,"I would like to make a few points here:

1. The no reservations in minority schools policy is in compliance with the Constitution. And a Supreme Court Bench examined it and said:
[""The State has the power to frame regulations, which are reasonable and do not impinge upon the basic character of the minority institutions. To provide for and enforce any regulation which will practically defeat this purpose would have to be avoided.”] (http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/State-cannot-compel-minority-institutions-to-implement-quota-Supreme-Court/article16197708.ece)

This follows from a 2002 ruling by an **11 judge constitution bench headed by the chief justice** in the case of  TMA Pai vs the State of Karnataka. It says:
**It was held that the state government and universities cannot regulate the admission policy of unaided educational institutions run by linguistic and religious minorities, but state government and universities can specify academic qualification for students and make rules and regulations for maintaining academic standards. **

So it is not something Sonia Gandhi thought up in her sleep. 

2. Minority here, unlike a lot of people online and in Reddit, understand as (read Christian and Muslim), refers to all kinds of minorities including linguistic. So, a Gujarati Vidya Mandir in Tamil Nadu would be a minority institution because it is run by a linguistic minority.

3. The story here fails to explain why it is bad to have minority schools. Most of India's best privately owned schools and colleges are minority run ( and yes, here I mean Christian run).

4. It is funny when the RW demand that minority institutions be brought under reservations, while elsewhere they are fighting against reservations.

5. It has been 4 years of Modi government and I fail to understand why Sonia Gandhi sectarian project is still being run. Why doesn't Narendra ""sabka-vikas"" Modi make changes to it?

6. This is a terrible article, using alarmist tactics. While it says the number of minority schools has doubled from 11 in 2012 to 22 in 2018, and claim that 30% of schools there now are minority institutions, it doesn't clarify if these schools have come up additionally or as it existing schools re-tagging themselves as minority institutions. This is important because it doesn't give the reader a clear picture of how serious this change in numbers is.



",2018-03-13 16:23:49
76,"Most convincing explanation I have come across about Modi's victory, Trump, brexit etc is that it is a reaction against globalisation. 

What globalisation has done is that it gave rise to an economic class with fluid identify independent of their locations. This minority drowned the voice of majority in media and gave a false sense of trends. Trump's victory is a good example of how media and liberals got it wrong about emotional pulse of the majority. 

The majority are dependent on land and have strong identity based on nationalism and regionalism and religion. Liberal media ignored it.  

In India too what bjp think tank has done is tapped into identity politics. Hence they used nationalism, religionious identity etc. 

The thing about Modi is that he is corporate friendly, hence he got a lot of media support. If you look at the biggest beneficiary of Modi's accent to power is the tech companies, corporations and media they control. They have pretty much fully controlled every mainstream narrative. And killed every opposition. 

Modi and BJP is unstoppable as of now. And they are in a way what our times demand. Maybe in future this will be seen upon as dark times. Like how history viewed emergency days in India. 

But what will happen eventually is that there will be a huge inequality that will become pronounced and the identity politics that BJP is now playing will come back and bite them. Because India is a diverse country. And it has more than one identity. That is why if you listen closely you can hear talks in fringes about states especially in the south mooting ideas of saperating from the India and forming a union of south states. Though it's a stupid idea it is showing what is wrong with the current policy and politics. 

India is a large country. Change here ought to be slow. We are like an elephant and if the elephant is made to run faster than what its body weight can do it will fall. 

So BJP or Congress or left or whoever is coming to power ought to look carefully when formulating policy and tinkering with the cultural sensitivity of this highly diverse country of ours. 

BJP is trying to redefine what it means to be an Indian and India will revolt against that if they push too hard.

**BJP IT cell founder Prodyut Bora quits party; attacks PM Modi, Amit Shah's style** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Disillusioned by the ""subversion of democratic tradition in the
government and party"", young BJP leader from Assam

Prodyut Bora

, who founded the highly successful IT cell of the party, resigned from
National Executive Committee and primary membership of the party.

He said that the party was no more a party with a difference. ""Madness has
gripped the party. The desire to win at any cost has destroyed the very ethos
of the party. This is not the party I joined in 2004,"" Bora told ET on
Wednesday after sending his resignation letter to

BJP president

Amit Shah.

He said he had lost hope from the BJP under its present dispensation. ""The
country needs a different kind of political alternative. It is up to the BJP
to be that or people will look for choices,"" Bora said, adding that though he
had got offers from the

Assam

units of

Congress

, AAP and the AGP to join, he was not keen to take them up.

In his four-page detailed resignation letter, 40-year-old Bora raised
uncomfortable questions about the style of functioning of

Narendra Modi

and Shah. He said that Modi had ""damaged the democratic tradition of the
country where the PM is the first among equals in the Cabinet system and not
the first among unequals.""

In the scathing letter, the Assam leader also questioned Shah about his
""highly individualised/centralised style of decision-making"" that was making
many party office bearers feel highly dis-empowered. ""In any organisation, the
style of the leader is quickly copied by those below him/her. What I am seeing
in the party ,at least in my state, is the flowering of junior Amit Shahs,
with a tenth of your capability and ten times your arrogance,"" Bora wrote.

The young leader also could not come to terms with the fact that Assam was not
only on the periphery cartographically but also in the mind space of the
national leadership. He wondered what had happened to Modi’s election promise
of sending the Bangladeshi illegal migrants packing from Assam.

**BJP IT cell official Sanjay Rathod tweets: Kill JNU students, professors; later deletes it** 

 ______ 
By:

Express News Service

| Rajkot |

Updated: March 9, 2016 1:38 am

Sanjay Rathod’s controversial tweet.

A DAY after Delhi Police arrested a man for allegedly offering a bounty on
JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, a BJP worker in Gujarat suggested that the
protesting students and their teachers should be shot to “close the chapter”.

Sanjay Rathod, IT cell convener of BJP’s Junagadh unit, posted on his Twitter
handle Tuesday: “Shoot Anti National JNU students &amp;amp; Proff and close the
chapter. But the problem is that Our Govt doesn’t allow to kill Dogs
#WakeUpIndia”.

At 3.30 am, two minutes before his “shoot” suggestion, Rathod, 35, posted,
“#Wake-UpIndia or it will be too late. There are big forces who want to break
India. They are funding #antinationals &amp;amp; paid media.”

In yet another tweet in Hindi, he wrote, “Kal se jo 10 aatankwadi Gujarat mein
ghuse hain, unme se kaun kiska beta, beti, bahu hai, yeh abhi se tay kar lein,
baad mein Ishrat Jahan ki tarah lafda nahin chahiye. (Decide son, daughter,
daughter-in-law among the 10 terrorists who infiltrated Gujarat yesterday.
Don’t want an affair like Ishrat Jahan later.)”

Confirming that the Twitter handle in question — @Sanjay-Vis — is his account
and that he stood by his posts, Rathod told The Indian Express, “As a BJP
member, I am supposed to express my opinion and counter views opposed to my
party. I am also supposed to support those supporting our line of thinking.”

****

Rathod’s Twitter account has more than 1.19 lakh followers, including
Gujarat’s Minister of State for Science and Technology, Govind Patel. His
profile identifies him as a “social media expert, director Gujarati TV, IT
cell convener of Junagadh BJP and a member of state working committee of the
Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM). He works as a public relations consultant
with an agency in Rajkot.

His homepage has two photographs of him with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In
one photograph, Modi is seen handing over a certificate to Rathod. He was
felicitated by the state government in August 2012 for “creating the largest
Facebook group in India, having more than 16 lakh members”. He had also
conducted a poll on the site, which won the largest number of votes in favour
of Modi.

Rathod has studied till Class XII, and although his tweets appear in English
and Hindi, he says he is not fluent in either language. “I don’t know much
English. A couple of other persons also operate the Twitter account on my
behalf. The tweet (about JNU) has been posted by one of them. But I stand by
it,” Rathod said. Speaking with The Indian Express, he offered to delete the
tweets “if it had hurt anybody’s sentiment”.

The tweets were found deleted a few minutes later.

Kanu Bhalala, president of Junagadh district unit of BJP, confirmed that
Rathod was convener of IT cell, but added that he was “not active of late”.

Kanhaiya and a few other JNU students were booked by Delhi Police for sedition
after they allegedly raised “anti-India” slogans last month. While Kanhaiya is
out on bail, two others, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, are in judicial
custody. Opposition parties have opposed the police action.

**Exclusive: The 'Silver Touch' Behind BJP's Online Dominance?** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

While the BJP (and its famed IT cell) have always strenuously denied the
suggestion that its social media dominance is powered by paid supporters,
increasingly, evidence is mounting of a party - and government - taking
recourse to cut-and-paste tweets and manufactured trends to firefight crises
and counter its critics.

One such trend offers a clue as to how these efforts are possibly being
financed using government funds.

On August 31, as criticism mounted that Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar had
failed to contain the violence after Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim
Singh was convicted of rape, the hashtag #HaryanaWithKhattar began to trend.

In what has become a familiar modus operandi, the trend was powered by a
cluster of pro-BJP handles furiously posting the same tweets. For instance:

Among those helping to amplify this trend was Bhargav Jani, whose handle is
@bhargavjanibjp. He posted 63 tweets (that originated on other accounts) in 92
minutes with the #HaryanaForKhattar hashtag.

On LinkedIn, Bhargav Jani describes himself as a ""Social Media Manager for
BJP"" since January 2009. (He is also followed by the Prime Minister on
Twitter). He also says he is ""Manager in Social Media in Silver Touch
Technologies Ltd"" from December 2016.

In a more detailed CV, uploaded on LinkedIn, Mr Jani stresses that he is a
""Social Media Performer"" who tweets ""at least 30 times a day while engaging
influencers to increase the followership (sic) of client's social media
profiles"".

Here's how gamed or manufactured hashhtags work: a person puts out, say, a
dozen templated tweets and a hashtag to go with it; at a pre-determined time,
a cluster of pro-BJP handles begin to release the same tweets with the hashtag
and at a high intensity.

On its website, Bhargav Jani's employer, Silver Touch, appears to be an old
and reputed IT firm, established in 1992 in Ahmedabad. It has a roster of
private clients like Reliance Industries, Adani Group, Hitachi, Nirma Group.

Government contracts, however, appear to be a mainstay. The firm's list of
business includes the maintenance of 46 government websites, as well as
developing apps for the Ministry of External Affairs, the President of India
and many others.

The government of Gujarat appears to be a big client - we counted at least 17
departments who have availed of Silver Touch's services.

In its draft red herring prospectus filed before the National Stock Exchange
of India in September this year, it said that it got 53% of work from
government contracts worth approximately 62.5 crores rupees in the last
financial year.

It is unclear, however, why the company would hire someone like Bhargav Jani.
There is no mention on its website that it does any social media work.

And yet, Bhargav Jani is not the only employee of Silver Touch actively
amplifying pro-BJP and pro-government trends on social media. One of its
directors, Himanshu Jain, described as being with the company since 2010,
tweets under the moniker HeMan NAMO (@HimanshuJainOn).

Himanshu Jain, too, is followed by Prime Minister Modi on Twitter and his
timeline is full of tweets in support of the BJP or Centre or attacking its
rivals, and little else.

For instance, he was part of gamed hashtags like #ModiTransformsIndia on the
day when PM Modi delivered a lengthy speech defending the economy and
#LiesAgainstShah to counter the backlash after reports on the finances of Jay
Shah, son of BJP president Amit Shah.

We called Silver Touch, posing as representatives of a senior minister from
Uttar Pradesh, keen to engage the services of someone like Bhargav Jani to
boost the fictional minister's profile on Twitter and counter his critics.

The receptionist transferred us to a man identified as Mr Jaiswal, who
described himself as Bhargav Jani's senior.

Mr Jaiswal said our request would fall under what Silver Touch offers as
""online reputation management"".

""If somebody does a negative comment, how do you react to the negative
comment, how to neutralise it. It comes under online reputation communication.
So we do all these activities,"" he said.

He said they had a dedicated team for this purpose.

Mr Jaiswal then passed us on to a Mr Manoj (no surname offered), who we were
told is senior to him.

Mr Manoj confirmed that Silver Touch did do ""reputation work"" for Haryana, and
it could be replicated for us. ""It will be managed,"" he said.

He said the contract could be signed with the government allowing the minister
to avail of their ""reputation management"" services.

The contract, however, he said will not mention ""reputation management"". ""We
can't write all this,"" he said. ""We would write it as content writing or
something else.""

He explained how other government departments have gone about it in the past.

backbone) agency is responsible for all the procurement and consultancy

ministries across states and across country. Your request can be routed
through NIC, it will be faster. You just have to identify a sponsor department
and then when you approach NIC SI, it will weigh the scope of work.""

Mr Manoj said the company only does BJP work.

A detailed questionnaire sent to Silver Touch initially elicited no response.

When we visited the offices of Silver Touch in Delhi, no one was willing to
talk on camera.

When we called one of their executives, Sanjay Roy, on the phone for an
official comment, he flatly denied the company provided social media services,
saying ""We are an IT services firm and have nothing to do with social media
promotions.""

When we cited examples of Himanshu Jain and Bhargav Jani's Twitter activity,
he told us they were tweeting in their private capacity.

Both of them tweet during office hours: for example on October 10, a Tuesday,
Himanshu Jain posted 59 pro-BJP and pro-Modi tweets between 10 am and 6 pm.

Bhargav Jani promoted #SwacchtaHiSeva during working hours on September 15, a
Friday, tweeting 55 times with the hashtag between 3 pm and 4pm.

As for our conversations with Mr Jaiswal and Mr Manoj, where they explicitly
offered Silver Touch's social media services with instructions on how to mask
the services we would be availing, Mr Roy said he ""does not know anything
about that"".

At their Ahmedabad offices, our reporter was initially given the run around,
directed to meet an executive named Minesh Doshi, but then later told he was
not in office. Instead, he was asked to meet someone who introduced himself as
a human resources executive. He told us that Silver Touch does do social media
work, and that Mr Jani is an employee of Silver Touch, but that he could not
tell us anything further.

Silver Touch finally responded 10 days later, via an email from Himanshu Jain,
the director referred to earlier in this report. He said ""Bhargav Jani works
in Ahmedabad office of our company. His social media activities as are not
part of his official work. I have been tweeting in personal capacity. I have
never been paid for my tweets. We have never worked for any political party on
any issue. We have no BJP IT cell persons. We are primarily a software and
System Integration company.""

Himanshu Jain didn't address the questions pertaining to what his company
official told us over the phone when we called Silver Touch posing as
potential BJP clients, nor did he specify what exactly Bhargav Jani does for
Silver Touch.

The BJP IT cell head, Amit Malviya denied any knowledge of Silver Touch
Technologies and Bhargav Jani. In an email response, he wrote, ""I don't know
of anyone with the name Bhargav Jani who works with BJP IT Cell in any formal
or contractual capacity, either in the national team or any of the state
teams. He may be a volunteer though. I also don't know of Silver Touch
Technologies. Have never met any of their representatives. So the question of
BJP IT department having any kind of dealing with them doesn't arise.""

He also said that the BJP's IT department doesn't engage with PR agencies to
drive its social media engagements, adding ""Is Bhargav Jani, who ever he is,
not entitled to his political views irrespective of his employment status?""

__ Comments

Responding to our report, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said the state
government has not hired any PR agency.

OP Dhankad, the state's Agriculture Minister, however said, ""In the age of
social media, if government takes help of IT professionals, what is wrong in
it? TV channels also hire professionals for increasing their TRPs"".

**PM Narendra Modi launches campaign to eradicate TB from India by 2025** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Launching the TB-free

India

campaign to eradicate the disease by 2025, Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

today said global efforts to eliminate

tuberculosis

have not been successful and stressed on changing the approach to achieve the
goal.

Modi said the government is moving ahead with the principle of ""treat every TB
patient best at the very first opportunity"" and is roping in the private
sector as well.

He also called for multi-sectoral engagement and participation of all stake-
holders at every level to create ""TB-free village, panchayat, district and
state"", noting that frontline TB physicians and workers can make a major
contribution in this direction.

Holding that tuberculosis impacts lives, economy and the future of a nation,
he said it is the poor who are worst affected by this communicable disease and
every step taken towards eradicating tuberculosis is directly connected to
their lives.

The prime minister was speaking at the inauguration of the Delhi End-TB Summit
here.

Modi said the World Health Organisation had declared tuberculosis an emergency
25 years ago and since then several countries have made efforts to eliminate
the disease.

""But the ground reality still remains that we have not been successful in
curbing tuberculosis yet. If something doesn't yield desired results even
after 10-20 years, then we need to change our approach and analyse the work
done, which could help in finding new paths,"" Modi said.

He launched the TB-free India campaign to take the activities under the
National Strategic Plan for TB Elimination forward in a mission mode for
eradicating the disease by 2025.

""A target has been set to end TB globally by 2030. I would like to announce
that we have set aim to eradicate it from India five years ahead, by 2025,""
Modi said.

State governments have a major role to play in elimination of TB from India,
the prime minister said, adding he has written to all chief ministers to join
this mission.

The National Strategic Plan to eradicate TB by 2025 is operational and the
government is constantly increasing budget for the schemes to counter the
disease, he said.

""The government has made a provision of spending USD 100 million per annum for
providing nutrition support to the patients suffering from disease,"" he said.

Listing out the steps taken by his government, Modi said flagship programmes
like Swachch Bharat Abhiyan and providing LGP connections for a ""smokeless
kitchen"" under Ujjwala Bharat Yojana will also reduce the dangers of
contracting the disease.

The prime minister said his government's thrust has been on technology and
innovation in this field to better the drugs, diagnosis and treatment of the
disease and to boost research, India TB Research Consortium has also been set
up.

Noting that TB is associated with social stigma and patients often hesitate to
reveal their disease, Modi said that willpower is very critical to win over
the disease.

Targeting the previous governments, Modi said the immunisation programme has
been going on for the last 30-35 years and despite this the country could not
achieve the target of a complete coverage till 2014.

""The pace of the immunisation coverage earlier was inching ahead by just a
percent. Had we continued at with the same pace, it would have taken us
another 40 years to achieve the target.

""However, in the last 3 to 3.5 per years it has increased by 6 per cent and by
the next year, we will achieve 90 per cent immunisation coverage,"" he said

He also urged the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to expand the ambit of
research of traditional medicine in curing tuberculosis and share the results
with other nations.

Leaders from across the globe have converged in the national capital for the
summit, hosted by the Union Ministry of Health along with the WHO and the Stop
TB Partnership.

TB was responsible for 1.7 million deaths in 2016, despite most cases being
curable while over 10 million people contract TB every year.

The summit would set the stage for the September 2018

United Nations

High-Level Meeting on TB, where for the first time, TB would be discussed in
the

UN General Assembly

at the Heads of State level.

**RBI discontinues Letters of Undertaking, Letters of Comfort as trade credits** 

 ______ 
In what could be a fallout of the Nirav Modi-led

PNB scam

, the

Reserve Bank of India

has discontinued LoUs and Letters of Comfort as instruments of trade credits.

The RBI, in a circular, said,""it has been decided to discontinue the practice
of issuance of LoUs/ LoCs for Trade Credits for imports into India by AD
Category –I banks with immediate effect.""

The Reserve

Bank of India

said that the Letters of Credit will be continued to be issued ""subject to
compliance with the provisions contained in Department of Banking Regulation
Master Circular on 'Guarantees and Co-acceptances' dated July 1, 2015.""

The move could potentially hit the importers who rely on letters of
undertaking and letters of comfort to get bank guarantees for their imports.

In the aftermath of the Nirav Modi-led Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, some
banks clamped down on the issue of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs).

According to a

report in the Economic Times

, banks like Canara bank, IDBI bank and Axis bank either cut back or stopped
issuing LoUs for certain categories after the

PNB

made it public that

Nirav Modi

along with some employees of the bank pulled off a Rs 12,600 crore scam.

While the pushback against globalization can explain Trump and Brexit, its logic works in the exact opposite direction in India.

At the same time globalization has allowed a steady flow of migrants from these poor countries into the developed countries. 

In effect the rich, the people with the capital have profited enormously. At the same time, the poor and the middle class has seen its jobs either offshored to India and other poor countries, or seen an increase in competition due to the migrants. 

The people in the west are pissed with globalization as it has not benefited them. They therefore are backing anyone who opposes the pro-globalization status quo. 

Contrary to them, India has gained enormously. We have seen a lot of western money flow into our economy. The entire startup boom we saw the past few years was due to such money. Not just that, we have also benefited from the jobs being offshored to us. Behemoths like TCS and Infosys are built entirely around such offshored jobs.

It is telling the facts, if they sound alarmist to you is because the situation is.

Out of these, 11 schools opted for the minority status after the Supreme Court in 2012 ruled that the minority schools are not bound to reserve 25% of their seats in entry level classes under Right to Education (RTE) Act.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/why-schools-in-chandigarh-are-running-after-minority-status/story-Wv2kNLPDZPQCcvKlELy3TP.html

&gt;It is funny when the RW demand that minority institutions be brought under reservations, while elsewhere they are fighting against reservations.

So they are saying either all institutes be equal or all students be? How is that wrong?

&gt;The story here fails to explain why it is bad to have minority schools.

""The story"" does not say it is bad to have minority schools, but wants equality in education for majority run and minority run schools. I know asking for equality for majority is a big no-no for some people.

&gt;This follows from a 2002 ruling

Conveniently ignoring the 2005 PA Inamdar V State Of Maharashtra

""In the opinion of S.B. Sinha, J, minority educational institutions do not have a higher right in terms of Article 30(1); the rights of minorities and non-minorities are equal. What is conferred by Article 30(1) of the Constitution is “cert**ain additional protection” with the object of bringing the minorities on the same platform as that of non-minorities, so that the minorities are protected by establishing and administering educational institutions for the benefit of their own community, whether based on religion or language.** It is clear that as between minority and non-minority educational institutions, the distinction made by Article 30(1) in the fundamental rights conferred by Article 19(1)(g) has been termed by the majority as “special right” while in the opinion of S.B.Sinha, J, it is not a right but an “additional protection”.

https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1390531/?big=2&amp;formInput=minority%20educational%20institutions

So when SC rules in Aug 2005 that Minority and non-minority institutes be given equal rights, the UPA govt spearheaded a Constitution Ammendment(104th) bill in Dec 2005. and getting it passed as 93rd ammendment.

https://indiankanoon.org/doc/762374/

The 93rd  constitutional amendments brought about in 2006, basically states ""minority educational institutions, both aided and unaided, are exempted from enforcement of the reservation policy of the state in respect of backward class of citizens"".

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/minority-colleges-cant-be-asked-to-reserve-seats-for-backward-classes/articleshow/61566627.cms

So yes it was something that Sonia Gandhi brought upon by even ammending constitution.

&gt;The no reservations in minority schools policy is in compliance with the Constitution

This statement is so funny. Bring about a sectarian constitutional ammendment, with explicit exeptions; then laugh when SC says that yes this is written in the constitution.

&gt;It has been 4 years of Modi government and I fail to understand why Sonia Gandhi sectarian project is still being run. Why doesn't Narendra ""sabka-vikas"" Modi make changes to it?

**RBI bans letters of undertaking for seeking overseas loans**

Chowdhury/Mint

**Mumbai:** The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday barred banks from issuing letters of undertaking (LoUs), the instruments used by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi to perpetrate the over $2 billion PNB fraud, in a move that may deal a blow to trade financing in India and raise credit costs for importers.

RBI also barred lenders from issuing letters of comfort (LoC) as trade credit
for importing goods into India with immediate effect. It, however, allowed
banks to continue to issue letters of credit and bank guarantees.

**ALSO READ:** PNB exposure to alleged fraud swells to well over $2 billion

The move is likely to lead to a freeze in trade financing activities in India,
increasing costs for importers who have relied on these instruments to get
cheaper overseas credit to pay suppliers. It will also put companies that have
received credit based on LoUs in a spot, as they have to now repay their
borrowings since there will no rollover of existing LoUs.

Importers prefer taking loans based on LoUs as they are denominated in foreign
currency and are cheaper. A letter of credit, on the other hand, is used to
establish the credit worthiness of the buyer in the purchase of goods.

“LoUs and LoCs don’t come under a normal credit sanction. It has been
understood as giving just a letter. In the case of PNB, it looks like bank
officials issued these instruments without proper credit assessment,” said R.
Gandhi, a former deputy governor of RBI.

Lenders will have to look at alternative instruments like bank guarantees.
“Banks are now exploring alternative instruments like bank guarantees which
are typically used as a guarantee to raise loans from other banks,” an
official with a private sector bank said, requesting anonymity.

LoUs and LoCs are used widely in several industries including gems and
jewellery, oil and gas, electronic goods, solar panels and metals. Ajay Sahai,
director general at lobby Federation of Indian Export Organisations, however,
said, RBI’s move will have only a limited impact.

**ALSO READ:** Arun Jaitley says Nirav Modi got 1,213 fake PNB LoUs in 6 years

“I see only limited impact because gems and jewellery sector was the main
sector availing LoUs/LoCs. That, too, was limited to major players. Other
sectors have alternative instruments in the form of bank guarantees,” said
Sahai.

Until the PNB fraud surfaced, buyers’ credit was seen as a safe business
because of its short-term nature and the risk of default was essentially on
another lender. It also provided the LoU-issuing bank with a source of fee
income.

Charges on such credit had already started rising as banks became more
cautious following the PNB fraud. The interest of buyers’ credit is linked to
London Interbank Offered Rate.

**ALSO READ:** PNB, NiMo, and a floating rate loan that promises to really float

Currently, importers can avail of short-term buyers’ credit of up to a year at
8% annualized on a full-hedged basis, said Sajal Gupta, head, forex and rates,
at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.

“The rate may go up by at least 70-120 basis points because the inter-bank
market will dry up and not all banks have access to sufficient dollar
liquidity,” said Gupta.

The only problem we are facing here is not the troll. But these 'verified' accounts which want to turn everything into politics. *modi ne yeh kiya vo kiya. Bc tere desh ka PM hain. Bina proof ke to mat bol. Kam se kam screenshot de *",2018-03-14 09:52:55

**BJP to launch counter campaign over TDP's 'false propaganda'** 

 ______ 
AMARAVATI: The

BJP

today said it would launch a counter campaign soon against

TDP

's 'false propaganda' on Central assistance to the state, to place all facts
before the people on what the Modi government did for

Andhra Pradesh

in the last four years.

The state BJP's core committee, which met here under the chairmanship of AP
unit president and MP Kambhampati Haribabu, took strong exception to the
'false propaganda' being carried out by TDP on the Central assistance to the
state.

""Almost 85 per cent of the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014
have been fulfilled. The Centre is actively looking into other pending issues
and they too will be addressed soon,"" Haribabu told reporters at the end of
the core committee meeting.

He found fault with Telegu Desam Party for carrying out a 'misinformation
campaign' against the Centre that it had not done anything for the state in
the last four years.

""The ground realities speak for themselves. TDP claimed zero progress in the
construction of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences campus at
Mangalagiri, but in reality 17 blocks are being built at a fast pace.The
structures are there for everyone to see,"" the Visakhapatnam MP pointed out.

Likewise, nine national level institutes have started functioning in AP in the
last three years, whereas there was none prior to the bifurcation of the
state, he said.

""Thousands of crores of Rupees have been allocated for development of various
national highways running through the state and the works are progressing at a
brisk pace. How can anybody deny this when the development is glaringly
visible,"" Haribabu wondered.

He said there was a delay in fulfilling three promises made in the
Reorganisation Act.

""With regard to establishment of a new railway zone at Visakhapatnam, the
Centre is in talks with the neighbouring states,"" he said.

The second one on the process for setting up a steel plant in Kadapa district
has been expedited, while the Centre was ready to sanction a port in lieu of
the proposed one at Dugarajapatnam if the state suggests an alternative
location, the state BJP chief said.

""We will explain all these facts to the people. We will undertake a campaign
soon in this regard,"" he added.

Meanwhile, BJP floor leader in the Assembly P Vishnu Kumar Raju wondered why

YSR Congress

would want to join hands with his party, as being speculated.

""You better ask (YSRC president) Jagan about all such talk,"" he said.

Raju said some forces were trying to indulge in mudslinging at BJP through a
calculated misinformation campaign.

""The TDP once again raised the special status issue only to gain political
mileage. We will are preparing plans to counter TDP's campaign and place the
facts before the people,"" Raju added.

**Punjab National Bank’s Brady House branch opened LoUs for free: CBI** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: Until now, it has been assumed that firms owned by

Nirav Modi

and

Mehul Choksi

would have at least paid the customary commission, if not offering any
collateralised security, to the

Brady House branch

of the

Punjab National Bank

(PNB) for the letters of undertaking (LoU).

But the Central Bureau of Investigation (

CBI

) has now observed that the Brady House branch apparently did not take any
commission for about 150 such

LoUs

totalling Rs 6,498 crore, causing a potential loss in crores of rupees to the
public-sector lender.

A former banker at a state-run lender said a bank could normally earn around
1-1.5% commission for opening an LoU with a one-year maturity. It could earn
around half of that for opening an LoU with a six-month maturity. The LoUs,
which CBI says were issued between January and April last year to Nirav Modi
firms, allowed the beneficiaries to access cheap buyer’s credit abroad for
importing pearls and rough diamonds.

“The branch (Brady House) has not even taken commission for the opening of
LoUs in respect of around 150 LoUs and, thereby, caused a loss of crores of
rupees to the bank,” the agency observed while seeking judicial custody of MK
Sharma, the internal chief auditor of PNB arrested on February 28.

The 150 LoUs fall due from January 25 to April 20 this year. Sharma, the CBI
alleges, in conspiracy with other co-accused, deliberately “ignored to point
out the issuance of illegal LoUs and allowed Gokulnath Shetty to open LoUs to
favour the beneficiary private parties — Stellar Diamond, Solar Exports and
Diamonds R US, which resulted in huge loss/liability to Punjab National Bank
to the tune of Rs 6,498 crore.”

During police custody, Sharma denied having any knowledge of issuance of any
LoU in favour of the aforesaid firms. CBI said he allowed one of the main
accused, Gokulnath Shetty, former deputy manager at PNB, to perpetrate the
scam by not tallying the daily entries on Swift, used by the latter to
transmit the fraudulent LoU details to overseas branches of Indian banks, with
the bank’s core banking solution entries.

In the case of Gitanjali Gems and other related companies, CBI says Shetty
fraudulently issued 143 LoUs and enhanced the value of 313 foreign letters of
credit in favour of various overseas branches of Indian banks without
following the prescribed procedure.

**PNB fraud: Other banks may have to share scam burden** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Banks that lent money to jewellers

Nirav Modi

and

Mehul Choksi

based on fraudulent guarantees issued by

Punjab National Bank

will have to share the liability if they are found to be guilty of not
following norms, a government official said.

“For now PNB will honour all commitments as and when they arise, but if the
investigations reveal that there was impropriety on the part of other lenders
they will have to share half the burden,” a senior finance ministry official
said on condition of anonymity.

According to a parliamentary committee, as many as 30 banks, including some
foreign lenders, are believed to have paid out funds to Modi, Choksi and their
companies based on fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) they allegedly
made in collusion with PNB employees.

PNB’s exposure in the scam is estimated at Rs 12,700 crore. “We don’t think
there is any confusion on the payments. PNB has already committed to honour
all bonafide LoUs,” the finance ministry official said. He said all public
sector banks have already agreed to give a commitment to PNB that if the
investigations reveal there has been some slippage on their end they will
share the burden.

“The government will support all state-run lenders and for now we don’t see
that the payments on behalf of those Lo-Us will endanger the bank (PNB),” he
said, adding that whatever dispensation is allowed under the existing rules,
PNB will be getting the same.

A senior PNB official said it expects banking regulator

Reserve Bank of India

to allow the lender to make provisions against the fraud. “We don’t see a
major impact; besides, we are looking to raise resource through sale of our
non-core assets,” the official said.

PNB managing director Sunil Mehta had earlier said the bank will honour
commitments arising from the alleged fraud but any final payout will be based
on what’s revealed in inquiries. “The matter is under investigation. We will
see whatsoever our responsibility is and whatsoever the regulator says we will
definitely comply,” he had said. RBI has asked all lenders for details of the
LoUs they had written, including the amounts outstanding, and whether the
banks had pre-approved credit limits or kept enough cash on margin before
issuing the guarantees.

**PNB, Nirav Modi, and a floating home loan that promises to really float** 

 ______ 
The PNB fraud has left many of us feeling cheated although no money has gone
out of our pockets directly. We feel cheated because the rich and the well-
connected once again appear to have managed to get away after stealing a large
amount of money. The pictures of smug high lifers seem to be mocking those who
play by the rules.

We feel cheated because we are made to feel like criminals when we intersect
with the financial sector—each of us, every few years, has to redo our KYC
details. The linking of Aadhaar to various services has now reached a level
where a corporate chemist chain is sending texts to customers to link Aadhaar
to the account. When we seek a loan, the due diligence process is exhausting;
the contracts are not really two people agreeing, it is the weaker party (us)
just signing what the stronger party (bank) shoves across the table. Miss one
EMI or get behind your credit card payment and the hounding begins
relentlessly. A friend’s sister is a senior bank manager in a state-run bank
in a small town in middle India. A part of her territory is also the nearby
rural clusters and some of her work is loan recovery. As details of the Nirav
Modi theft emerged, her sense of disbelief grew. She said that when sometimes
people defaulted on loans, she has actually threatened to walk off with a cow
or a goat as collateral to make good the bank’s loss. For the poor people, who
will surely be even less able to pay their debt with their asset gone, the
loss would be mind numbing. But the rich get away with it because of political
patronage, collusion and greed. Fraud of this kind corrodes the overall value
system of a nation when people feel justified in cheating and not paying
taxes.

We feel cheated because the banks are allowed by a regulator to sell products
that are unfair. One such product has been a floating home loan. A ‘floater’,
as opposed to a fixed-rate loan, is supposed to be a fairer product as it is
market linked. A floater is pegged to a benchmark that goes up and down as the
interest rate cycle in the country moves. When rates go up, your floater rate
rises and when they go down, you pay less. That is theory. In real life,
interest rates on retail loans go up very fast but banks don’t allow them to
float down. That is because banks control their own benchmarks. The banking
regulator has tried several times to get the banks to behave better. The last
seven years have seen three attempts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to
change the way the benchmark is calculated, but none of them have worked
because banks still control the way the calculations are done.

It is in this context that when a bank comes out with a product that looks
fair, all red flags start to wave in our office. We do the math, look at the
fine print and think of ways in which the product will cheat the consumer.
Nine times out of 10 we find the monkey in the product. When Citi Bank
announced its third-party benchmark home loan product, we went through a
similar exercise. See this story by my colleague Vivina Viswanathan on how
this happens. We found that the product is benchmarked to the three-month
Treasury bill rate, which is not controlled by any one bank, and it does look
as if India has a true floater. This is the second attempt by a bank to use a
third-party benchmark. Around 2004, ING Vyasa Bank had launched India’s first
Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (Mibor) linked home loan. You can read about it
here. Several other banks too tried the product but were unable to compete
with banks that used their own benchmarks and the product was discontinued.
But can’t third-party rates be gamed? Of course, they can. Where there is a
banker, there is potential for gaming. The big Libor scandal showed how a
group of banks manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) to make
profits starting 2003. Over $9 billion have been paid by these banks in fines
for this manipulation of a benchmark, on which the world had pegged its
trades, rates and businesses. Read this story for more about the Libor scam:
Understanding the Libor Scandal

Experts say that the T-bill rate, on which the Citi product is pegged, will be
difficult to manipulate by a bank. It remains to be seen if other banks will
move to a third-party rate, what this benchmark will be, and whether they can
collude and fix that as well. Ideally, there should be one third-party rate
that all banks peg their rates to and which cannot be manipulated. They can
offer higher or lower spreads—of the difference between the benchmark rate and
the offered rate to the borrower.

Why has the RBI not forced banks to use a benchmark they cannot control?
That’s a larger question that the finance minister needs to ask: who is
responsible when a regulator is found lax? The Nirav Modi story is telling
retail banking consumers that the rules are only meant for us, the retail
consumers. The rich and well connected get a free pass. That the banks are
allowed to cheat retail consumers at will is not a good message in a pre-
election year for sure.

**BJP's U-turn on Naresh Agarwal triggers a storm on social media**

NEW DELHI. Social media slammed the BJP for inducting former

Samajwadi Party

(SP)

Naresh Agarwal

into the party fold yesterday and questioned the saffron party's apparent
U-turn in their opinion of him.

The widespread disapproval on Twitter had people digging out old tweets from
BJP leaders and spokespersons who had criticized Agarwal.

For example, here's what RSS 'vicharak' had tweeted about Agarwal a scant two-
odd months ago.

Agarwal was referring to former Indian Naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav
(currently languishing in Pakistani jail) as a ""terrorist"".

BJP's IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya had for the same reasons called Agarwal
""Pakistan's spokesperson"".

comments like ""Pak spokesperson joins BJP"".

BJP, and the party immediately distanced itself from a comment he made about
his former party colleague Jaya Bachchan. He called her a ""naachnewali"", or
""dancer"". Not only the BJP, many on Twitter too found it distasteful, giving
them more ammunition to criticise the BJP for accepting him as a member.

150,No doubt about it. All the propaganda points towards that direction. In a few years Modi will appear as a moderate ex-prime minister and we'd be talking about the same issues in a more divided country and worse economic situation.,2018-03-14 17:55:33

152,"Historically speaking, UP CMs have high chance of securing PMship thanks to the weight of the number of seats UP commands.

Earlier it wasn't possible due to regional parties securing majority in UP. In 2019 or 2024 if bhajeepav secures absolute majority in the number of LS seats, it is very likely that Yogiji can make himself a contender, thanks to his closeness with RSS top brass.

Modi was never a democratic PM candidate for BJP. His personal style of administration goes against RSS ethos of inner-party democracy. He was  wayyyy too autocratic as a RSS karyakarta and wayyyy more autocratic and centralised as a PM. 

BJP and RSS swallowed the bitter pill of Modi because they sensed the public mood before 2014. Would it have been possible they would've won in 2014 without Modi as the face? Absolutely yes, but with lesser numbers. ",2018-03-14 17:59:58

A young man has been arrested in Varanasi for posting on Facebook the minute-

parliamentary constituency, an official said on Wednesday.

Anup Pandey was arrested after the Special Protection Group (SPG), which
guards the Prime Minister, lodged a complaint with the Uttar Pradesh
government.

The SPG protested against the leak of the detailed programme which eventually
found way to the social media.

Pandey’s father is a retired Ayurvedic government practitioner and his family
told the police that he worked for the Prime Minister’s social media team two
years back but returned to Varanasi due to poor health.

Pandey is one of the 1,932 people followed by Modi on Twitter. Pandey has

**PNB fraud: We also feel the anger, hurt and pain at banking sector irregularities, says RBI Governor**

Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel on Wednesday expressed anguish at
the recent frauds and irregularities that have saddled the banking sector.
Alluding to the recent USD 2 billion scam in state-run Punjab National Bank
involving jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, Patel said, “We at
Reserve Bank also feel anger, hurt and pain at banking sector frauds and
irregularities. Banking frauds amount to looting of our country’s future by
some in the business community in cahoots with some lenders.”

The central bank chief suggested that internal processes at PNB failed by
allowing operational hazard to remain in place in spite of clear instructions
to close it. “If we need to face brickbats and be ‘the Neelakantha’ consuming
this poison, we will do so as our duty,” he said. Patel said RBI’s very
limited authority under banking acts as well as the custom to hold the public
sector boards accountable has become problematic, adding that “it’s not
feasible for the banking sector regulator to be in every nook and corner of
banking activity to rule out frauds by being there.”

Patel batted for legal reforms to empower the central bank to fully exercise
same responsibilities for PSBs as now apply to most private banks. He also
said there’s a need to refocus on the bigger issue of stressed assets
resolution. “Legal reforms are highly desirable to empower RBI to ensure a
level playing field in supervisory enforcement,” he added.

On February 14, state-owned PNB disclosed that it has discovered around Rs
11,400 crore worth of fraudulent transactions at Brady House branch in Mumbai.
The lender, in a complaint to the CBI, named some firms and persons associated
with diamantaire Nirav Modi along with some officials to defraud the bank
using bank guarantees. READ: PNB fraud: ED seeks Interpol warrant against
Nirav Modi, Choksi

As of today, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has moved the Interpol for
issuance of a Red Corner Notice against Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi in
connection with the scam. Officials said the agency had sought issuance of the
Interpol warrant against the two, based on court-issued non-bailable warrants
obtained by it in a money laundering case.

It has issued a whip to its shakhas (branches) to mobilize the cause of Hindutva.

Not only are pictures of Shah, sporting the tilak-chandan on his forehead, all over the newspapers in Uttar Pradesh, he too has camped in Ayodhya, declaring that Ram Janmabhoomi will be a major issue in the 2014 election.

**Underestimated SP-Mayawati Pact, Says Yogi Adityanath On Gorakhpur Loss** 

 ______ 
We will devise a strategy to counter SP-BSP political alliance, says Yogi
Adityanath

**Gorakhpur: **

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, whose home base Gorakhpur went
to the Samajwadi Party today in a

staggering upset

for the ruling BJP in bypolls, blamed ""overconfidence"" and conceded that his
party underestimated the potency of an Akhilesh Yadav-Mayawati combo.

""SP, BSP and Congress were separate but in the middle of the election they
decided to do a deal and form an alliance. We failed to understand it, and
somehow, overconfidence was one of the reasons for it,"" Yogi Adityanath said
in his first reaction. ""We will form a strategy to tackle this political
trading between the SP-BSP.""

Less than a year after its spectacular victory in UP, the BJP has

lost the key seats

of Phulpur and Gorakhpur to the Samajwadi Party. Gorakhpur was won five times
by Yogi Adityanath until he became Chief Minister last year. Phulpur was
vacated by Keshav Prasad Maurya, who became his deputy.

To put up a

credible challenge

on Yogi Adityanath's turf, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Mayawati's Bahujan
Samaj Party (BSP) joined hands in a quid pro quo in which the Samajwadi is to
help the BSP in Rajya Sabha polls.

What he had disparaged as a ""snake and mongoose"" alliance has delivered a
glancing blow to the priest-politician who became the BJP's mascot and chief
campaigner after the colossal UP win.

Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav addresses a press conference after his
party's candidates won the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls.

While campaigning for the bypolls, the saffron-robed chief minister even
declared them a ""dress rehearsal"" for 2019.

Today, he contradicted himself when asked whether the defeat should worry the
BJP. ""Local issues are crucial in by-polls. In national polls there will be
different issues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda will play
a role there,"" he said.

The Akhilesh-Mayawati combine was seen as a test of opposition unity and the
ability of enemies and frenemies to set aside their differences to fight the
BJP in the general election due next year.

__ Comments

But BJP leaders said they were caught short by the suddenness of the tie-up
and failed to do the math. ""We didn't expect that the BSP's vote will be
transferred to SP in such a manner,"" said Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya,
adding, ""We will analyze and prepare for a situation in future when BSP, SP
and Congress can come together and also make our strategy for winning the 2019
elections,"" he said.

The BJP has held Gorakhpur since 1989. Phulpur was important for the BJP as it
scooped up the seat for the first time in 2014 in a ""Modi wave"". The seat was
represented by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and later became
a BSP stronghold.

**Please don’t get swayed by power: Pravin Togadia to PM Modi** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| New Delhi |

Published: March 14, 2018 8:41 pm

Pravin Togadia (Express photo/File)

VHP leader Pravin Togadia on Wednesday claimed that the Modi government had
neither fulfilled its promises on Hindutva nor on development. In a letter to
Narendra Modi, Togadia sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to
discuss the fulfilment of the promises, especially the construction of the Ram
temple in Ayodhya and the adoption of a uniform civil code.

“Winning elections is a game of percentages, voter lists and EVMs. But
fulfilling the promises makes the leader a ‘Praja Lakshi’ (people focused)
leader,” Togadia wrote in the letter. “Bhai, please don’t get swayed in the
flow of power and more power. It is a state of inertia. Not nation building,”
the VHP’s International Working President wrote.

Talking to reporters after sharing his letter, Togadia said that he and Modi
may have not met and talked to each other for the last 12 years, but he would
like to meet and talk with his “Mota Bhai” (elder brother) for the fulfilment
of promises to the Hindus, including building of a grand Ram temple in
Ayodhya. “No other structure or a mosque can be constructed anywhere near (the
disputed site). This can be achieved only by a law in Parliament,” Togadia
said, adding that the BJP has a clear majority in the Lower House.

Togadia also demanded a national law banning cow slaughter, withdrawal of the
advisory issued by the Centre to all states against “cow protectors” and the
adoption of the Uniform Civil Code. “Neither promises on Hindutva are
fulfilled nor on Vikaas (Development),” Togadia said, while talking about the
Modi-led government’s tenure so far.

Raising farmers’ concerns, Togadia said they must get one and a half times the
value of their total expenditure on their crops without any hidden “ifs and
buts”. There should be no GST levied on agricultural equipments and farmers
loans should be waived off, he said.

Togadia also mentioned the problems of labourers and alleged that in the name
of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), new anti-labourer laws were being
enacted, which is hurting the human capital of the country. Ending the letter
on an emotional note, Togadia said that it was still not too late. “Let us sit
together, one to one, do the old time heart to heart discussions over cups of
simple roadside tea and let us take the nation ahead,” he wrote in the letter.

That's true to a certain point - it is the BJP's failure that is causing it to self destruct. But who do you think highlight's these failures to the public? The opposition. And in that, the Congress is the most vocal. And the fact that you agree that the BJP is losing, points to the fact that the Congress has been more successful than the government in convincing the people. 

&gt; Congress may probably win in Rajasthan and MP, but again it won't be to their credit, but mostly due to BJP having failed to govern these states.

Isn't that how all opposition parties win an election? So when do you really give credit to a party when they win an election? 

&gt; Why do we think that a uniform tax, cleanliness, a universal and verifiable identification programme are somehow genius 'ideas' or radical 'policies'?

They are ""radical"" (your choice of word) due to the *scale* of implementation. We are a democracy with a billion people and that's what is unique about us. We cannot ape the west or the Russian or the Japanese or the Chinese because our systems are different and our culture is different. We might be a developing country, but we are a country that has earned the respect of the west, and they look to us whenever we get ready to implement something they have already done, to learn from us. 

For example, when we become independent, we allowed every indian citizen to vote in our democracy. The west thought that it would be a disaster. And yet, seeing our success, they adopted it. 

A more recent example is Adhaar and Demonetisation. They are many western countries looking on how we implement the world's largest biometric identification system because they are interested in replicating it (note that I don't support Adhaar, but mention it as it is an apt example of the scale making it a unique program in the world). Demonetisation is now studied as a perfect example of what happens when idiots run a democracy like a banana republic, and an example of flawed policies that effect millions of people in a single stroke. 

Toilet construction is again a unique program, not only because of the scale, but also because how government have to actually educate people to use it and fight cultural resistance against it, and how we have to implement despite our constraints of a developing economy.

&gt; The fact that BJP is also not good at implementing the same ideas and policies just shows how incompetent and corrupt we are as a people, not as individual parties.

That is rubbish - blaming the people for the failure of PM Modi and his party. This government fails because they are inexperienced. They fail to implement these policies right because they don't respect other people's opinion and don't consult the opposition (because that would make them appear ""weak"").

208,"In the wake of the 2002 riots, Modi skillfully painted any criticism of his government’s misdeeds as an attack on Gujarat and Gujaratis. Over the past few years, and with considerably more subtlety, he has achieved the same thing with the story of the state’s development miracle. The government has relentlessly provided the media with positive stories of efficient administration, rapid construction and economic growth.

Modi likes to flaunt the fact that Gujarat is a power-excess state, and almost every big-picture story about the “Gujarat miracle”, from Business Today to The Sydney Morning Herald, highlights this fact. But farmers, led by the Sangh’s own farmers’ union, have been protesting for almost a decade that their electricity needs aren’t being met, and government statistics show that the share of power diverted to agriculture has fallen from 43 percent to 21 percent between 2000 and 2010. More than 375,000 farmers are still waiting for electricity connections for their irrigation pumps.

Even the headline figures for Gujarat’s economic expansion in the past decade diminish under closer examination. The state’s GDP growth has only slightly outpaced India as a whole over the past decade. But this is to be expected: Gujarat has long been an industrialised state—and in fact, growth rates under Modi are not significantly higher than they were in the prior two decades. Though Modi has presented Gujarat as the clear leader among Indian states in attracting foreign direct investment, it ranked fourth among states on this measure between 2000 and 2009, and in 2011 fell to sixth place, after Maharashtra, the National Capital Region, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh; Maharashtra has foreign direct investment inflows almost nine times greater than Gujarat.

Data from the Planning Commission, meanwhile, show that in spite of Gujarat’s economic growth, the state lags behind even Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in rates of poverty reduction. According to the 2011 India Human Development Report, Gujarat also scores poorly in several social indicators, with 44 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, worse than Uttar Pradesh.

By themselves, these statistics hardly constitute an indictment of Modi’s record. They merely suggest that his carefully constructed image as an economic miracle-worker has been the result of a well-managed public relations campaign whose false premise is that Gujarat stands head and shoulders above every other Indian state in growth and development—and that anyone who presents data to challenge this narrative is only twisting the truth in order to malign Modi and every Gujarati.

**Modi govt has failed on both Hindutva, development, says Praveen Togadia** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi:** Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia on Wednesday claimed that the Narendra Modi government had neither fulfilled its promises on Hindutva nor on development. 

In a letter to Narendra Modi, Togadia sought an appointment with the prime
minister to discuss the fulfilment of the promises, especially the
construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and the adoption of a uniform civil
code.

“Winning elections is a game of percentages, voter lists and EVMs. But
fulfilling the promises makes the leader a ‘Praja Lakshi’ (people focused)
leader,” Togadia wrote in the letter. “Bhai, please don’t get swayed in the
flow of power and more power. It is a state of inertia. Not nation building,”
the VHP’s international working president wrote.

Talking to reporters after sharing his letter, Togadia said that he and Modi
may have not met and talked to each other for the last 12 years, but he would
like to meet and talk with his _mota bhai_ (elder brother) for the fulfilment
of promises to the Hindus, including building of a grand Ram temple in
Ayodhya.

“No other structure or a mosque can be constructed anywhere near (the disputed
site). This can be achieved only by a law in parliament,” Togadia said adding
that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a clear majority in the lower House.

Togadia also demanded a national law banning cow slaughter, withdrawal of the
advisory issued by the centre to all states against “cow protectors” and the
adoption of the uniform civil code. “Neither promises on Hindutva are
fulfilled nor on _vikaas_ (development),” Togadia said, while talking about
the Modi-led government’s tenure so far.

Raising farmers’ concerns, Togadia said they must get one and a half times the
value of their total expenditure on their crops without any hidden “ifs and
buts”. There should be no goods and services tax (GST) levied on agricultural
equipments and farmers loans should be waived off, he said.

Togadia also mentioned the problems of labourers and alleged that in the name
of the foreign direct investment (FDI), new anti-labourer laws were being
enacted, which is hurting the human capital of the country.

Ending the letter on an emotional note, Togadia said that it was still not too
late. “Let us sit together, one to one, do the old time heart to heart
discussions over cups of simple roadside tea and let us take the nation
ahead,” he wrote in the letter.

**‘Brand Yogi’ takes a beating in home test** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The loss of

Gorakhpur

will hurt

chief minister Yogi Adityanath +

, and it will be more than the pain of an electoral defeat.

He has been more than just the local MP. He is, after all, head of the Goraksh
peeth, the spiritual and temporal centre of a region where he has held
unchallenged sway.

His rise as ‘chota mahant’ and claim to public support have been integral to
‘Brand Yogi’ that gained national attention ever since BJP’s leadership picked
him for the UP CM’s job. The move to pitch

Yogi

as a mainstream neta saw him embark on a new journey as a Hindutva icon, an
administrator and moderniser.

At a time when he has been in demand as a campaigner in the North-east,
Gujarat, Kerala and Karnataka, the defeat on home turf is a blow. He had
campaigned hard and SP’s win in a seat held by Yogi and his mentor

Avaidyanath

will dishearten followers; its ripples can go deeper in east UP.

BJP’s ascendancy in UP had led to Yogi being spoken of as a likely ‘national’
neta, who could take over the reins from PM

Narendra Modi

. This was more speculation, given Modi’s campaign and OBC roots are critical
to BJP’s success in UP. This discussion may now cool off — rivals could sniff
an opportunity to bring him down a peg or two.

The result cracks the veneer of invincibility that fort Gorakhpur had acquired
and takes some of the sheen off BJP’s success in the UP municipal elections
last year when it won 14 of 16 mayoral posts where it had none earlier. Not
just his initiatives, but Yogi being an upper-caste Rajput who is also a monk,
is key to

BJP

retaining its dominance in UP in the 2019 elections. BJP’s vote depends on
upper-caste consolidation and the support of sections of OBCs and Dalits.

Sources close to the CM claim differences between the BJP government and the
party was a big factor behind the loss. They say BJP workers canvassed with
reluctance, to the extent that campaign material was not distributed. RSS
volunteers were conspicuous by their absence.

The results show SP and BSP will present a formidable challenge. Yogi will
need to come up with more innovative strategies to divide his rivals.

**GST one of the most complex, and second highest tax rate in world: World Bank**

**New Delhi: **The goods and services tax (GST) implemented by the Narendra Modi government from 1 July last year is one of the most complex with the second highest tax rate in the world among a sample of 115 countries which have a similar indirect tax system, the World Bank said in a report.

India’s GST structure has five tax slabs of 0, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. Further,
there are several exempted sales and exports are zero rated, which allows
exporters to claim refund for taxes paid on inputs. Separately, gold is taxed
at 3% rate, precious stones at 0.25%, while alcohol, petroleum products, stamp
duties on real estate and electricity duties are excluded from the GST and
continue to be taxed by the state governments at state-specific rates.

As many as 49 countries around the world have a single slab of GST, while 28
countries use two slabs, and only five countries, including India, use four
non-zero slabs. The countries that use four or more slabs of GST include
Italy, Luxembourg, Pakistan and Ghana. Thus, India has among the highest
number of different GST slabs in the world.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley has promised to reduce the number of GST slabs
by merging 12% and 18% slabs once tax compliance improves and revenue buoyancy
increases. The federal indirect tax body, the GST Council, in its November
meeting last year in Guwahati, pruned the number of items under the 28% tax
slab to only 50 from 228 items earlier.

The World Bank, in its bi-annual India Development Update released on
Wednesday, said the introduction of GST has been accompanied by state
administrations experiencing disruptions in initial days after GST’s
introduction. This included lack of clarity on discontinuation of local taxes,
for example, in Tamil Nadu where the state government devolved an
entertainment tax to local governments in order to impose it over and above a
28% GST. To preserve revenue collections, Maharashtra has also increased motor
vehicles tax to compensate for losses due to GST.

There also have been reports of an increased administrative tax compliance
burden on firms and a locking-up of working capital due to slow tax refund
processing, the World Bank said. “High compliance costs are also arising
because the prevalence of multiple tax rates implies a need to classify inputs
and outputs based on the applicable tax rate. Along with the need to apply the
correct rate, firms are required to match invoices between their outputs and
inputs to be eligible for full input tax credit, which increases compliance
costs further,” it added.

However, the World Bank said while international experience suggests that the
adjustment process can affect economic activity for multiple months, the
benefits of the GST are likely to outweigh its costs in the long run. “Key to
success is a policy design that minimizes compliance burden, for example by
minimizing the number of different rates and limiting exemptions, with simple
laws and procedures, an appropriately structured and resourced administration,
compliance strategies based on a balanced mix of education and assistance
programs and risk-based audit programs,” it said.

The Bank advocated for a nuanced communications campaign to convey the various
aspects of the new system of GST among businesses, consumers and key
intermediaries, such as tax practitioners, as well as among the tax
administration and the political class.

slab to only 50 from 228 items earlier.

The World Bank, in its bi-annual India Development Update released on
Wednesday, said the introduction of GST has been accompanied by state
administrations experiencing disruptions in initial days after GST’s
introduction. This included lack of clarity on discontinuation of local taxes,
for example, in Tamil Nadu where the state government devolved an
entertainment tax to local governments in order to impose it over and above a
28% GST. To preserve revenue collections, Maharashtra has also increased motor
vehicles tax to compensate for losses due to GST.

There also have been reports of an increased administrative tax compliance
burden on firms and a locking-up of working capital due to slow tax refund
processing, the World Bank said. “High compliance costs are also arising
because the prevalence of multiple tax rates implies a need to classify inputs
and outputs based on the applicable tax rate. Along with the need to apply the
correct rate, firms are required to match invoices between their outputs and
inputs to be eligible for full input tax credit, which increases compliance
costs further,” it added.

However, the World Bank said while international experience suggests that the
adjustment process can affect economic activity for multiple months, the
benefits of the GST are likely to outweigh its costs in the long run. “Key to
success is a policy design that minimizes compliance burden, for example by
minimizing the number of different rates and limiting exemptions, with simple
laws and procedures, an appropriately structured and resourced administration,
compliance strategies based on a balanced mix of education and assistance
programs and risk-based audit programs,” it said.

The Bank advocated for a nuanced communications campaign to convey the various
aspects of the new system of GST among businesses, consumers and key
intermediaries, such as tax practitioners, as well as among the tax
administration and the political class.

&gt; For the Calcutta High Court, name of Mohammed Nizamuddin was initially recommended by Supreme Court Collegium, which was **returned by Central Government on 11.11.2016. The collegium again recommended the name on 15.11.2016 and that was returned again on 01.03.2017. The Collegium reiterated the name once again on 07.04.2017 and the name is still pending with the Central Government**. Similarly names of Samba Sarkar ,Sabyasaji Choudhary, RaviKapoor, Arindam Mukherji  ,and Sakya Sen were recommended on 04.12.2017 by collegium but still  the file is pending with the Central Government.  The Calcutta High Court is functioning at less than half the strength of sanctioned posts of 72, with 33 judges. So much so that Calcutta lawyers called for five days strike to protest delay in filling up of vacancies.

&gt; For Karnataka High Court, **the name of Narendra Prasad is also pending with the Central Government for 11 months .

&gt; Though the Central Government is bound by the recommendation of the collegium, there is no stipulation as to the time frame within which the collegium recommendations have to be considered.  **It appears that the Central Government is making use of this loophole of lack of time-limit by sitting over files to defeat collegium recommendations.**

&gt; **The data collected by Live Law research team reveals that a staggeringly high number of more than 146 names are pending for judicial appointment. Most of such names are pending at the Government level, after clearance by the Supreme Court Collegium.**

Isn’t the government aware of its crucial role in setting the justice delivery system in smooth functioning, with adequate number of judges to handle the work load?

&gt; ... This puts a former CJI to much stress, and **that was what the nation witnessed when CJI Thakur failed to veil his emotions at a public function and had to dry his eyes, while speaking of the judicial workload**. Imagine, the CJI of this country had to literally plead to the government to fill judicial posts and to appoint adequate number of judges. **The Prime Minister Narendra Modi who witnessed the candid disclosure of feelings by the Hon’ble CJI, responded in his usual masterly style stating that he was not a person who would merely walk away from issues of importance**; the Prime Minister assured that he would study the matter seriously and would find a way. All this happened in April 2016. The “way” is yet to be unraveled.

&gt; The names of Justice K. M. Joseph and Indu Malhotra, Senior Advocate, have been pending with the Govenrment after their recommendations to elevation as SC judges by collegium during January 2018. **Reportedly, the Centre is not favouring the elevation of Justice Joseph, and is objecting to his elevation for no reasons. However, the real reason for the objection is widely speculated as the Centre’s unhappiness over Justice Joseph rendering judgment against the Centre by quashing imposition of presidential rule in Uttarakhand in May 2016**.

**TDP set to exit NDA alliance, will back YSR Congress’ ‘no-confidence’ motion in Parliament** 

 ______ 
Written by

Sreenivas Janyala

| Hyderabad |

Updated: March 15, 2018 4:35 pm

TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has called
a politburo meeting Friday to take a final call on the issue of exiting from
the NDA.

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) is all set to break its alliance with the BJP and
could exit the NDA as early as Friday. The party has also decided to support
the YSR Congress Party’s no-confidence motion in Parliament tomorrow.

TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has called
a politburo meeting Friday to take a final call on the issue of exiting from
the NDA. Sources said that a majority of the members including MPs, MLAs and
senior leaders have already told Naidu to quit NDA. “This is the final option.
The CM is livid that instead of resolving issues faced by the state, the BJP
is indulging in dirty politics that it played in Tamil Nadu,’’ TDP leader
Kambhampati Rammohan Rao said.

On Thursday, in a teleconference with his MPs, Naidu accused the BJP and Prime
Minister Narendra Modi of using YSR Congress Party and actor K Pavan Kalyan’s
Jena Sena Party to target him and the TDP. Naidu told the MPs that Modi was
applying the same strategy that was used in Tamil Nadu where BJP supported OPS
faction against EPS in the AIADMK. Naidu said that instead of addressing the
issues raised by the state such as allocating special funds, bridging revenue
gap or special category status as promised in the Andhra Pradesh
Reorganisation Act, 2014, PM Modi was using the Tamil Nadu template to pit
YSRCP and Jena Sena against TDP.

**Read | TDP walks out of Govt: Why the fallout poses a challenge to BJP’s numbers count for 2019**

Naidu also referred to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar bypoll results on Wednesday in
which the BJP lost, and opined that there is a strong anti-incumbency against
the BJP and Modi.

On March 8, the TDP withdrew its two ministers from the Union Cabinet,
accusing the BJP of reneging on its promises to give special category status
to Andhra Pradesh.

**Express Explained** | **Here’s what has put the TDP’s ties with the BJP under strain**

The TDP is also evaluating if actor K Pavan Kalyan, who supported the BJP-TDP
alliance and who broke his association with the TDP, has been instructed by
the BJP to attack the party. At a public meeting in Guntur, Wednesday evening,
the actor who heads the Jena Sena Party accused the TDP, CM Naidu and his son
Lokesh Naidu of indulging in corruption and running an incompetent government.
Pavan’s direct allegations and attacks have rattled the TDP and although he is
considered a novice in politics, leaders have asked that the actor-turned-
politician’s ambitions be evaluated.

“Pavan Kalyan, who is very popular among youth, can swing the vote, especially
the votes of the powerful Kapu community, towards any side he so chooses. His
support for the BJP-TDP alliance also played a role in helping the TDP win
with a slender margin in the 2014 elections. Now that he has turned against
the TDP, it is a cause for concern in the party,’’ a leader said.

**Jay Shah defamation case: SC asks Gujarat trial court to suspend proceedings against The Wire till April 12** 

 ______

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Updated: March 15, 2018 6:33 pm

Jay Shah case: CJI Dipak Misra said he was against gagging media but also
said, “we expect the media should be responsible, electronic media should be
more responsible.”

The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Gujarat trial court not to proceed
with criminal defamation proceedings against news portal The Wire in a case
filed by Jay Shah till it hears the matter related to the quashing of the case
next on April 12. The top court also asked Jay Shah, who is the son of BJP
president Amit Shah, and others involved, to file responses within two weeks
to the plea filed by the scribe.

The apex court also criticised the media in general over irresponsible
reporting.

Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra said he was against gagging media but
also said, “we expect the media should be responsible, electronic media should
be more responsible.”

Senior Advocate N K Kaul, appearing for Jay Shah, contended that The Wire
story was a “manufactured story, scurrilous reporting” and was meant to damage
Shah’s reputation. “The reporting was part of a design”, he said

Kapil Sibal who appeared for the news portal said it was only asking questions
to Shah. “If journalism is going to be throttled like this, no journalist can
ask questions,” he said.

In a setback to The Wire, the Gujarat High Court had in February ordered to
restore the ex parte injunction, barring the website from publishing any
further report on Jay and his firm’s turnover.

According to The Wire report, Jay Shah’s firm had increased 16,000 times in
the year after Narendra Modi was elected as Prime Minister. The website is
facing Rs100-crore damage suit, filed by Jay Shah, in a trial court in October
2017.

**India sets example for others to emulate: Commonwealth chief** 

 ______ 
LONDON: The Commonwealth chief has lauded

India

for its ""strong commitment"" towards the 53-nation grouping, saying it has set
an example which the other member countries have emulated.

Commonwealth Secretary-General

Baroness Patricia Scotland

said the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Britain
next month marks a ""great time"" for India to lead the way on intra-
Commonwealth cooperation.

Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

will join heads of state from the member-countries at the summit in

London

and Windsor in April, during which they will get a chance to have ""very
personal and direct"" interactions, Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness
Patricia Scotland said at a pre-summit briefing here yesterday.

""India has done a lot on innovation and in every ministerial Commonwealth
meeting, we see strong commitment from India. In welcoming that strong
commitment from India, I am so happy to see it matched by the other 52
countries and the south-south cooperation taking place,"" she said.

""It is a great time for India and it is exciting to see the energised way in
which new opportunities are being taken up,"" she said.

Scotland highlighted India's active role and ""great generosity"" during the
recent Commonwealth education ministers' meeting in Fiji, where it shared with
other member-states its Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) platform for
education, innovation and change.

During the law ministers meeting in the Bahamas last year, India shared the
sort of instruments being created to get cheaper, better and faster processes.

""Looking at the opportunity, we have launched a small and medium enterprise
network in India and we are hoping to have a branch of that in the Pacific,""
said Scotland, who hailed India as the biggest democracy with 1.1 billion of
the 2.4 billion people within the organisation's membership landscape.

CHOGM on April 19 and 20 will be preceded by the

Commonwealth Business Forum

between April 16-18, which will bring together hundreds of business people and
stakeholders from across the 53 Commonwealth countries.

""Participation from Indian businesses to the Commonwealth Business Forum is
just staggering in terms of the calibre, range, innovation and dynamism,"" said
Richard Burge, CEO of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council
(CWEIC), who will be leading the trade and business strand of the agenda.

""India is a huge nation, it is bound to have a huge impact with its incredibly
diverse economy. It is a really knock-your-socks-off economy and we should be
really proud of it as a member and take every advantage that we can,"" he said.

The theme of CHOGM, being chaired by Britain this year, is ""Towards a Common
Future"" and is focused on building on the strengths of the Commonwealth.

The last trade review of the organisation in 2016 had flagged a ""Commonwealth
advantage"", which indicated that bilateral costs for trading partners in
Commonwealth countries were on average 19 per cent less than between those in
non-Commonwealth countries.

The 2018 summit will mark the launch of a new trade review, which will show
that the Commonwealth is likely to miss its target of USD 1 trillion of trade
between its members by 2020.

""The growth is slightly slower than we thought it was going to be because the
global market has slowed down. We hoped it would be about a trillion by 2020 -
the estimate now is it's probably going to be about 700 billion,"" said
Scotland.

However, she said the range of disruptive technologies that were being thrown
up held great promise for the ""revitalised"" relationship right across the
Commonwealth.

The Commonwealth is a diverse community of 53 nations that work together to
promote prosperity, democracy and peace.

**BJP may go for early Lok Sabha polls after defeat, says Mayawati** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| Chandigarh |

Published: March 15, 2018 7:26 pm

BSP Supremo Mayawati. Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Thursday said the BJP may call for early
Lok Sabha elections after its stunning defeat in the parliamentary bypolls in
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, whose gamble
of backing the Samajwadi Party for the bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur in the
state paid rich dividends, said the idea was to teach the party a lesson.
Addressing a rally at Chandigarh, she labelled the Narendra Modi government at
the Centre a “dictatorship” and alleged that it had “surpassed” the Emergency
imposed by the Congress government in 1975.

Mayawati also accused the government of weakening democracy and making
constitutional organisations and the media ineffectual. “In Uttar Pradesh, we
wanted to teach the BJP a lesson and decided to support SP candidates so that
it loses the seats earlier held by the chief minister and deputy chief
minister… They have lost their sleep with this result,” she said. The BJP lost
out to the SP in both Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the former vacated by Chief
Minister Yogi Adityanath and the latter by his Deputy Chief Minister Keshav
Prasad Maurya when they were elected to the legislative council. The BJP also
lost the Lok Sabha bypoll in Araria in Bihar.

“With yesterday’s result, there is great possibility that the BJP will advance
the Lok Sabha polls, which are otherwise to be held in 2019,” Mayawati said.
The party, she added, may hold Lok Sabha polls along with assembly elections
in seven-eight states. “They know that the more they delay, the more damaging
it can be for them,” she said at the rally. Referring to allegations of EVM
tampering, she said only ballot papers should be used in the forthcoming
elections.

Urging people not to let political outfits like the BJP come to power again,
the BSP chief said most people were disappointed with the performance of the
BJP-led government at the Centre and warned them against “false and tempting
poll promises”. “Modi had given the slogan, ‘Na khaunga, na khaane dunga’ to
eliminate corruption. But scams worth crore of rupees have surfaced involving
people like Lalit Modi, Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, which proved that slogan
hollow. These corrupt people are enjoying their lives in foreign countries
with the tacit support of the government,” she alleged.

Accusing the government of giving whatever black money it recovered from the
corrupt to “capitalists”, she said the money could have been used in
containing inflation and for the benefit of poor people. The BSP chief also
spoke out against the Hindutva approach of the RSS and its “casteist, narrow-
minded and communal approach”. People belonging to Dalits and weaker section
who had been given higher positions by BJP government were working as “bonded
labour”, she alleged.

Mayawati accused the BJP government of misusing agencies like the ED, CBI and
the Income Tax Department against its opponents to make the country
“opposition free”. “Under the garb of curbing corruption and black money, they
are targeting their political opponents. However, they are covering the
corruption allegations being levelled against their own leaders,” she said.
She claimed that people were upset with demonetisation and GST, which were
taken without proper preparation.

“Problems like poverty, inflation prevail under their regime and economy of
the country has also weakened. The voices of opposition in their own party can
now also be heard,” she said.

**India supports developing Chabahar port as alternate access route to Afghanistan, Central Asia: MEA** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| New Delhi |

Updated: March 15, 2018 8:05 pm

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called the Chabahar port the “golden gateway”
to access landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asian region.

Days after Iran invited China and Pakistan to participate in development of
the Chabahar port, India today said it was the prerogative of the Iranian
government to choose its partners for the project.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, during a three-day visit to Islamabad,
invited Pakistan and China to participate in the strategic Chabahar Port
project, saying it is not aimed at “strangulating” or “encircling” anybody.

“It is the prerogative of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to
choose its partners for the development of infrastructure facilities there,”
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said during a media
briefing.

The first phase of the Chabahar port on the Gulf of Oman was inaugurated four
months ago, opening a new strategic route connecting Iran, India and
Afghanistan bypassing Pakistan. India has been a key partner in the
development of the port which is easily accessible from India’s western coast
and is increasingly seen as a counter to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port, being
developed with Chinese investment.

“As you are aware, India is supporting the development of Chahbahar Port as a
robust and alternate access route to and for Afghanistan and Central Asia,”
said Kumar, adding significant progress has been made in operationlising the
port.

In November last year, India delivered the first consignment of wheat to
Afghanistan through the Chabahar Port. “Shipment of wheat assistance to
Afghanistan through Chahbahar is being successfully carried out since October
last year. Four such shipments have been successfully delivered,” said Kumar.

He said India’s assistance for building Chabahar-Zahedan Railway to realise
the full potential of the port and to connect it to Afghanistan and Central
Asia was discussed during Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s visit here last
month.

“We continue to work with Iran on the full and effective operationalisation of
the Chabahar Port,” said Kumar. India, Iran and Afghanistan had signed a
trilateral agreement in 2016 to jointly develop the Chabahar port.

If these Markets were illegal - why were they taking commercial rents and taxes? Are we living in a country where anyone in power can screw the life of a common man?

**""You Think You Can Write Anything And Get Away?"": Chief Justice Raps Media** 

 ______ 
Justice Dipak Misra defended the freedom of press while saying there are
limits

**New Delhi: **

Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra today sharply criticised the electronic
media during a hearing in the Supreme Court on a defamation suit against the
website

_The Wire_

over a story on BJP president Amit Shah's son Jay Shah. ""We respect freedom of
the press but it has to act responsibly. Electronic media can't think they
become Popes overnight,"" he said, asserting that he was speaking in general,
not about the case.

The Supreme Court put on hold the defamation case until it takes up the case
next on 12 April.

During the hearing, Justice Misra used strong words against the TV media.

""Many in electronic media think they can write anything. Whatever suits your
imagination can you write anything and get away? Can some people sit on the
pulpit and write anything? Is that journalism?"" the Chief Justice said.

He added that while he was all for the freedom of press, ""how can anyone start
speaking anything about anyone? There are limits. How can you comment on
anyone whatever you like?""

__ Comments

The Gujarat High Court had in January rejected the website's petition asking
that the defamation case filed by Jay Shah for its report accusing him of
corruption be cancelled. The court said based on initial impression, there was
a case against Wire's reporter and editors. The court held that ""the most
disturbing part of the article"", which can be ""prima facie termed as
defamatory"", is linking the rise in Jay's firm's turnover with the election of
Narendra Modi as Prime Minister.

The Wire had in its article ""The Golden Touch of Jay Amit Shah"", alleged that
Jay Shah's company's turnover grew exponentially after the BJP came to power
in 2014. The Wire had said its report is based on documentary evidence and so
they cannot be tried for criminal defamation.

the country when the noose tightened around them. Graphic: Mint

**Mumbai:** Even as harsh legislation to punish fugitive economic offenders takes shape in India, 31 individuals accused of fraud and economic offences are holed up abroad, the ministry of external affairs said.

These people, pursued by the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) in 15 different cases, collectively owe Rs40,000 crore to
banks and public institutions in India, calculations by _Mint _based on
investigation reports show.

**ALSO READ:** After 31 top defaulters flee, Modi govt seeks to shut the gates for 91 others

The list of fugitives that the ministry of external affairs submitted in the
Lok Sabha on Wednesday includes some well-known names and some not-so-well-
known ones.

Among the prominent names are Vijay Mallya, who owes Rs9,000 crore to a group
of banks; Nirav Modi, his wife Ami Modi, brother Neeshal Modi and uncle Mehul
Choksi, named in the Rs12,636 crore fraud at Punjab National Bank; Jatin Mehta
of Winsome Diamonds, who owes Rs7,000 crore; former Indian Premier League
chief Lalit Modi, accused of siphoning off Rs125 crore from the country’s
cricket board; and Sterling Biotech Ltd directors Chetan Jayantilal Sandesara
and Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara for alleged bank fraud of Rs5,000 crore.

**ALSO READ:** Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill to cover wide-ranging white-collar crimes

The lesser-known names include Ashish Jobanputra, promoter of Mumbai-based
textile export firm ABC Cotspin Pvt. Ltd, and his wife in a bill discounting
scam of Rs770 crore and for causing losses to banks; diamond trader Ritesh
Jain for illegally taking Rs1,500 crore out of the country; Surender Singh,
Angad Singh and Harsahib Singh for cheating and criminal conspiracy; Sabhya
Seth for a fraud of Rs390 crore against Oriental Bank of Commerce; and Sanjay
Bhandari for alleged tax evasion of Rs150 crore.

Nilesh Parekh of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, accused of a Rs2,223 crore bank
fraud, was arrested by CBI last year after he returned to India to join the
probe. There is little to no public information about the rest of the names.

Experts say legislation to target fugitive economic offenders will act as a
deterrent and could also be used retrospectively in some cases.

“The legislation is not stated to be retrospective in effect. However,
directors of enforcement agencies can make an application to declare any
person as ‘fugitive economic offender’ if the said person either leaves or has
left India in order to avoid criminal prosecution and/or refuses to return to
India to face criminal prosecution. Therefore, for offences which have been
committed even before the coming into effect of the bill as an Act, it will
help,” said Sandeep Grover, partner at law firm IndusLaw.

261,"&gt; ... The north of India is known as the “Hindi Belt” or cow belt. These are the large states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Two of them are scheduled for state polls this year. And all of them share an intrinsic economic and social relationship with the cow. In 2014, this was exploited by the BJP.

&gt; It started off as an emotive issue when Modi, as a prime ministerial candidate in 2014, raised the issue of a “Pink Revolution“. Eating beef is seen as an affront to fundamentalist Hindus, who believe that since they drink cow’s milk, it elevates the bovine to motherhood status. But this led to widespread harassment and lynchings, as vigilante groups, supported by the state, began to attack people. This hit the rural economy as farmers were unable to sell off unproductive cows and those who traded skins, or consumed its meat, were deprived of their traditional livelihood. This meant a very high cost for protecting cows and left farmers severely distressed.

&gt; The move to ban 87% of India’s currency notes in November 2016 also hurt a huge number of people. While the BJP swept Uttar Pradesh a month later, the effects of radical demonetization never went away. Small-scale enterprises and traders were hit and they continued to suffer losses. As time passed, the purported benefits of demonetization did not materialize.

&gt; The lack of jobs and failure of the Modi government to create jobs is also beginning to hurt. The promises made by Modi and the BJP are far from being fulfilled. Expectations are turning into disappointment and voters are beginning to desert the party’s themes of Hindu solidarity and pride. The state elections in Gujarat earlier this year, where Modi hails from, saw the Congress put up a robust fight and come close to ending nearly 22 years of BJP rule. Some saw it as a fight between Modi, the hope, and Modi, the disappointment...",2018-03-16 09:25:18

And though the BJP still enjoys a simple majority in the lower house of parliament, it will face problems of floor management and prospects of muscle-flexing by smaller allies. But if **the government’s bulldozing of the finance bill on March 14** is anything to go by, it will continue to brazen it out.

&gt; In any case, **the first half of the Modi government’s tenure was marked by incremental reforms. Some drastic measures like the November 2016 demonetisation to formalise the economy summarily flopped. The much-touted goods and services tax (GST), aimed at replacing a whole bunch of levies, is yet to have a positive effect on the economy. In fact, the GST has only robbed state governments of substantial revenues in the short-term**. Meanwhile, the adoption of the recommendations of successive finance commissions has further squeezed funds and created complications.

&gt; Following the lacklustre electoral performance in his home state of Gujarat, Modi attempted to give the rural economy a much-vaunted budgetary push. However, **the countryside remains depressed and angry. His government’s ambitious national health insurance scheme, covering 40% of the population, would take at least a year to roll out and some 20 years to reach the last man**.
 
&gt; **Meanwhile, the country’s banking system is creaking under pressure owing to bad debts and, now, a string of massive frauds**. The recapitalisation process underway can only help that much. Modi’s infrastructure sector push is yet to gather momentum, too.

&gt; **Overall, for several reasons, out-of-the-box solutions to the country’s many structural problems haven’t exactly been forthcoming**...",2018-03-16 10:01:37

**Congress may weigh youth quota under Rahul Gandhi's leadership** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

Congress

president

Rahul Gandhi

is expected to unveil an agenda for youth in the upcoming

AICC

session, designed to make the

Grand Old Party

younger and energetic down the line. A section of leadership has also placed a
proposal on quota for youth at all levels of party leadership, perhaps in the
new

Congress Working Committee

itself, sources said. This is aimed at bringing about a generational shift in
the party.

ET reported on Thursday that many senior leaders have already expressed their
readiness to make way for the younger lot to help Gandhi build his team. The
fact that may top leaders of Congress are already in the 65-75 age group,
empowering more young leaders has also become a political and organisational
necessity for the Congress. The party has been trying to position Rahul Gandhi
as leader of the youth, a social segment that accounts for around 65%
population, thereby making them the largest vote-bank of the country. At the
same time, many senior leaders will also continue in Rahul Gandhi’s team,
giving it a blend of young and experienced leaders, more so when the party has
to face the entrenched Narendra Modi-led

BJP

.

Along with youth, the AICC session will also strive to give a new meaningful
role to the party workers by ensuring that they are heard in the party’s day-
to-day functioning and in decision and policy-making processes, a leader said.
The steering committee meeting on Friday will finalise the AICC resolutions
and, as reported earlier, the session will call upon a united fight against
BJP even as it asserts rebuilding party base as the top priority. While many
advocate consensus route for constituting new CWC, Rahul will be mandated to
decide whether to call elections to CWC.

The party is also planning to release booklets, in many languages, as critique
of NDA government’s sectorwise performance.

Gandhi will make his inaugural address on Saturday and valedictory address on
Sunday.

While Rahul has taken charge as party chief,

Sonia Gandhi

continues as leader of

Congress Parliamentary Party

and the anchor for Congress.

special status for Andhra Pradesh (Express Photo/Anil Sharma/File)

Following its decision to withdraw support from the NDA this morning, the
Telugu Desam Party (TDP) will move a no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha against
the BJP-led government. The move comes a week after two of its ministers — P
Ashok Gajapathi Raju and Y S Chowdary — resigned from the Union Cabinet over
the Centre’s refusal to grant Andhra Pradesh special status. The decision was
taken by TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu
at a meeting with politburo members this morning. The motion will have to be
accepted by at least 50 members.

Naidu is learnt to have reportedly accused the BJP of “collusion politics”, or
using Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s party and actor K Pavan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party
to target the TDP. An MP said, “He (Naidu) said that while we are fighting for
self-respect, rights of Telugu people, and implementation of promises made to
us, the BJP is resorting to collusion politics.” On Thursday, the sources told
_The Indian Express_ that majority of the party’s MPs and MLAs are in support
of TDP quitting the NDA.

Making good on its threat, N Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on
Friday withdrew support from the NDA government over the Centre’s refusal to
grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Naidu took the decision in an
emergency teleconference with party politburo members and MPs this morning.
_The Indian Express_ had on Thursday first reported the TDP’s decision to walk
out of the coalition.

The move follows the resignation of two of the TDP’s ministers — P Ashok
Gajapati Raju and Y S Chowdary — from the Union Cabinet on March 8. At the
time, the TDP had not revealed its mind on quitting the coalition altogether.
The two union ministers had stepped down after a meeting with Prime Minister
Narendra Modi over the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.

**Express Explained | Why Andhra Pradesh, Centre can’t agree on special category status**

Separately, the TDP will also move a no-confidence motion against the Narendra
Modi government in the Lok Sabha today. The no-confidence motion will be moved
over the injustice meted out to the state, an official communique from the
party said.

The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) had on Thursday given a notice for moving a no-
confidence motion against the government in Lok Sabha but TDP sources had told
_The Indian Express_ that the party would support its rival.

The Congress will support the TDP’s no-confidence motion against the Centre
and YSR Congress Party, news agency ANI quoted Andhra Pradesh Congress
Committee president N Raghuveera Reddy as saying.

As things move, the TDP will now write a letter to BJP president Amit Shah and
also other constituents of the NDA informing them of its decision and the
reasons for it. TDP has 16 members in the Lok Sabha. Its pullout, however,
does not threaten the coalition.

In a teleconference with his MPs on Thursday, Naidu is learnt to have accused
the BJP of resorting to “collusion politics”. According to sources, he also
said there was a strong anti-BJP mood in the country, as reflected in the
bypoll results on Wednesday.

Naidu also allegedly accused the BJP of using Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP
and actor K Pavan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party to target the TDP. He said the BJP
was applying the same strategy it used in Tamil Nadu, where it supported the
OPS faction against EPS in the AIADMK.

Meanwhile, BJP national spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao said the TDP’s decision
to quit was inevitable after its mischievous propaganda against the Centre.
“People of Andhra Pradesh have now realised that the TDP is resorting to lies
to cover up its inept &amp;amp; inert governance.Far from being a threat, TDP’s
exit is a timely opportunity for the BJP to grow in AP,” Rao tweeted.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee welcomed the decision, “I welcome
the TDP’s decision to leave the NDA. The current situation warrants such
action to save the country from disaster,” she tweeted.

“I appeal to all political parties in the Opposition to work closely together
against atrocities, economic calamity and political instability,” she added.

**Clean India: Building a healthy nation through education** 

 ______ 
In July 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recognising
sanitation—“access to, and use of, excreta and wastewater facilities and
services”—as a human right. In India, however, a lot of low-income homes don’t
have access to toilets, thus denying them of the right. People resort to open
defecation, and have no sound personal hygiene habits. Deeply-ingrained
cultural practices are squarely to be blamed for this.

In a lot of homes in rural India, a toilet in the front yard—an area earmarked
for the holy Tulsi plant— is considered “impure”. Diane Coffey and Dean Sears,
authors of ‘Where India Goes’, attribute this aversion to the fact that manual
scavenging was traditionally the job of the oppressed castes. Even with people
in positions of power showing the way by emptying toilet pits themselves, this
hostility towards toilets remains.

Ill-informed ideas about hygiene are not limited to just toilets. Many people
believe that water that looks clean is fit enough to drink; boiling or
filtering it is not considered to be a necessity. However, what they don’t
realise is groundwater as well as other sources of drinking water are polluted
due to rapid industrialisation and population explosion. A lot of people also
don’t consider it essential to wash their hands with soap.

**Mission cleanliness**

To change such age-old systems, we need to first educate people. The Swachh
Aadat curriculum has been instrumental in showing us how to go about it.

Launched as part of HUL’s Swachh Aadat, Swachh Bharat campaign, this 21-day
project aims to teach children in the age group of 5 to 10 the importance of
hygiene. It has highlighted three important habits that every child should
adopt— washing hands at five critical occasions of the day, drinking purified
water, and using clean toilets.

To make the project interesting, a wide range of activities, games, and
characters such as Chamatkari Sonu (a superhero) and Kitabyutor (kitab +
computer) are employed. Students are taught either through books or
e-textbooks for approximately 20 minutes a day. They are encouraged not just
to learn for themselves, but to also bring about a sanitation revolution in
their communities.

One can learn from the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which has made tremendous
progress in increasing access to hygiene. Launched by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi on October 2, 2014, it has increased sanitation coverage in India from 42
% in October 2013 to 60% in 2018. As of February 2018, more than 6.25 crore
toilets had been constructed in rural India, thereby completing nearly 80% of
the target. No other country has ever built so many toilets at a stretch; it
is an achievement that every Indian should be proud of.

For the demographic dividend to be an asset, India needs healthier young
people. We can’t afford to lose out as a nation because of unscientific
beliefs.

**Leading by example**

Shweta Rangari (10) is a student of class IV in Zilla Parishad Primary School
in Indrathana, a village in Maharashtra. Until recently, she didn’t have a
toilet in her house, but attending the Swachh Aadat curriculum made her
convince her father to build one. All it took was a little bit of
determination- Shweta deliberately missed school for 3-4 days, and told her
father that if he wanted her to continue pursuing her education, he would have
to construct a toilet at home. Her teachers, villagers, and the district
administration have lauded her for her efforts.

Shweta says she is proud to claim that she uses a toilet day. Earlier, it
filled her with embarrassment to be unable to fill one of the columns of the
behaviour tracker that is part of the Swachh Aadat curriculum.

**Imphal:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday exhorted scientists to extend their research from “the labs to the land” for the greater benefit of the people and said time was ripe to redefine ‘R&amp;amp;D’ as research for development of the nation. 

Addressing the inaugural session of the 105th Indian Science Congress here, he
said India has a rich tradition and a long history of both discovery and use
of science and technology.

“It is time to reclaim our rightful place among the front-line nations in this
field,” he said, calling upon the scientific community to extend its research
from “the labs to the land”.

Modi said the country has to be “future ready” in implementing technologies
vital for the growth and prosperity of the nation.

“Technology will allow far greater penetration of services such as education,
health care and banking to our citizens,” he said.

There is need, the prime minister said, to communicate our scientific
achievements to society. This, he said, will help inculcate scientific temper
among the youth.

“We have to throw open our institutions and laboratories to our children. I
call upon scientists to develop a mechanism for interaction with school-
children,” he said.

He said it was his “personal request” that scientists spend 100 hours per
annum with 100 students of classes 9 to 12 to discuss science and technology
as it could help nurture scientific temperament among the youth.

The government has set a target of 100 GW (giga watt) of installed solar power
by 2022, Modi told the gathering.

“Efficiency of solar modules currently available in the market is around 17-18

solar module, which can be produced in India at the same cost,” he asked.

He also said the government is committed to increasing the share of non-fossil
fuel based capacity in the electricity mix above 40% by 2030.

India is a leader in the multi-country Solar Alliance and in Mission
Innovation. These groupings are providing a thrust to R and D for clean
energy, the prime minister pointed out.

273,"&gt;The previous few months have seen the resignation or ouster of several editors who ran their newspapers or channels or television shows with a high degree of independence and who kept their distance from the NDA-led Narendra Modi government.

&gt;The list includes Bobby Ghosh, who quit as editor of the Hindustan Times last year, Bharat Bhushan of Catch News, Karan Thapar, whose critically acclaimed ‘To the Point’ show on Indian Today TV was not renewed, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta from the Economic and Political Weekly, Krishna Prasad and (the late) Neelabh Misra from Outlook and Outlook Hindi, and now Harish Khare from The Tribune.

&gt;R. Jagannathan quit FirstPost soon after he was forced by the website’s owners to take down a column he had written that was critical of Arun Jaitley. Praveen Swami, one of India’s most respected national security editors, quit the Indian Express in the wake of the newspaper’s refusal to run a story that was critical of the Modi government’s handling of the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. Last month, Angshukanta Chakraborty, an editor with DailyO, the online portal run by the India Today group, was sacked for refusing to delete a tweet that was critical of media houses that promote fake news.

An [**Economic and Political Weekly (EPW)** story](http://www.epw.in/journal/2002/22/civil-liberties-columns/narendra-modis-directive-press.html) from Gujarat. 


[**Narendra Modi’s Directive to the Press, 2002**](http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/2002_37/22/Narendra_Modis_Directive_to_the_Press.pdf)

&gt; In the fine tradition of the press, Basant Rawat did a service by filling from Ahmedabad a report in **The Telegraph** of May 16 which revealed:

&gt;&gt;Rattled by the bad press it has been getting, the Narendra Modi government has asked three news agencies in Ahmedabad to refurbish its image by putting out positive stories.

&gt;&gt; The agencies – PTI, UNI and the now-defunct Hindustan Samachar which still has a representative here – **have been directed to file at least five articles/features every month to highlight the government’s development activities**.

&gt;&gt; The information department’s directive has shocked the agencies. “This is unprecedented. I do not think any state government has ever issued directives like this. I have worked in several state capitals but never got such a letter from the information department”, said a UNI official.

&gt;&gt; **The letter he received yesterday said the agency will have to release all press statements ‘without fail’ issued by the state government. They will also be required to submit a list of press releases carried in different newspapers.**

&gt; **The government officials called it ‘routine’, which testifies to their lack of respect for the truth**; for the UNI official
said it was ‘unprecedented’. Note the precision – the news agencies are asked to file “at least five articles/features every month”; that is at least once a week. **They are required thereafter to act as informers on which papers printed the planted features and which consigned them to the waste-paper basket. The implication, is plain: those who comply will be rewarded with government ads and other favours, others will be punished**.

&gt; **The information official explained that the government pays the agencies for their services. “If the government wants certain stories to be released and the details about the articles they have released, I do not think there is anything wrong. It is just a mutual agreement that suits us”, the official explained.** 


&gt; **The sole sanction behind the order is the power over the public purse that vests in the government of the day. The Supreme Court has ruled that public money can be spent only for ‘public purposes’**. Government ads which
boast of its achievements, illustrated with photographs of the high and mighty, are themselves open to challenge as colourable use of public money for partisan ends.",2018-03-16 13:21:28

**Rafale deal: Loss of 36,000 crore rupees even as Army begs for money, says Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| New Delhi |

Updated: March 16, 2018 8:17 pm

Rahul Gandhi highlighted the price the BJP government paid for the fighter
jets, the figure finalised by the erstwhile UPA regime led by Manmohan Singh
for purchasing the aircraft and the amount Qatar had paid for the same.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday again trained his guns on the
government over the Rafale fighter jets deal, alleging that it had caused a
loss of Rs 36,000 crore to the state exchequer even as the Army “begs” for
more money. He also alleged that Dassault Aviation, the French company that
manufactured the fighter jets, had called the “lie” of “RM” (Raksha Mantri or
Defence Minister) Nirmala Sitharaman by releasing the price of the aircraft.
Gandhi highlighted the price the BJP government paid for the fighter jets, the
figure finalised by the erstwhile UPA regime led by Manmohan Singh for
purchasing the aircraft and the amount Qatar had paid for the same.

“Dassault called RM’s lie and released prices paid per RAFALE plane in report:
Qatar = 1319 Cr, MODI = 1670 Cr, MMS = 570 Cr. “1100 Crore per plane or 36,000
Crore i.e 10 pc of our Defence budget, in the pocket. Meanwhile, our Army begs
our Govt. for money (sic),” the Congress leader said on Twitter. Gandhi has
been attacking the BJP-led government over the defence deal, alleging that it
has caused a huge loss to the state exchequer. He has also questioned Prime
Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on the issue.

**BJP’s tally in 2019 elections may drop by 100-110 seats, says Shiv Sena after UP bypolls** 

 ______ 
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s tally may drop by 100-110 seats in the
next Lok Sabha polls in 2019, if the current trends and the results of the
recent bypolls are an indicator, ally Shiv Sena said said in Mumbai on Friday.

“The twin wins by the Samajwadi Party in BJP bastions like Gorakhpur and
Phulpur has created panic in the BJP camp even as they were busy celebrating
the party’s victory in a small state like Tripura last week,” the Sena said in
a tough edit in its mouthpieces, ‘Saamana’ (Marathi) and ‘Dopahar Ka Saamana’
(Hindi).

Though the BJP claims that by-elections do not reflect the mood of the
country, ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over, the party has lost
nearly nine seats in Lok Sabha bypolls, slashing its tally from 282 to around
272 - the halfway mark in the 543-strong Lower House, the editorial said.

“It was barely a year ago that the BJP won the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls,
creating a record by winning 325 seats. The saffron-clad Yogi Adityanath, who
has never lost the Gorakhpur seat since 1991, became the state chief minister.
So despite the huge popularity they enjoyed, why was their citadel shattered,”
the Sena wondered.

It could be said that in 2014, there was a huge “wave” of popularity and water
had blocked the eyes and ears of the masses, leading to (BJP’s) victory, but,
now the wave has receded and people can “see” everything clearly, the edit
said.

The BJP is now blaming “poor voter turnout”, “lack of enthusiasm” or “a deal
between the Samajwadi Party with Bahujan Samaj Party” for its rout in the two
critical seats in Uttar Pradesh.

“Since 2014, how many deals has the BJP entered into for power... What about
Naresh Agrawal, who was inducted in BJP with such fanfare? In Tripura, the BJP
could win only after the entire Congress and Trinamool Congress ‘merged’ with
it” the Sena pointed out.

Referring to the polls, the Sena said the SP candidates secured big margins in
both Gorakhpur and Phulpur, indicating that the people went out of the way to
defeat the BJP in both seats which were won with huge margins of two-three
lakh votes in 2014.

On the winning spree of the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar’s Jehanabad and
Araria, the Sena said some BJP leaders were living in a fool’s paradise as
they attributed it to “a sympathy wave” for the jailed RJD president Lalu
Prasad Yadav.

“Lalu is in jail for corruption... and that could be a politics of vendetta.
Despite that if he can get ‘sympathy’, then it’s a big blow to both Nitish
Kumar and Modi... The outcome has thrown down the BJP from the sky to the
ground,” the Sena said.

“Amidst all this, it is clear now, that in 2019, the BJP’s numbers will not be
280, but it will plummet by at least 100-110 seats. The elections are not
being fought in Russia, America, Canada, France or Israel, but in India. So
they (BJP) should keep their feet on the ground here,” the Sena warned.

Opposition to the Modi government has existed from the time they came to power. Do you remember the land bill that Modi government tried to change, where in it would again allow government to take over your land for pennies? Rahul Gandhi was at the forefront of fighting it, and he made sure that the opposition forced the government to back off from changing the law. Moreover, the opposition also ensured that Modi's ordinance Raj ended by getting the SC involved, and the SC judgement on this also curtailed Modi's undemocratic and dictatorial tendencies. 

&gt; During the UPA, Congress had the advantage of being the umbrella liberal party that could maintain a coalition of several varied groups. A luxury it no longer has.

Perhaps you didn't see the news about Sonia Gandhi calling an all party meeting just this month where around 20 or so political parties were invited ... and everyone attended it.

&gt; People might vote for the congress but at the centre the gandhi family mother and son duo are still the biggest congress stake holders, a fact that does not sit well with most voters.

Again a common BJP propaganda. As a vocal congress supporter (and I have never hidden that fact here) I can tell you that I vote for the Congress because of the Gandhi family. Both Mrs. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are the torch bearers and representative of the Congress ideology, and it would be a great loss to the Congress, if they were to lose them (and this is precisely what happened after Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were assassinated - without them, people believed that Congress ideology died with them). 

&gt; BJP has the advantage primarily because of its unified hindu vote bank.

There is no such thing as a ""Hindu vote bank"". If there were, Congress would have been wiped out long ago and BJP should have been winning everywhere. ",2018-03-17 00:00:47

**Centre endlessly waiting for Andhra to revert on special package: Arun Jaitley** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A day after TDP quit NDA over lack of financial support, Finance
Minister

Arun Jaitley

on Friday said the Centre was committed to giving Andhra Pradesh a special
package equivalent to a special category state and has been endlessly waiting
for the state government to revert on mechanism of receiving it.

Jaitley said the modalities of giving the special package were agreed way back
in September 2016 but the state government only in January this year suggested
a change in route of receiving funds, to which the Centre agreed but has not
heard from it ever since.

""A solution has been put on the table. It is for Andhra Pradesh to decide
whether they want the resources or they want to make an issue (out of it),"" he
told PTI here.

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which has 16 MPs in the 545-member Lok Sabha,
first pulled out its ministers from the Narendra Modi government and yesterday
decided to quit the alliance itself.

The party, which is in power in Andhra Pradesh, had been demanding greater
financial assistance to make up for the disadvantage it has been put to since
its division in 2014.

Jaitley, however, said the Centre has been fully committed to giving the
promised funds to the state and there has been no delay on its part.

He said the so-called special category status cannot be given to Andhra
Pradesh in its literal sense after implementation of the award of

14th Finance Commission

, which deals with sharing of central government's financial resources with
the states.

The constitutionally-mandated Commission gave increased share of states fund
in central taxes to 42% from 32% previously and meeting revenue deficit in
case any state needs to be extraordinarly compensated.

The minister said a special category state gets to pay just 10% share of the
money to be spent on a centrally sponsored scheme in comparison to general
category states having to pay 40%. The remaining 90% in case of special
category states and 60% in general category states is borne by the Centre.

The 30% equivalent advantage that the special category states had was agreed
to be given to Andhra Pradesh for five years. ""We found a solution on
September 16, 2016 that instead of a special category, we will give a special
package,"" he said adding the funds equivalent to 30 per cent additional
funding was to be met in some other form.

Andhra Pradesh, he said, suggested that this should come to it in form of
external aided projects wherein the repayment is 90% borne by the Centre and
10% by the state.

""We agreed,"" he said.But in January this year, Andhra Pradesh changed its
stance and said it should come via NABARD, Jaitley said adding the Centre told
the state that such funding would increase its fiscal deficit and restrict
borrowing space.

So it was suggested that a special purpose vehicle be created into which
NABARD can transfer funds. The Centre would have repaid such funds to the
extent of 90%, he said.

""On February 7 their officers said they will find out the details and come. No
one has come till now,"" he said. ""We have been literally waiting for them to
come.""

""The Centre has always been willing to give and there is no delay on our
part,"" he said. ""The changeover has been done in January by Andhra Pradesh not
by us.""

On meeting the revenue deficit faced by the state due to carving out of
Telangana, Jaitley said 14th Finance Commission has already calculated the
funds for 2015 to 2020, which the Centre will pay.

For the 10 months prior to that, the deficit can be calculated either by
taking the 2013-14 as the base or by extrapolating revenue of 2015-16. In the
first case only Rs 138 crore is left to be paid and if the second is used, Rs
1,600 crore is due. ""We have said take it,"" he said.

""We have been waiting endlessly for a response from them to resolve the
issue,"" he added.

**Banks leave worries behind, disburse Rs 1 lakh crore in 2 weeks** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: Banks have paid out about Rs 1 lakh crore in loans in the two-week
period ended March 2, belying fears that the unearthing of the

Punjab National Bank

(PNB) fraud in February could put the freeze on credit as lenders became
excessively wary. To be sure, the trend is in line with the seasonal uptick as
credit demand accelerates before the end of the fiscal year but it’s also part
of the overall picture of an economy in revival mode, experts said.

The increase is about a fifth of all loans banks disbursed in the first 11
months of FY18 when the economy was still recovering from the disruptions
caused by

demonetisation

in November 2016 and the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) in
July last year. Credit growth had been tepid for most of the fiscal year until
this latest uptrend. Banks had loaned about Rs 4 lakh crore in the 11 months
between April and mid-February.

The surge in demand for loans is a boost for the industry struggling with
sluggish credit off take. Loan demand had fallen to a five-decade low earlier
in the year as projects dried up on turning unfeasible and bankers shut their
doors amid surging

bad loans

. That spell seems to have been broken, auguring well for investment, which
has been a laggard and worryingly so for policymakers seeking to nurture
growth revival.

“I don’t think there is a credit paralysis — January-March is a high credit
growth quarter for banks,” said Ashish Parthasarthy, group head, treasury,
HDFC Bank. “We are on a normalising path and credit growth will be 11-12% when
nominal GDP is growing strong.” Non-food credit rose Rs 99,860 crore in the
February 17-March 2 period, the first reporting fortnight after the Rs
13,000-crore scam was unearthed at state-run PNB, according to the latest data
from the

Reserve Bank of India

(RBI).

This marks one of the sharpest spikes in loan growth in several quarters.
Adding to the trend was some non-funded credit, such as guarantees of certain
kinds, shifting to working capital loans, which involves cash being paid out.
“The unusually high credit offtake from banks might have been due to a
combination of working capital demand from residual GST input credit delays,
plus diversion back to banks from commercial papers and bonds due to rising
market interest rates and potentially, part of LoC/LoU (letters of
undertaking, letters of credit) support shifting to direct bank credit,” said
Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank.

Incidentally, RBI scrapped LoUs and LoCs on March 13, instruments regarded as
bank guarantees and key to the

PNB fraud

allegedly committed by jewellers

Nirav Modi

,

Mehul Choksi

, their companies and bank officials.

Before RBI move, banks had anyway clamped down on the instruments after news
of the fraud broke, so some of the credit surge could be on account of a shift
away from LoUs in the reporting fortnight, some experts said, adding the ban
could lead to a further surge in loans from banks.

LoUs and LoCs acted as guarantees for importers, which used them to borrow
from elsewhere. Funds so obtained are cheaper than working capital loans. Now
that the instruments have been scrapped, companies are likely to draw from
their working capital limits, paying high interest rates.

India’s economy grew 7.2% in the December quarter, exceeding expectations and
winning back its status as fastest-growing economy from China on the back of a
rebound in industrial activity, especially manufacturing and construction, and
an expansion in agriculture. China grew 6.8% in the quarter— and is expected
to grow at that pace for the full year.

The BJP was given an absolute majority, with their nearest rival being seven times smaller than them. This was a electoral verdict most conducive to NaMo's ""my way or the high way"" brand of politics. And what did the BJP do with this? Let's see:

- Implemented the disastrous DeMo exercise, supposedly to wipe out black money. They forced people to stand in lines for their own money instead of doing something productive with that time. 99% of the money came back as people found ways to launder black money - exactly as experts like Raghuram Rajan and others had predicted before the govt embarked on this harebrained endeavor.

- They gave the maximum number of LOUs to Nirav Modi in 2017 as per the CBI

- Made political donations anonymous. Apparently privacy is not a fundamental right for citizens but it is a right when you're bribing the BJP

- Appointed a religious fundamentalist CM of India's most populous state. Said fundamentalist was more concerned about  cows than children dying in his own town due to lack of O2 

- Took Nirav Modi to Davos as part of the delegation

- Allowed Nirav Modi and his whole family to flee the country with 11,000 Crores of money. Including Mehul Choksi or as Narendra Modi called him, ""Mehul bhai"" 

- Made it legal for parties to get funds from foreign countries *with retrospective effect*, which the BJP would only need if they had already been receiving foreign funds. 

- Appointed first an HRD minister who'd never been to college, then appointed a creationist as deputy HRD minister

- Looked the other way while the Karni Sena threatened to chop off heads, threatened school children and wreaked havoc

- Asked Muslims to leave the country

All these coalition parties will work to support their constituencies that elected them in, and so the country will take off on all directions, effectively getting nowhere.
Bjp should allow the opposition to fail. That will generate another modi wave, when people realise that they did vote for an alternative, but that alternative didnt work. Lets settle this thing once and for all !

**Opinion: BJP's Gorakhpur Defeat Is Poetic Justice** 

 ______ 
As I asked for a

_paan_

, he looked at me and said jovially

_""Anth ki shuruwaat ho gayi hai_

(this is the beginning of the end)"". He did not say a word. Neither did I ask.
He was smiling. We both understood. It was around 2 in the afternoon today.
The results for the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by-elections were coming in with
the BJP trailing in Gorakhpur and Phulpur and also in Araria, Bihar. Elections
were held because the Chief Minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath had given up his
Lok Sabha seat from Gorakhpur and his deputy, Keshav Prasad Maurya, from
Phulpur. Araria was vacant due to the death of Mohammed Taslimuddin from the
RJD. The results are shocking. Just a year ago, the BJP had recorded a
historic win in UP. That was a victory which belied many myths. Enthusiasts
had then declared that the opposition should start preparing for the 2024
parliamentary elections because 2019 was a done deal for the BJP. Now, the
loss will write a new script, not only for UP and Bihar, but also for 2019.

Here are 10 big take-aways:

1\. Modi is undoubtedly the most popular leader in the country. He loves to
lead from the front and is always in campaign mode. After the consecutive
losses in Delhi and Bihar in 2015, it was assumed that his popularity is on
the decline, but he proved that wrong with massive victories in Assam, UP,
Uttarakhand, Tripura. Gujarat in December was a scare. But with by-election
losses in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and now in UP and Bihar, he should worry.
Now I can stick my neck out and say he is not the same phenomenon that he was
in 2014.

2\. After the Bihar election results, the BJP at the centre changed gears,
development took a back seat and the

_Hindutva_

agenda once again began to dominate the national discourse. The economy took a
hit and jobless growth started troubling the masses, but the BJP, instead of
taking corrective measures, allowed the fringe to control the mainstream. Cow
slaughter,

_""Love Jihad""_

, killings of rationalists, intolerance,

_""Padmaavat""_

, nationalism, Kashmir and Pakistan occupied the debate space. The BJP did not
realise that it had got a massive mandate to make India better, to satisfy the
aspirations of the new India which wants development and development only. The
warning from UP is audible for all to hear.

3\. UP has experimented with Mandal politics since 2002. The state gave
opportunities to Mulayam Singh Yadav in 2002, Mayawati in 2007 and to Akhilesh
Yadav in 2012, but they frittered away the chance. In 2017, people wanted
change. The BJP offered itself as an alternative. The state believed them, but
Yogi Adityanath's appointment as Chief Minister was a rude shock; he is a
practitioner of communal politics. This was a betrayal of the people's trust.
The BJP's loss in Gorakhpur is poetic justice. Yogi had won this seat five
times in a row. The BJP has lost Gorakhpur when Modi is PM at the centre, Yogi
is leading the state. The message can't be clearer.

4\. Yogi in his initial days was projected as the next poster boy of RSS and

_Hindutva_

. It was said that Yogi would be Modi's successor and he would take over from
him in 2024. Yes, he was being discussed as the next Prime minister. Will

_Hindutva_

warriors still want to bet on him? Message - politics should be left to
politicians, states should go to statesmen and religion should reside inside

_maths_

.

5\. In a democracy, numbers should rule. 80% Hindus are Bahujans, who find
themselves at the bottom of the pyramid, who are referred to as ""foot born"".

_Hindutva_

caters to the top 20% of the upper caste. Once the leaders of the Bahujans -
OBC and Dalits - joined hands, the game was up for

_Hindutva_

warriors. Let us not forget that after the demolition of the Babri Masjid,
Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kanshi Ram formed a coalition in 1993 and the BJP lost
the assembly elections despite unprecedented communal polarisation. So
Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati coming together is significantly bad news for Modi
and for the champions of

_""Hindu Rashtra""_

.

6\. The loss in Araria, Bihar, underlines the limits of vindictive politics.
Lalu Yadav and his family are being hounded like never before. Lalu Yadav is
in jail. But this has created sympathy for him and has consolidated the OBC
and Muslims behind his party, the RJD. His son and political heir, Tejashwi
Yadav, has emerged as a leader in his own right.

7\. The 2015 Bihar assembly elections were a victory of Mandal forces over the
politics of

_Kamandal_

. Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad are the pioneers of Mandal politics. When they
decided to come together, on the surface it might have seemed a combination of
two caste leaders but in reality it was the consolidation of OBC votes opposed
to the politics of

_Hindutva_

. A strategic alliance with the minority community made this combination
lethal. Nitish Kumar shaking hands with the BJP did not go down well with the
backward class. I sincerely doubt that Nitish Kumar will gain anything in the
company of the BJP.

8\. The 2019 parliamentary elections are a year away. The opposition is still
in disarray. Sonia Gandhi is trying hard to get all of them on a platform. The
dinner hosted by her last night is case in point. But the message from the
electorate is loud and clear. The Congress can't defeat the BJP on its own. A
larger alliance is needed. If Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati can forget their
past rivalry, then why can't the others? In the present scenario, parties can
fight only if they survive, and they can only survive if they are together.

9\. Politics in the Indian context is very complex - and very simple too. It
is complex due to its diversity, and simple due to its underlined unity. In
UP, it was pure arithmetic that won. The opposition has to create the magic of
social-engineering at the pan-India level.

10\. Never underestimate the Machiavellian Modi. If he can bounce back after
his defeat in Delhi and Bihar and win Assam, if he can overcome demonetisation
to win UP, if he can survive the scare of Gujarat and deliver Tripura to the
BJP, then he can still turn the tables on the opposition in 2019.

I wanted to tell the

_paanwala_

that this is just the beginning, not the end. There is still a year to go.
Anything can happen.

**BJP spreads hate, Congress spreads love: Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Congress president

Rahul Gandhi

today accused the

Narendra Modi

government of spreading hatred and anger, and said the Congress was the only
party that would take the country forward by fostering an environment of amity
and love.

In his brief inaugural address at the 84th

Congress Plenary

session, Gandhi said the Congress's hand (election symbol) is the only one
that would unite India and take it forward, and reminded partymen that it
followed the ideology of love.

The difference between the BJP and the Congress was that while they spread
anger and hatred, ""we spread love and brotherhood"", he said.

He also said that the Congress party under him would take the seniors and the
youths together as the tradition of the Congress party was to embrace change
without forgetting its past and legacy.

""If the youths have to take the Congress forward, it cannot be done without
the experience the party veterans. My task is to be take them together,"" he
said.

Representatives of the party have fought hard to keep the Congress ideology
alive. Senior leaders of the Congress will guide the youths and take the party
forward, he added.

Taking a jibe at the present dispensation, Gandhi said that crores of youths
in the country, looking up to Modi, are not finding any anything as there were
no jobs.

""The country is tired of what is happening under the current government. Only
the Congress party can show the way and heal divisions in the nation,"" he
said.

""Come what may, this country belongs to everyone, every religion, every caste
and every person and the Congress party is for everyone and we will not leave
anyone behind,"" he added.

The two-day plenary session is being attended by senior Congress leaders
including former party president

Sonia Gandhi

and former prime minister

Manmohan Singh

**Rajnath Singh slams Pakistan for abetting, sponsoring terrorism from its soil**

being played with and those who preach jihad to them, must first look inward
before corrupting these children. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

**New Delhi:** Speaking at the second day of the _CNN News 18_ Rising India Summit, Union home minister Rajnath Singh, on Saturday, not only addressed terrorism plaguing Jammu and Kashmir, but also came down heavy on Pakistan for abetting and sponsoring terrorism from its soil. 

While Singh stressed on India’s intention is to establish good relations with
all its neighbouring countries, he stated that Pakistan refused to comply.

“Terrorism is a global phenomenon and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been
successful in bringing the international community on board with us. Today,
The United States of America is at least condemning and warning Pakistan to
stop sheltering Pakistan otherwise funding will be stopped. In Pakistan,
United Nations designated terrorists are being given political legitimacy.
Hafiz Saeed (Lashkar-e-Toiba chief) will form a political party, contest
elections and sit in the parliament, and the Haqqani network too is being
given legitimacy, whereas they have killed hundreds,” Rajnath Singh said.

Singh’s statements come in the wake of 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks mastermind
Hafiz Saeed’s decision to launch his party’s manifesto on 23 March.

Saeed’s newly launched Milli Muslim League (MML) is all set to contest the
Pakistan general elections later this year.

On 8 March, the Islamabad high court set aside the decision of the Election
Commission of Pakistan to reject the application of the MML for registration
as a political party.

At the same time however, with Kashmir being the primary bone of contention
between India and Pakistan, Rajnath Singh added that, even though the
country’s security forces were keeping vigil along the northern borders,
Kashmir would always remain a part of India.

“We want a solution to the Kashmir problem and interlocutor Dineshwar Sharma
has been made the special representative. He is open to dialogues with whoever
wants to talk. Let me tell you, Kashmir was ours, it is ours and will always
remain ours. The Kashmiri youth belong to us, but their lives are being played
with and those who preach jihad to them, must first look inward before
corrupting these children,” Singh added.

With regard to India’s internal security issues, Singh also added that while
Naxalism continued to be a major problem in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE)
affected states, with the effort put in by India’s security forces, from “more
than 3000 incidents of LWE violence in the 1980s, we have brought it down to
less than 1000 incidents now, with key focus being the development initiatives
in the LWE regions.”

While Singh added that India had been recognised as the fastest growing
economy at the global forum, the Central government was also fighting to
minimise corruption, with the government all set to introduced merit-based
loan to prevent banking frauds.

Singh’s statements come as the country’s banking system has been grappling
with the Rs12,636 crore fraud that hit Punjab National Bank (PNB), with
jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi as the prime accused for fraudulently
procuring Letters of Understanding (LoU) to obtain the loans.

“Transparency in system has been our endeavour and even though I don’t want to
name people involved in banking frauds who have fled the country, nobody has
noticed that our government has been successful at exposing that fraud. To
stop the rise of Non-performing assets (NPA), we have stopped providing loans
based on recommendations and should instead be given on the basis of merit,”
he said.

With key focus on defaulters and fugitives such as Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi
and Mehul Choksi, Rajnath Singh also added that the Centre had taken various
steps to crack down on defaulters through the Fugitive Economic Offenders
bill, “that would stop such people from fleeing and if they have left then all
their property and assets in India will be seized.”

Singh also added that even though the Benami property transaction provision
act has been in place since 1988, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
government under Narendra Modi had made the effort to notify the same.

335,"Kejriwal has a long way to go before he can think of becoming PM.

While I am pro-AAP, they need to win a couple of states, establish ground-level machinery, prove an ability to govern, come up with a solid cadre and a solid leadership, decide on an ideology before they can dream of being a real force at national level. Right now the general consensus is that he's a joke.

Maybe if things go their way, they can have all this by 2029, and the party (and Kejriwal) will mature by then.

Right now, AAP is in a very precarious situation - one wrong move and Modi will ensure they don't live to fight another election. Kejriwal doesn't have the luxury of dissent within his party.",2018-03-17 15:13:28
336,Modi didn't apologize like a coward. ,2018-03-17 16:05:52
337,"You have to get the facts right. He took loans for his business not like Nirav Modi whose sole intention was to defraud. There are lakhs of businessmen who take loans, go bankrupt and are declared insolvent. Calling these as robbery is plain naive. Though the act of fleeing to shy away from the punishment is obviously unethical but he had the connections and resources to get out the trouble and any person including me would have done that.",2018-03-17 16:08:04
338,"Rahul gandhi = pappu 

Modi = scammers",2018-03-17 16:16:35
339,"&gt;But crossing this new threshold, is it good politics for Kejriwal? Speaking to a cross-section of analysts, and travelling across many Delhi localities listening to people’s responses, it becomes evident he is very much in the game. The voters speak of the demonstrable effects of policy—on water, education, health, power—and the experts, even disenchanted former associates, seem keen to offer a qualified defence, perhaps as a reaction to the much bigger forces that have trapped AAP in a long siege.Three years after, Nandy reassesses Kejriwal carefully. “He’s more of a politician now—shrewder—in the way he has purged the party of opponents. The earlier stalwarts of AAP are gone now; that shows his political skills. The earlier Kejriwal didn’t have these skills,” Nandy concedes, speaking to Outlook. But he adds: “On the whole, Kejriwal’s appeal is intact. This is because, leave all things aside, he’s still not seen as a typical politician.” Nandy traces this through the present impasse, citing how “other parties are uncomfortable with AAP”. And why they behave, despite Delhi being a small state, “as if he’s a major threat, using the bureaucracy and all central powers against him”. For Nandy, the reason goes back to his original formulation. “Because they see him as a usurper. He’s still an outsider holding out the same promise, of remaining one. Otherwise, I don’t see a politically valid reason for so much desperation among its rivals.”

&gt;Inept attempts, perhaps, that only confirm their amateur status and only a side story. The main script, as Nandy also hints at, is the unceasing artillery fire AAP has been facing from the ruling BJP at the Centre. This is the context in which it expects—and probably receives—sympathy. “I’m sure there have been efforts to break or split the party by its rivals,” Nandy says. AAP spokesperson Adarsh Shastri confirms this sense of being unfairly targeted: “The poor feel AAP is not being allowed to function. They feel it’s being victimised even in the office of profit issue. Delhi’s educated classes know we are not the problem-creators but they say, ‘why doesn’t AAP just sort it out with the government’.” The big change, he says, is that Modi was once seen as an achie­ver and AAP as a fighter. “Now all, rich or poor, think Modi is doing nothing, while we are delivering.” There are reports that the BJP is aware of AAP’s continued popularity as well, and so is unwilling to escalate the crisis

&gt;But AAP leaders say they are on top of the situation, that their strongest supporters in Delhi slums, among the city’s poorest, understand the party. They feel their opponents are mostly status quoists resistant to change: “Five hundred times we have been written off by analysts but our supporters don’t feel that way. We always seem to come out stronger,” says AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha. “We have walked the talk on development. We are in fact expanding, going into Haryana, consolidating in Punjab, preparing for Lok Sabha. It’s Modi’s anti-corruption agenda that has gone bust, especially after the Nirav Modi case. Even on anti-corruption we have done much better than most parties,” says Chadha.

Despite resulting to nitpicking to find faults in AAP's model of governance..The author is forced to acknowledge the fact that AAP's support on the ground remains intact.",2018-03-17 16:27:02
340,"&gt;1. Modi is undoubtedly the most popular leader in the country. He loves to lead from the front and is always in campaign mode. After the consecutive losses in Delhi and Bihar in 2015, it was assumed that his popularity is on the decline, but he proved that wrong with massive victories in Assam, UP, Uttarakhand, Tripura. Gujarat in December was a scare. But with by-election losses in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and now in UP and Bihar, he should worry. 

Popular leader? Only 31% of the people voted him in 2014.Kya foonke hai baithe ho Ashutoshji?

&gt;. After the Bihar election results, the BJP at the centre changed gears, development took a back seat and the Hindutva agenda once again began to dominate the national discourse. The economy took a hit and jobless growth started troubling the masses, but the BJP, instead of taking corrective measures, allowed the fringe to control the mainstream

Development was never the agenda..Hindutva was the sole key to winning.There are no fringe elements in this country, that chutni sena was always mainstream.

&gt;The opposition is still in disarray. Sonia Gandhi is trying hard to get all of them on a platform. The dinner hosted by her last night is case in point. But the message from the electorate is loud and clear. The Congress can't defeat the BJP on its own. A larger alliance is needed. If Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati can forget their past rivalry, then why can't the others? In the present scenario, parties can fight only if they survive, and they can only survive if they are together.

Why doesn't your own party becomes a part of an alliance instead of blaming others? Everyone else is burying their past to get together and defeat the BJP while you are still trying to overcome your internal conflicts

&gt;10. Never underestimate the Machiavellian Modi. If he can bounce back after his defeat in Delhi and Bihar and win Assam, if he can overcome demonetisation to win UP, if he can survive the scare of Gujarat and deliver Tripura to the BJP, then he can still turn the tables on the opposition in 2019.

**Nobel-winner Paul Krugman warns India story could end with mass unemployment** 

 ______ 
Paul Krugman, the American economist who won a

Nobel Prize

in 2008, has warned that

India

could end up with huge mass unemployment if it does not grow its

manufacturing

sector.

""There is this concept called artificial intelligence that you should be wary
of. In future, while diagnosis may be outsourced to a doctor in India, it
could also go to a firm based on artificial intelligence. Things like this
could be a cause for worry for Indian services sector,"" Krugman said while
speaking at a News 18 event.

""Japan is no longer a superpower because its working-age population declined,
and

China

is looking the same. In Asia, India could take the lead but only if it also
develops its manufacturing sector, not only the services one,” he said.

“India’s lack in the manufacturing sector could work against it, as it doesn't
have the jobs essential to sustain the projected growth in demography. You
have to find jobs for people,” he said.

On the other hand, India can also ride the next wave of globalisation on its
demographic dividend. ""India's growth story is quite unique. Services
propelling growth to an extent that hasn't been seen anywhere else in the
world and the possibilities of service globalisation has only just begun.
Globalisation of service trade has a huge potential. That's one reason to be
especially hopeful of India’s progress. It has the first-mover's advantage
here,"" he said.

Krugman said India's growth story was incredible but it never got the
attention it deserved because China hogged the world's attention. ""Rest of the
world is not paying as much attention to India as it should. If China wasn't
around, we would have said what an incredible story India is. Quadrupling of
GDP per capita in a very short time, becoming a better place to do business
etc.""

Krugman said India's growth story would continue to improve at a higher rate.
""India's working-age population is projected to grow substantially. Countries
across the world from Japan to Italy to China are suffering or are about to
suffer from lack of manpower to propel their growth.""

He said there were still huge parts of India that had yet to realise their
full potential. ""Prime Minister Modi talked about bringing electricity to
parts of India that have never seen it. When such a plan is fulfilled you
obviously will see a huge boost to your

economy

.""

**Not privatizing PSU banks Modi govt’s biggest failing: Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma** 

 ______ 
Sharma said India is entering a critical period where the global economy is
doing well, but the country has not been able to fully participate in the
massive global economic revival seen in the past 18 months or so. Photo:

**New Delhi:** Failing to reform India’s banking system by privatizing the public sector banks has been the biggest shortcoming of the Narendra Modi government, Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets and chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management said on Saturday. 

Speaking at the Rising India Summit, Sharma said lack of banking sector
reforms is the real big problem that has not been fixed in India. “Banking
system is the archery; it lies at the heart of what a nation can do. It is the
single biggest shortcoming of the last few years,” he said.

When asked by the moderator whether this is the biggest missed opportunity by
the Narendra Modi government where it could have utilized its political
majority it enjoys driving through privatization of the public sector banks,
Sharma answered in the affirmative.

Sharma said every country needs a few public sector banks to meet some social
objective, but there is no country like India where the figure is so lopsided.
“In India, two third of the assets are with the public sector banks. This is
the highest in any democratic country in the world. The average across
emerging markets is one third. It’s not about public versus private, it’s
about a balance,” he added.

Sharma said all incremental economic activity such as the massive retail
lending, credit cards and trade finance is happening through private sector
banking in India. “The banking system is privatized but it is happening with a
huge cost where the public sector banks are not only destroyed in value but it
is also choking the economic recovery,” he said, terming the phenomenon
“privatization by maligning neglect”.

Giving examples of Italy and the US, Sharma said in major economies of the
world until the banking system was fixed, it was very difficult for those
economies to go back to their full potential.

Sharma however said the single biggest risk for India in 2018 is that we have
a regulatory overkill. “Many public sector banks are getting completely frozen
to lend. The side effects are that the access to credit is going to be
directed more and more towards the companies with established credentials.
When you have this kind of credit environment, it is the small and medium size
companies which get hurt the most, when risk aversion sets through because a
cost of making a bad loan is now almost like a criminal offence. This is what
India has to be careful about,” he added.

Dishing out an interesting statistics, Sharma said since 2014, 23,000
millionaires have left India. In 2017, 7,000 millionaires left this
country—the largest number in recent times—compared to 4,000 in 2016. “In
absolute terms, this is still behind China. But as a share of total
millionaires living in this country, this is the largest compared to any
nation in the world,” he added.

Sharma said some may some may say this is a good thing as India is driving
away the most corrupt from the country, but there is a side effect. “At the
end of the day, you need your own domestic people to invest in this country.
Foreign investment is needed, but it is the domestic investors who make a
nation going forward,” he added.

Sharma said India is entering a critical period where the global economy is
doing well, but the country has not been able to fully participate in the
massive global economic revival seen in the past 18 months or so.

Sharma said more than the growth disconnect with the developed world, India
has to be more worried about the employment disconnect where unemployment is
at a 40 year low in the developed world whereas, India keeps debating about
lack of enough jobs.

“If you look at the success stories whether Japan, China or Taiwan, they all
exported their way to prosperity by producing low end manufacturing goods
where you get huge amount of employment growth as well. To say that we have
missed the bus in this regard may not be correct because in our own
neighbourhood, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam have picked up the low end
manufacturing after China vacated it. For that we need to improve the
infrastructure that we provide and the labour law that we have in this
country,” he added.

Session (Source: INC)

UPA chairperson and former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Saturday launched a
scathing attack on the ruling BJP-led central government, accusing it of
weakening and ignoring the social welfare schemes implemented during the
previous dispensation. “Today, I feel disappointed and sad that Modi govt is
weakening UPA’s welfare schemes,” she said while delivering her speech at the
84th Congress Plenary Session.

Terming the Narendra Modi-led BJP government as ‘arrogant’, the 71-year-old
stated that the ruling government left no stone unturned to destroy the
Congress in the last four years. “But Congress has never cowered down and it
will never cower down,” Sonia stated emphatically.

PM Modi’s promises of combating corruption, ensuring inclusive development
were all ‘dramebazi’ and a trick to grab power, the Congress leader alleged.
“Congress is fighting the tyrannical Modi Govt. People have begun to realise
that the promises made by the BJP in 2014 were hollow,” she said while giving
a clarion call to the partymen to be ready for any kind of sacrifice to
strengthen the party and to make the county free from discrimination, vendetta
politics and arrogance.

She further said the country witnessed its highest economic growth under the
tutela ge of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. “Under the leadership of
former PM Manmohan Singh, the economy of this country flourished. Our
government formed policies which lifted millions of people from poverty. And
today, the Modi government is weakening these policies,” she said.

The Congress party is presently at its lowest ebb with Rahul Gandhi being
entrusted with the task of revitalising the grand old party, which remains in
power in just three states. On the other hand, the BJP now controls 21 of the
29 states following the landslide victory in the recently-concluded assembly
elections in Tripura, which was once an impregnable citadel of the Left Front.

said. ****

“Wherever there is a non-Congress govt, our friends are taking a stand against
anarchy and violence there and continuing with their work, braving all of it.
It is Congress Party which takes stand against injustice and raises it voice
against it,” she said , adding that her party was making efforts to win back
the trust of the people and would work with like-minded parties to oust the
BJP.

Sonia also congratulated her son Rahul Gandhi for assuming the role of
Congress President at a “very challenging time”. “The party’s victory will be
the nation’s victory, it will be the victory for each one of us. Congress is
not a political term, it is a movement,” she said.

“It is the beginning of a new chapter, the challenges we are facing are not
usual ones. We need to make an India free of corruption and vendetta, under
President Rahul Gandhi, let us pledge that we will make all efforts to to do
this,” she concluded.

&gt;&gt;Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday launched an all-out attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that his pre-poll promises of combating corruption and ensuring inclusive development were “only dramebazi’ and a trick to grab power.

Gandhi, in her address at the 84th Congress Plenary Session, gave a clarion call to the party leaders to be ready for any kind of sacrifice to strengthen the party and to make the county free from discrimination, vendetta politics and arrogance.

She called upon them to forcefully fight against the challenges posed by the present dispensation and asked them to mount a struggle to free the country from the fear of power.

“The slogans of ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’ and ‘na khaoonga, na khaane doonga’ are only and only dramebazi (drama) and a trick to grab power,” she said, referring to Modi’s promises of inclusive development and corruption-free governance.

“Those who want to throw the very identity of the Congress party out of the country do not know how much people love them.

“There is only one priority today and that is how to make Congress party stronger. Congress is not just a party, but an idea several years ahead of its time,” Gandhi said.

She also urged the party members to extend all support to the new party chief and her son Rahul Gandhi who had taken over the reigns in “such difficult times”. ",2018-03-17 18:52:27

347,"Could you please, without searching for an internet definition, tell me what ""Racist"" means to you ? Because this ""being racist by nature"" thing doesn't seem right at all. Kids between 10-15 don't act/think in a racist manner. Think about new borns. Its not in their nature.

Why though ? Why are they not ? This is because the idea that you could discriminate someone by colour can only stem up if you hear of or know that people across the world (a very small population) carry out such acts.

It can only stem up if the idea of racism is ever thrusted onto someone. Its like how a baby learns to walk. Unless you know that there is a possibility, individually, you wouldn't ever think about it. Its similar to how a gesture you carry out in your country could be offensive to someone in some other country. Until you found out, you didn't know.

The fact that racism exists is itself thrusted onto you by the media you read/listen/watch. Thanks to the number of years the internet has existed, you have enough content to support that bias. If you were to never know that at some point a certain group of people were racist to another group of people, you wouldn't blame the outcome of some situation ""X"" to be cause of racist reasons.

Human beings, and our entire intertwined life and its rules, are new to everyone. We don't know the rules yet! In the process of trying to figure it all out we end up creating pools of kinds of people and keep throwing stereotypes around to satisfy the bias.

&gt; We left casteism alone for a few thousand years and look what became of that

Oh no we didn't leave it alone, at all! Laws were written, and implemented, and we have seen immense improvement since then, it is clearly visible, all around you. Do not pull up villages and minorities. They love being within their comfort zone of following age old traditions due to societal boundaries, and one small news of them being rather uncivilised and illogical ignites a good percentage of the urban educated youth. A useless cycle of hate. Those villagers will get out of their hell in time, but its got to wait, why ? because no one takes the initiative to educate them and implement modern ideas and thought process into their daily lives.

Casteism now, like slavery, is prevalent in a different form. Its Classism now. Do you think that restaurant owner wouldn't provide a table to say Ambani ? Modi ? Gandhi ? name other famous Indians. The answer is yes he/she would definitely provide a killer table for them. Is that owner racist now ? nope. He is classist. 

Classism, is a part and parcel of capitalism, and there's nothing wrong about it. Some people work hard/fraud harder and make money and kudos to them for it. This has created levels in society, and they sit in your mind, unconsciously. You want it abolished ? You've got to stop thinking about it, you've got to stop acknowledging it ? Why ? Cause you've got to be the change you wish to see. If you keep beating the bush saying ""ah thats racist, ah he's a bigot"" then its just going to continue that way. Stop pointing it out and instead move towards avenues (which are available in the order of millions) that support your views. You will see a beautiful world around you, that doesn't get you pumped up in anger/disgust/sorrow every now and then. A Billion such productive minds, being the change, will automatically shower the change on society. ",2018-03-17 19:47:28
348,"&gt; it's still essential to give a balancing power bloc, especially in anticipation of the demographic change

That's fair. I agree that the balance of LS seats is already heavily skewed towards two states of UP and Bihar, any restructuring based on updated population numbers will make things worse.

&gt; How come all the states that opposed GST are not moving in this direction?

So how it works is that the the limits to the power of taxation are defined by the constitution.

Both centre and the states are entitled to tax any transaction within their territories (territory = all India for Union govt.) 

All the 101st constitutional amendment describes is how states and centre will levy GST and divide revenues.

Nowhere does 101st amendment say that the states will no longer have the power to charge other taxes.

This is not a clever loophole that I or someone else found after the amendment was passed. This was a conscious decision to get the states onboard - Indian states have a certain degree of sovereignty under the federal structure, and no state would have agreed to give up their most crucial power of all, that of taxation.

All state finance ministers along with the Union Finance Minister collectively take decisions in the GST council. This is why consensus inside the council is very important - states can rebel and withdraw, and if enough states do that GST will be a failure. Modi or Arun Jaitley can not unilaterally take decisions in the GST Council.

To be totally clear, the Centre charges a CGST on every transaction, and there is nothing the states can do to prevent that from being levied. But they have the complete power to remove SGST and replace it with a local sales/VAT tax. Or keep SGST and charge additional taxes on top of it.

I realized this when TN decided to levy an additional entertainment tax on top of GST on movie tickets, and they are legally perfectly within their rights to do so: http://www.financialexpress.com/entertainment/tamil-nadu-theatres-gst-relief-to-tn-film-makers-govt-gives-nod-to-raise-ticket-price/885956/

&gt; we push for full south Asian common language

If we could magically become one homogenous people, so many problems would be solved.

Fortunately or unfortunately, we are a spectacular hotbed of diversity. It took the European ethnic groups two world wars and centuries of conflicts to achieve equilibrium. We were knit together by a bunch of optimistic men and women in late 1940s. We have survived (and occasionally thrived, I daresay) despite people predicting the collapse of Indian Union every elections since Independence. It is for this reason that I believe India is the greatest social experiment in the history of civilizations, and its integrity is worth fighting for, if only to prove the naysayers wrong.",2018-03-17 20:39:20

**Maharashtra Farmers ""Reclaim"" Land Bought By Nirav Modi Firm: Report** 

 ______ 
Farmers ploughed part of the land, a symbolic move to reclaim possession

**New Delhi: **

Claiming that a firm owned by celebrity jeweller Nirav Modi, the main accused
in a multi-crore bank fraud who has quit India, had acquired their land at
throwaway prices, a group of farmers today ""reclaimed"" 250 acres in Ahmednagar
district of Maharashtra today, according to news agency PTI.

Around 200 farmers, including women, who arrived in bullock carts at the land
in Khandala village, ploughed a part of it using tractors -- a symbolic move
of reclaiming possession.

The protesting farmers, who carried the national flags besides photographs of
Mahatma Gandhi and Dr BR Ambedkar, raised slogans against Nirav Modi who faces
allegations of defrauding state-run Punjab National Bank to the tune of over
Rs 13,000 crore.

The land is among the properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate as a
part of its probe against Modi who has fled the country, said a farmer
activist, according to the PTI report.

Shouting slogans against the billionaire designer, who is being probed by

Sangram', a local farmers' organisation.

""The land was acquired by Nirav Modi's company in 2013. Farmers were paid
between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 per acre though the prevailing market rate was
Rs 2 lakh per acre,"" said a farmer.

The protesters also voiced their disillusionment against the banking system,
alleging that while farmers had to struggle hard to get loans, people like
Nirav Modi got it quite easily.

""When we seek loans, banks are not willing to give beyond Rs 10,000 but Nirav
Modi got crores of rupees. Why is that,"" asked another protester.

&gt; In spite of a powerful section of the Indian media always highlighting the country’s slow and tedious process to buy arms from foreign manufacturers, **India has been the largest arms purchaser in the world not only for the past five years, but also from the beginning of this century.** Since 2000, according to SIPRI data, India has brought arms worth $46.8 billion compared with China’s $35 billion. Pakistan’s buying of any foreign military hardware becomes a sensational news in India. However, since 2000, Pakistan’s total purchase of arms from foreign market is only $14.4 billion.  

&gt; For the first time since 1970s, India is seriously worried over the possibility of armed conflict with China. The Modi government’s signing of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) with the US, boycotting of China’s Belt and Road Forum (BRF) meeting and whimsical decision for an unnecessary standoff at Doklam have not only made China an open enemy, but have also given incentives to Beijing to not bond further with Islamabad as well as other key neighbors of India.

He inspires me. So you are wrong.

&gt; Part of the problem with India's political system right now is that we don't have a strong enough opposition to fight the BJP.

It's a common BJP propaganda that they don't have an ""opposition"" and are invincible. 

From the time Modi took over, the opposition have given him a very hard time and kept his dictatorial tendency in check. 

A good example is the UPA land bill that he tried to change so that he could snatch away our lands again and pay us pittance for it, to give it away to his corporate buddies. Rahul Gandhi led the opposition against it and Modi had to back off when he realised how strong the opposition was. They also ended Modi's undemocratic ""ordinance"" rule by taking the battle to the SC who laid out strict guidelines on how ordinances can be used. 

Similarly with the GST, the Congress' relentless attacks on it forced the Modi government to reduce the GST tax and introduce reforms in it.

&gt; People would rather vote for Modi again than give RG a chance,

The very fact that Modi and BJP have been reduced to 272 seats from the 282 they won indicate how successful the opposition has been in convincing the public about how bad Modi's government is. If a few more by-polls become inevitable the stable BJP government may soon become an NDA alliance government again. 

Even in the recent UP by-polls, where they are in power, the BJP lost a seat that they had previously won 5 times! To add insult to injury, this was the seat vacated by the current BJP chief minister! **So much for people preferring Modi or Yogi or BJP over the opposition** ... ",2018-03-18 00:57:12

Again, false. Rahul Gandhi is the reason Congress will get votes in 2019. Rahul is a Gandhi. There's a reason why Congress has made him the President. A sizable portion of Congress' core vote base is because of Rahul being a Gandhi.

&gt; Who called Sonia Gandhi a pig? Who called Shashi Tharoor's wife 50 crore ki girlfriend? Rahul hasn't insulted anyone personally like this. I'd rather have him instead of Modi.

Sure, Modi has made such statements, and I am not defending him here. Modi is on a sticky wicket right now, and it's the perfect opportunity for the opposition to strike gold. Unfortunately, whatever RG says, people think that Modi is better than him. I wish RG was smarter, sharper, and has better ideas but he always come across as a clown to most people. And that's why Modi may win 2019 again.

**On Bihar Man Beheading, Sushil Kumar Modi Countered By His Own** 

 ______ 
Union minister Giriraj Singh accused local police of misleading the state
government on the beheading

**PATNA: **

An attempt by the Darbhanga administration to

link the beheading of a 60-year-old man

to a property dispute is incorrect, two senior Bihar BJP leaders said on
Saturday, contradicting the claims of the local police and

Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.

""The dispute that escalated (and led to the murder) had started due to this
chowk being named Modi Chowk,"" Bihar BJP president Nityanand Rai told
reporters after visiting Darbhanga, 150 km north of Bihar capital Patna, on
Saturday.

Ramchandra Yadav, 60, was beheaded by a group of around 50 men, who attacked
his family and killed him when he tried to intervene. His son Tej Narayan had
linked the attack to a board they had put up, renaming one of the main
intersections after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had claimed members of
the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal workers were involved.

The district police has said three persons had been arrested in this case but
called the attempt by the victim's family to link it to renaming a town square
after PM Modi was a publicity stunt.

Sushil Kumar Modi, the Deputy Chief Minister, had made a similar point in a
tweet last night..

""Totally false that the murder in Darbhanga case was due to naming Modi Chowk.
It was a case of land dispute. The board was put long back, murder has nothing
to do with board,"" Sushil Modi tweeted on Friday night.

But Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who also met the Yadav family, accused the
police of trying to hide the facts of the case. He said the police ""did not
allow the truth to reach the government"".

""I don't know why the police want to hide the facts... but the dead man's wife
told me that when they were threatened by the police when they mentioned the
Modi board,"" Mr Singh said.

Local BJP workers had held a protest against the killing but police officers
had tried to play down the sensational attack.

Neither Nityanand Rai nor Giriraj Singh referred to the tweet but only
statements attributed to district police officers.

__ Comments

Nityanand Rai said it was possible that there had been a pending land dispute
between the two sides.

""But that case has nothing to do with this attack... That is an older issue,""
the Bihar BJP president said, promising to help the family get justice.

**How Yogi Adityanath's Citadel Fell: Decoding BJP's Gorakhpur Bypoll Loss** 

 ______ 
**Gorakhpur: **

In the villages of Pipraich, one of the five assembly segments in the
Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, lie the clues to the

BJP's shock bypoll defeat.

In the recent bypolls, the BJP candidate's lead over his Samajwadi Party rival
was only 243 votes in the segment, far smaller than the nearly 40,000 lead the
BJP had in Pipraich over the collective vote share of the Samajwadi Party
(SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Peace Party in 2014.

Many men and women in Nayya Paar, one of the 413 booths in Pipraich, were fans
of

Yogi Adityanath

, who is also the head priest of the Gorakhnath temple, and Prime Minister
Narendra Modi. They say they had voted for the BJP in 2014 but this time they
switched loyalties.

""We used to run around baba (Yogi Adityanath) when he came to Nayya Paar, we
would take a bullet for him, he was holy,"" said Girish Bhardwaj, a local
resident. Now, he alleges that the chief minister doesn't heed the complaints
of the poor when he visits, choosing to meet richer residents instead. ""Baba
kicked us, Modi threw us out, what can we do? How do we back those who do not
support us?""

Many women of the village had also shifted their vote from the BJP to the SP.
And demonetisation was clearly an issue for them.

""Baba and Modi made people throw away so much money. If they had given that
money to the poor to build a shelter and live somewhere, it would have been so
good,"" said Madhuri Devi, a resident of Nayya Paar. ""But no, not to the poor,
burn it, throw it in the pond, but Gorakhnath baba didn't support the poor.""

The social dynamics created by the electoral understanding between the SP and
BSP was also at work here.

NDTV spoke with members of the Nishad community, from the boatman caste that
the candidate fielded by the SP belongs to, as well as Dalits, the BSP's core
base.

In 2014, a section of the Nishads and Dalits had voted for the BJP; not this
time, they say.

""Before this, 40 per cent of the Nishad community voted for the temple,"" said
Nagendra Nishad, a resident of Pipraich. ""But now the community has woken up
to their lies, there is no reservation, they have given us nothing.""

In addition, BSP voters turned out in force to convince the party supporters
to vote for the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP, and that made a dent in the BJP's vote
bank.

""Forget old animosities, now it's about

_bua-bhatija_

,"" said Shiv Shankar Ram, a supporter of the BSP who lives in Gorakhpur Rural,
an assembly segment where the SP took a lead of 16,281 votes over the BJP.
""Behenji's instructions came in the newspapers, on television that we should
vote for the SP, so all BSP supporters voted for the SP.""

Even in Gorakhpur City assembly segment, the BJP's bastion, the party's margin
fell from 81,812 to 24,577, which BJP workers blame on poor voter turnout.

__ Comments

Fascinatingly, the dip in total votes polled in Gorakhpur Urban, 42,472 votes,
corresponds almost exactly to the 43,579 fewer votes the BJP got in 2018 in
comparison to 2014. Meanwhile, the collective support for the opposition
alliance rose by over 13,000 votes. Clearly, BJP voters chose not to vote this
time.

""We don't consider this a loss because voter turnout was low,"" explained Ajay
Agarwal, a local BJP worker. ""We weren't prepared for the SP-BSP's sudden
alliance but it isn't that all the Dalit votes went to them.""

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What was the thesildar doing? How did he allow sale of agri land for non-agri purposes? All states have a base price for land deals depending on area, why was that not enforced in 2013 when Modi wasn't around? 

AFAIK, the Government acts like a muscled bodyguard-cum-*dalal* of bijinessmen when it comes to 'acquiring' land from farmers. In fact, one of the criticisms of Narendra's Land Grab Bill was, it should make provisions to make fatcats deal directly with farmers, so that the latter are spared the ignominy of having to countenance armed and bureaucratic machinery, and run from pillar to post for getting paid for their land. Traders want more 'eej of doing bijines' - they hate having to deal with government, why shouldn't farmers be granted the same?!

&gt; Kailas Shevale of Kali Aai Mukti Sangram said, “Firestone Diamonds had bought the 250-acre parcel of land from around 100 farmers at a paltry price of Rs 15,000 to Rs 25, 000 per acre to set up a solar power plant between 2010 and 2012. **At the time of acquiring the plots, the farmers were assured that one member of each family will be given a job. Currently, a 2.5 MW plant is operational at the site, but none of the farmers’ families was given a job.**”

&gt; Firestone Diamonds had planned to commission a 25-MW plant at the stie. Shevale also alleged that **some of the farmers were not even paid the entire compensation amount.**

&gt; “As Modi has fled the country and the **25-MW plant is unlikely to happen**, the farmers should be given back their land and should be allowed to till it,” Shevale said.


Do you still think the farmers are morally wrong in protesting?

Consider this, about land acquisition for SEZs:

&gt; The state government has decided to return fertile land that had been notified for a special economic zone (SEZ) by Bharat Forge, close on the heels of Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s remark that land acquisition must be done in a manner that does not cause loss of large tracts of productive agricultural land. She has also called for a humane approach while acquiring land.

&gt; “The decision to return 583 hectares of horticulture land notified for the Bharat Forge SEZ in Khed-Shirur near Pune has been taken,” a revenue department official told HT, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Farmers in six villages — Pur, Warude, Gasasi, Retwadi, Pabal and Chondharwadi — will benefit.”

&gt; Pune district collector Chandrakant Dalvi confirmed the administration had recommended fertile land be excluded from the Bharat Forge project.

&gt; Cancelled Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Maharashtra will have to return the Revenue department land they have acquired, but they can keep the land bought from farmers, officials said.

&gt; According to an official from Industries Department, more than 24,000 hectares were acquired for SEZs by industrial houses in the state.


.


&gt; Land measuring 24,784 hectares, both public and private, was bought for the SEZs by various industrial houses in the state. These lands are still in their custody, though the licenses of 70 SEZs were either cancelled or their promoters quit the scheme, after a change in policy by the central government, he said.

&gt; In the remaining 69 SEZs, the businesses have not yet been set up on the land acquired, the official said.



&gt; Apurva Chandra, Principal Secretary (Industries), said, ""If the land has been acquired from farmers, it will remain with the entrepreneur for whom the SEZ was approved. If the land is acquired from the Revenue department, the state will take it back in case the SEZ is cancelled.""

&gt; Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse admitted that most of the industrial houses have not returned huge tracts of land to the original owners or the government.

.

&gt; A rule framed by the Revenue Department states that the land acquired by industrialists from farmers should be returned to them in case they fail to start their ventures on it within 10 years.

&gt; The state has given sops like exemption from paying stamp duty and local body taxes for setting up SEZs.

Source: [Cancelled SEZs in Maharashtra will have to return government land](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/cancelled-sezs-in-maharashtra-will-have-to-return-government-land/articleshow/49883480.cms)

&gt; The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the central and six state governments on a PIL seeking return of unutilised land of farmers that were acquired for SEZs and a CBI probe into the alleged diversion of loans raised by the SEZ developers.

&gt; The bench of Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice L Nageswara Rao issued notice as they were told that 80 percent of the land that was acquired for developing SEZs remained unutilised but loans raised against them by their developers were diverted for their other businesses.

.

&gt; Senior counsel Colin Gonsalves appearing for the petitioner farmers cited the CAG report which said that ""we noted a trend wherein developers approached the government for allotment/purchase of area of land in the name of SEZ. However, only a fraction of land so acquired was notified for SEZs and later de-notification was also resorted to within a few years to benefit from price appreciation in terms of area of land"".

&gt; He also noted that the CAG report said that out of 39,245 hectares notified in the six states (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha), 5402.22 hectares (14 percent) of land was de-notified and diverted for commercial purposes in several cases.

&gt; ""Many tracts of these lands were acquired invoking the 'public purpose clause' thus land acquired was not serving the objectives of SEZ Act,"" Gonsalves said referring to the CAG report.

&gt; Besides seeking the return of farmers land and the Central Bureau of Probe into its mis-utilisation, the petitioner has sought declaration that the action of the state government in acquiring lands in the names of SEZ was ""unconstitutional being violative of Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution for causing joblessness to the farmers and agricultural labour"".

.

&gt; The PIL urged the court to direct the conduct of comprehensive social impact study on farmers whose lands were acquired and they rendered jobless.

&gt; It has also sought direction to the Centre to initiate criminal and civil action against the SEZ developers for not discharging their obligation under the contract and thereby causing unemployment, wastage of natural resources, causing loss to food security and other consequences.

**Relish idea of Modi vs Rest in 2019: Amit Shah** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

BJP

chief

Amit Shah

has welcomed the prospect of a “Modi vs the Rest” battle in 2019 while daring
the opposition to put its

proposed no-confidence motion to test +

, asserting that it will be easily defeated by a 300-plus majority commanded
by the

NDA

in the Lok Sabha.

“Why is the no-confidence being moved so late...We are ready to face the
motion. There should be a debate as per norms in the House.

Congress

and other parties know of their imminent defeat and that is why they are not
allowing the House to function,” he said.

About the opposition’s bid to forge a non-BJP alliance in the aftermath of its

success in the recent bypolls +

, the BJP chief said, “There was a time when it used to be Indira Gandhi vs
the Rest and now the scenario has changed as its Modi vs the Rest.”

He said BJP is in office in 67% of India’s geographical area.

Referring to notices for no-confidence motions submitted by YSR Congress and

Telugu Desam Party

(TDP) over their unmet demand for

special status for Andhra Pradesh +

, which the Centre has said is constitutionally impermissible, the BJP
president said it is ironic that while the House is not allowed to function, a
no-trust motion is being moved.

He said the alliance talk among the opposition parties shows BJP’s influence
under Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

. “They (Congress) talk over dinner but we believe in direct interaction with
people,” he said.

“It is for people to decide whether they reiterate confidence in the most
successful PM of the country or vote for an orange-like alliance,” Shah said,
arguing that NDA has grown exponentially under Modi and the best example is
BJP’s success in the north-eastern states.

Shah said even Congress leader

Mallikarjun Kharge

acknowledged the strength of BJP as he cited the party’s booth management at
the AICC plenary on Saturday. “But Congress is dreaming and we want them to
continue to do so. Let the polls come, BJP will win with more seats than
2014,” he said.

Shah said the opposition allegations of arrogance are unfounded as the party
believes in hard work and grows brick by brick. “BJP has never split but there
are Congress parties from A to Z as its leaders float a new party after a
defeat,” he added.

I agree, the buyers will have excellent strategies to get the land from them, legally, but its the duty of those farmers to not fall for their impressive tactics. The farmers would've seen short term capital coming in, and boom, emotional split second greed/desire takes over, and before you know it, you are off that land.

Because even we know that one day BJP/Modi will fall to anti-incumbency and we will be in power again. People can mock Shahzada as much they want, but the prince is destined to be the King one day.

If the opposition hasn’t learnt anything out of BJP’s election playbook, they deserve to lose not once but always till the day they evolve to fight in the new fighting arena. The rules of the game are changed, parties need to be aggressive in their strategy, they need heavy PR, they need to develop a reliable ground-level cadre, they need youths devoted to them ideologically.

Otherwise, opposition will win only when the BJP’s penchant for win is lost, when Amit Shah stops managing elections at booth level, and Modiji stops giving pompous speeches and misusing CBI, and when BJP’s cadre at the ground loses their ideological support of BJP’s covert and overt mission.

&gt; The party which is hellbent on screwing private schools through RTE legislation ...

It reflects badly on the school that they cannot educate everyone without discriminating among the students. If a student fails it is as much a failure of the institution as it is of the student and his parents. Blaming RTE for the failure of the institution is plain ridiculous and reeks of a class / caste mentality.

&gt; India can train a lot of doctors but those doctors will not get jobs 

Rahul Gandhi explained this a bit in his speech. AI isn't going to completely replace doctors in the near future but only assist them.

BJP has historically allowed for private players in higher education. 

RTE exempts minority institutions. Its like a christian and a hindu start a school. Hindu school has to playground, student teacher ratio, has to hire teachers as per government rules, modify building as per code etc and also give 25% reservation. For the 25% reservation, the school can't conduct a test or interview - everything will be decided by government. And government compensation is lower than actual costs incurred and government doesn't pay for 5-6 years. After all this, the hindu will have a higher cost of running the school and worse results as compared to the christian school next door and ultimately will shut down.

**Congress plenary live: RBI should meet Tirupati's hundi collectors. They count money faster, says Chidambaram** 

 ______ 
After Sonia Gandhi and

Rahul Gandhi

's scathing attack against Narendra Modi-led NDA government yesterday,

Congress

today continued its aggressive stance in its three-day plenary session in
Delhi.

On the second day of the session, senior Congress leaders

Manmohan Singh

, P

Chidambaram

,

Anand

Sharma came down heavily on the Modi government on issues ranging from foreign
policy to the state of the economy. The session, which is a first since
Gandhi’s elevation to the presidential post, is called ‘Change is now’ and is
aimed at projecting young faces of the party at the forefront.

The party's 84th plenary also authorsied party President Rahul Gandhi to
constitute the Congress Working Committee.

**_Here are all the updates from the Congress Plenary:   
_** **P Chidambaram:  
**  

* We will come back with allies and friends in 2019 and take this country forward. 

* 

Demonetisation

was a big lie... They said they would put an end to black money, to
corruption. Every rally of PM has been financed by nothing but black money

* Modi government inherited a strong economy. The task of development has to be continued by future generations. However, today, the Indian economy is decoupled from the world economy which is growing. 

* Only yesterday Krugman said no country in the world has increased its 

GDP

in 10 years except India. Whatever NDA may say, the record speaks for itself

* When world growth was picking up, Indian economy decoupled from that trend. 

* The current phase of economic growth started in 1990s when Rajiv Gandhi sowed seeds of liberalisation. This gained momentum under Dr Manmohan Singh. Whatever the BJP, the NDA may say, records speak for themselves. 

* It's the biggest achievement of Dr Manmohan Singh that 14 crore people were lifted out of poverty. I charge BJP government they have pushed people into poverty. Demonetisation pushed people into poverty. Hundreds of people died waiting in queues to withdraw their own money from the banks. A flawed GST pushed people into poverty. 

* The number of people below poverty line has increased in absolute numbers over the last four years. 

* On Demonetisation: RBI is still counting and won't tell us how much money has come back.I would like to tell the RBI officials — why don't you go to Hundi collectors in Tirupati? They count money faster than you. 

* Some thought that I wouldn't stand here to speak to you and present the economic resolution. I draw my courage and strength from each of you. If there is steel in me it has been instilled in me by 45 years of association with Congress party. 

**Manmohan Singh:**

* Modi government has mismanaged J&amp;amp;K dispute like never before. The atmosphere in the state is deteriorating every day. It's obvious from the fact that our borders are insecure, be it cross border-terror or internal. 

* When Modi ji was campaigning he made lots of tall promises. Those promises have not been fulfilled. He said we will provide 2 crore jobs, we have not seen even 2 lakh jobs. 

* Modi government made tall promises that farmers' income will be doubled in 6 years; it is just a jumla-type statement unlikely to be achieved. For that to achieve, a growth rate of 12% per year is necessary which is unthinkable in the current scenario. BJP-led govt messed up Indian economy. 

* India stands at the crossroads. We have opportunities, but we also have challenges. Congress party will provide a new pathway to chalk out the future of our country. 

* The defense expenditure of our country is no more than 1.6% of our GDP. This is far too inadequate to meet the challenges of our security apparatus and our needs 

* Congress party made India what it is today. It led the freedom struggle and guided India towards development after Independence. Today, we face similar challenges of carrying forward development and social justice. UPA govt could achieve a lot because of Sonia Gandhi's guidance 

**Anand Sharma: **

* Modi govt has disrupted India's foreign policy. In the last four years they have made this a divisive policy. They have pursued this in a cavalier, non-serious manner. 

* PM is carried away by his own propaganda. Today it is a matter of concern that we have mismanaged our relations with major capitals of the world, with major strategic partners and our immediate neighborhood. 

Earlier, the party also adopted a resolution against government's foreign
policy. Congress attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for pursuing a
""personalised foreign policy"", saying it was ""confused and bereft of focus and
direction"".

Moving the resolution on foreign policy, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma
said the Prime Minister was known for his ""propaganda"" and condemned his
actions of showing disrespect to the party's predecessors saying: ""It is not
an insult to the Congress party or its leaders, but an insult to the nation.""

The resolution said: ""Foreign policy has always been marked with continuity
with the backing of a strong national consensus. Unfortunately, the BJP
government has disrupted it, and its ill-advised actions have unravelled the
national consensus.

""The discarding of India's historic role in the Non-Aligned Movement, and the
continuous dismissal of our past accomplishments in foreign policy, led to the
piquant situation of foreign leaders hailing Nehru's contributions at the
Indo-African Forum Summit and the 50th Anniversary of the Bandung Conference,""
the resolution said.

**Congress Pitches ""Rich Tax"" On Top 1% To Help The Poor, Targets Centre** 

 ______ 
Key leaders of the grand old party Congress attended the plenary session on
Saturday.

**New Delhi: **

The Congress on Saturday said it would impose a five per cent cess on the
income of the top one per cent richest Indians when it comes to power.

The resolution on ""Agriculture, Employment and Poverty Alleviation"", adopted
at the party's 84th plenary in Delhi, also said that the party shall create a
National Poverty Alleviation Fund while this 5 per cent cess would ""be used
directly to give education scholarships to the children from Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, and other BPL families"".

The Congress also noted that the rising levels of income inequality is a
direct result of the ""anti-poor policies"" of the Narendra Modi government.

""The BJP had promised 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', but has acted contrary to
their slogan. The wealth of the richest one percent has gone up by 73 per cent
while the wealth of the bottom half of the population has grown by just 1 per
cent during the BJP regime,"" it added.

The party said Aadhaar would be used to improve targeting the eligible
beneficiaries under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and other
welfare schemes.

Attacking BJP's ""flawed and deliberate"" anti-farmer policies, it said: ""The
farmers today face mounting indebtedness, non-remunerative prices for their
crops, increasing cost of production and declining agricultural credit,
forcing many farmers to commit suicide.""

""The anti-farmer mindset of the BJP stands exposed as agricultural growth
under the NDA II (2014-18) as well as during NDA I (1998-2004), has fallen to
half of growth levels achieved during the UPA government headed by former
Prime Minister Monmohan Singh,"" said the resolution.

The party said BJP government is duping the farmers by making empty noises of
doubling farm incomes by 2022.

Congress also resolved to bring in a farmer-centric paradigm shift in the
Indian agriculture and restore profitability, taking a humanitarian and
compassionate approach to enhance farmers' incomes, ensuring them dignity, a
good education to their children, healthcare to their families and financial
and social security through pensions to farmers and farm workers.

""We would bring a loan waiver scheme for all small and marginal farmers in the
country on the pattern of the farm loan waiver program of the UPA govt in 2009
benefitting 3.2 crore farmers.""

The party also resolved to review the methodology used by the Commission for
Agricultural Costs and Prices to determine the MSP to guarantee remunerative
income to the farmers, factoring all relevant input costs including
warehousing and transportation.

It said that it would review The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna and will
draft a new insurance scheme which is beneficial to farmers rather than
private insurance companies.

""Congress plans to have a network of food-parks/ special agricultural zones.
The issue of GST on agricultural equipment and other inputs would be re-
examined to lower input costs for the farmer,"" it added.

__ Comments

It also said the party would renew its focus on manpower intensive
manufacturing for domestic and export sectors, making India the destination of
choice for international manufacturing.

The resolution also said the party would facilitate the setting up of IT Skill
Upgradation Fund.

409,"Reputation (esp for research) in educational institutes is build on work done for decades. It is ridiculously disingenuous to say private institutes are not doing as well as government institutes when private institutes have freedom to operate for a much shorter period. There is also an exemption in higher education as well - ISB is generally considered as good as or better than IIMs which were established almost 4-6 decades ago. No one compares the new IIMs with ISB. Then there is a DAIICT is also doing well.

Further, private schools beat government schools by a wide margin. For almost all entrance tests, private institutions are preferred for preparation.

Also, no one is asking for complete privatization of education. What I am asking is will private institutions be allowed to function with freedom and autonomy?

&gt;&gt;The party which is hellbent on screwing private schools through RTE legislation ...

&gt; It reflects badly on the school that they cannot educate everyone without discriminating among the students. If a student fails it is as much a failure of the institution as it is of the student and his parents. Blaming RTE for the failure of the institution is plain ridiculous and reeks of a class / caste mentality.

Did you even read the RTE act? Or its impact? How many thousands of schools were closed because of it? A law is much more than slogans. Bloody everywhere the standards of schooling are falling because of RTE act (no detention policy meant every kid gets promoted irrespective of meeting learning level). **I would imagine that if you want to educate more children, you will want to open more schools, not close the existing ones.** But over intellectual class only claims victimization of class/caste mentality, never how policy effects players.

&gt; Rahul Gandhi explained this a bit in his speech. AI isn't going to completely replace doctors in the near future but only assist them. He gave the example of pilot - todays huge jet literally fly themselves and pilots act more like ""system integrators"" rather than actually fly the plane. He believes that doctors and AI in healthcare will be similar.

If this prediction is the basis of government policy, it has a very high probability for failure. If 1 college were to do this, it might succeed. A government policy should enable workforce for a multitude of options in future (some prepare for more AI, some prepare for less AI), not something that RG or MMS or Modi believes will happen in technology.

411,"Modi pursuing personalised foreign policy bereft of direction: Congress

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-pursuing-personalised-foreign-policy-bereft-of-direction-congress/story-PUBD0d7BxxTqMCYczMZFfJ.html

&gt;&gt;The Congress on Sunday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for pursuing a “personalised foreign policy”, saying it was “confused and bereft of focus and direction”.

In its 84th Plenary session, the party noted that the Modi’s tendency to disparage his predecessors and diminish India’s achievements since Independence has undercut the country’s credibility abroad.

Moving the resolution on foreign policy, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said the Prime Minister was known for his “propaganda” and condemned his actions of showing disrespect to the party’s predecessors saying: “It is not an insult to the Congress party or its leaders, but an insult to the nation.”

The resolution said: “Foreign policy has always been marked with continuity with the backing of a strong national consensus. Unfortunately, the BJP government has disrupted it, and its ill-advised actions have unravelled the national consensus.

“The government is carried away by its own propaganda, and has mismanaged India’s relations with major partner countries. Its foreign policy is confused and bereft of focus and direction.

“The Prime Minister has pursued a personalised foreign policy. The foreign policy engagements and (Modi’s) visits abroad, have been reduced to being purely transactional.

“The discarding of India’s historic role in the Non-Aligned Movement, and the continuous dismissal of our past accomplishments in foreign policy, led to the piquant situation of foreign leaders hailing Nehru’s contributions at the Indo-African Forum Summit and the 50th Anniversary of the Bandung Conference.

“Regrettably, the official Indian speeches omitted all mention of his (Nehru’s), and India’s, major contributions.”

The resolution added: “The world today, is going through a comprehensive transformation in international relations.

“This is a period of unusual uncertainty and unexpected changes. This poses complex challenges for our foreign policy. A rapidly transforming and uncertain global landscape, demands a carefully crafted national security strategy.”

**Maharashtra farmers ‘reclaim’ land acquired by Nirav Modi’s firm** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| Mumbai |

Published: March 17, 2018 7:23 pm

Farmers in Ahmednagar’s Khandala Village staged a protest ‘as a symbol to show
their ownership’ of the land which they say was acquired from them by
NiravModi at less than normal rates. (ANI Twitter)

Farmers in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra on Saturday claimed that
fugitive jeweller Nirav Modi, prime accused in the alleged Rs 11,400 crore
Punjab National Bank fraud, had acquired their lands at less than prevailing
rates.

A group of over 200 farmers, who arrived in bullock carts at the tract of land
at Khandala in Karjat tehsil, ploughed a part of it using a tractor as a
symbolic reclaiming of possession. They will start cultivation on the full 125
acres of the acquired land soon, farmers said. Today’s protest was meant to
show that farmers have reclaimed their land, which was acquired on behalf of
Nirav Modi’s Firestar company some years ago, they said.

The land is among the properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate as a
part of its probe against Modi who has fled the country, said a farmer
activist. Protesting farmers also carried the tricolour and portraits of King
Shivaji and Dr B R Ambedkar.

They carried the banner of ‘Kaali Aai Mukti Sangram’, a local farmers’
organisation. “The land was acquired from farmers at around Rs 15,000 per
acre, whereas the government rate for land compensation in the area is around
Rs 20 lakh per acre now,” lawyer and activist Karbhari Gawli, who was part of
today’s protest, told PTI over phone from Ahmednagar. A police official from
the Karjat police station said no “untoward incident” was reported from
Khandala village today.

431,"&gt; Did you even read the RTE act? Or its impact? How many thousands of schools were closed because of it?

My family does run a school in my village / town (recently became a high school 3 years back). The RTE acts didn't bother us because:

- We run it as a non-profitable institute as schools are meant to be.
- We already gave preference to local students.
- We already ensured that a percentage of students were from EBC.
- We strictly comply with all government regulations / specifications.

On the other hand, my friend runs a very profitable kindergarten in Bangalore. And wants to expand and start a primary school. She says that she has recently started asking for ""donations"" for admission to raise the fund. I get that it is many times more expensive to run a school in a highly urbanised city, especially a metro. 

My point is that a for-profit mentality is behind the backlash against RTE.

&gt; A government policy should enable workforce for a multitude of options in future (some prepare for more AI, some prepare for less AI), not something that RG or MMS or Modi believes will happen in technology.

I'll take RG's or MMS's understanding of these subjects any day over anyone here because they actually interacted with the experts on this field (by the way, Mr. Krugman too has met both). And luckily, in the Congress, they allow a team of experts to frame policies. Not believe that they themselves are experts, like Modi.

&gt; Historically, the kind of predictions that RG is doing have a high likelihood of not being realized.

- Modi government made tall promises that farmers' income will be doubled in 6 years; it is just a jumla-type statement unlikely to be achieved. For that to achieve, a growth rate of 12% per year is necessary which is unthinkable in the current scenario. BJP-led govt messed up Indian economy.

- India stands at the crossroads. We have opportunities, but we also have challenges. Congress party will provide a new pathway to chalk out the future of our country. 

- The defense expenditure of our country is no more than 1.6% of our GDP. This is far too inadequate to meet the challenges of our security apparatus and our needs.

- Congress party made India what it is today. It led the freedom struggle and guided India towards development after Independence. Today, we face similar challenges of carrying forward development and social justice. UPA govt could achieve a lot because of Sonia Gandhi's guidance

**Raj Thackeray lashes out at Modi, CM in Mumbai, warns of plan to stir communal riots before polls** 

 ______ 
Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday claimed that in the
coming months, communal riots will be engineered in the country around the
issue of Ram Temple.

While addressing a rally at Shivaji Park, Thackeray alleged that some people
are hatching a conspiracy to stir communal riots in India to win the next
elections. “In the next few months, there will be Hindu-Muslim riots. The main
cause will be the Ram Temple. The case before the Supreme Court is being fast
tracked to win the election. According to my information, some people are
holding talks with Muslim bodies on rioting immediately after the Ram temple
issue is resolved,” he said. He slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and
said if the temple is going to be an election issue, then let it be built a
year later.

Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Thackeray said the government is
not acting in the interest of the nation. In his speech that lasted over an
hour, Thackeray equated the central government with Hitler’s. According to
him, despite Modi’s foreign visits, he failed to get investment for the
country. “Some time ago (Amit) Shah said that selling pakodas (fritters) is
also a profession. Then did Modi visit all these countries to get flour for
these pakodas? He has not managed to even one rupee of investment,” Thackeray
said.

Questioning the need for the bullet train project that will cost the exchequer
Rs1.10lakh crore, he said, “Like Maharashtra, the people of Gujarat also do
not want a bullet train. Maharashtra, which has a debt of over Rs4lakh crore
will borrow just because of the PM’s stubbornness.” He also targeted Modi for
disallowing the proposed international financial services centre in Mumbai.
“It would have generated 70,000 to 80,000 jobs for people in the state. But he
promoted the one in Gujarat,” he said. Thackeray said people of the state are
stuck with caste politics which is not healthy. To woo the Marathi voters, he
said it is time for them to realise that a conspiracy is being hatched to grab
land from original land owners and hand it over to outsiders in the name of
infrastructure projects. He also appealed to Konkan farmers to not spare the
land for the proposed Ratnagiri refinery project.

Thackeray said the coverage on actress Sridevi’s death was an attempt to
divert the attention from the Nirav Modi scandal. “Why wasn’t Judge Loya’s
death discussed in the media at a similar length even though it too was
suspicious?” he said.

Thackeray also alleged that the government of India is making “adjustmemts”
with the country’s most wanted man Dawood Ibrahim. “According to my
information, Dawood wants to come to India and spend his last days in the
country. The government is making adjustments with him. Is this how a
government is run?” he said.

452,"&gt; Does it not frighten you that media is too scared to even fucking mention Loya case? 

Yes it does but that's what this is about. It's not just his Loya comments that aren't being shown, no comment from that speech that would paint him in an even halfway legitimate light is being shown. It's just Sridevi and Modi-mukt Bharat stuff, former used has a proof of his heartlessness the latter of his hypocrisy. 

I'm only talking about Delhi and English media btw, Marathi media is for the most part is giving him fair coverage. 

&gt;yes, be in denial

I like how this subreddit has flipped over the last few months. Earlier even if you would disagree even a little bit with a pro BJP comment, you'd get jumped on, be made into a strawman and rained with downvotes. Now it's the exact opposite.

**No-confidence motion live: Lok Sabha adjourned till 12 PM after ruckus** 

 ______ 
The Telugu Desam Party (

TDP

) and Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSR Congress) moved no-
confidence motions against the Narendra Modi government in the

Lok Sabha

today.

However, the Speaker may not take up the matter if the opposition protests
continue in the House. With the no-confidence motion set to fail and posing no
danger to the government, the whole exercise is likely to become a slanging
match between NDA and Opposition.

_Here are all the updates from no-confidence motion:  
_

* YSR Congress and TDP move no-confidence motion, Speaker adjourns Lok Sabha till noon after uproar. 

* 

AIADMK

, Shiv Sena say no decision yet on support to no-trust motion

* We are ready to face no-confidence motion as we are confident as we have support in the House: Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar 

* YSCRP, TDP members protest in Parliament over special status to 

Andhra Pradesh

* Parliament secretariat received three notices on no-confidence motion -- 2 from TDP and 1 from 

YSRCP

. If House in order and quorum established, LS Speaker may take up no-
confidence motion after Question Hour.

* TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu holds conference meeting with MPs ahead of no-confidence motion. 

* Both the government and Opposition have braced themselves for handling the no-confidence motion if the matter is taken up in Lok Sabha. Trinamool, AIMIM, 

RJD

and SP have announced support to the motion. Congress is also likely to
support.

* The Speaker didn't take notices last week, as she said the House was not in order. 

* The government needs support of 272 members to stay in power and faces no threat as it has support of more than 300 members, including NDA partners like SAD, LJP, RLSP, NCP and JDU in Lok Sabha. BJP alone has 274 MPs. 

* The saffron party is also preparing the ground for taking this fight to the people of Andhra Pradesh. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav was appointed as AP in-charge on Sunday.

**Sorry RBI governor Urjit Patel, but the buck stops with you** 

 ______ 
Urjit Patel put the onus of the oversight failure in PNB fraud on the
overzealous ministry of finance which he claimed had dual regulation rights.
Photo: Reuters

Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel formally
joined the blame game that erupted after the uncovering of the Rs12,636 crore
scam on 14 February allegedly engineered by jeweller Nirav Modi in the Punjab
National Bank (PNB).

In a blistering response to critics—including comments emerging sotto voce
from within the Union government—he claimed that the RBI was being unfairly
targeted as it was not, either through errors of omission or commission,
equipped with the requisite fire power to deal with such errant public sector
banks. According to Patel, the Banking Regulation Act in its existing form had
led to “emaciation” of RBI’s powers with respect to corporate governance
issues, one of the factors contributing to financial frauds at public sector
banks.

In short, he put the onus of the oversight failure—this scam went undetected
for nearly eight years in a branch of PNB located just a stone’s throw from
RBI—on the overzealous ministry of finance which he claimed had dual
regulation rights (a euphemism for backseat driving).

The fact that Patel delivered the missive at the Gujarat National Law
University (GNLU) in Gandhinagar (the former base of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi) only underlined the tone of defiance so visible throughout the lecture.

There are several observations that stem from Patel’s outburst which may be
worth noting.

For one, it is a clear signal that communication between RBI and North Block
has all but broken down; this doesn’t augur well for macroeconomic management
as the fiscal policy (defined by finance ministry) and monetary policy
(purview of RBI) need to be coordinated, for which you need undisturbed
dialogue. The angry outpouring though is not unique to Patel’s tenure, his
predecessors have had equally ugly run-ins with the leadership in the finance
ministry (but have preferred to articulate it after concluding their tenure in
tell-all memoirs).

The response from North Block did not take long in coming. News reports
published the day after cited unnamed officials from finance ministry citing
the rule book to argue that Patel was wrong in his claims. Guess, unless one
side blinks, this conversation has only one way to go: downhill.

Second, Patel’s argument comes across as an afterthought and defensive
especially as it comes from a regulator. While he may be right in pointing out
there is a mismatch in oversight rights between public sector banks and
private banks with the latter more under control of RBI, the timing of his
argument is highly suspect.

If indeed it was such a cause for concern it would have made sense going
public on this any time in the nearly two years of his tenure at the helm.
Especially since it is a structural flaw and if unresolved would have sooner
if not later led to the fiscal fatality of the kind that happened at the PNB.

Thirdly, the RBI governor’s claim that as a regulator RBI can’t be omnipresent
is baffling to say the least: “It is simply infeasible for a banking regulator
to be in very nook and corner of banking activity to rule out frauds by ‘being
there’.” Imagine if we extended this argument to all regulators or watchdogs
(like the police). Then why even bother to regulate. It is one thing to say
that despite the best safeguards, some criminals will get the better of the
system, but an entirely another thing to argue very smugly about inevitability
and claim that there is only so much RBI can do.

Sorry governor (I’m aware neither the regulator nor the groupies likely to
make RBI’s case will agree) but the buck stops with you!

Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has had a busy fortnight during which the party lost its eastern bastion of Tripura, and organised a successful farmer’s march in Mumbai. It is in the middle of a raging debate on what approach to adopt on alliances ahead of a key party congress. Yechury spoke to Saubhadra Chatterji and Prashant Jha on a range of political issues. Excerpts:

The farmer front of the CPI(M) last week had this massive rally in an unlikely city, Mumbai. How did you pull it off?

Yes, it was a historic moment. But preparations for that movement actually started three years ago at a meeting between the CPI(M) and the All India Kisan Sabha (the party’s farmer front). Agitations were held in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and in 2016; there was a massive gathering in Nasik when farmers blockaded the city. This time, the farmers marched to Mumbai as the state government did not keep its promise on loan waiver. It evoked unprecedented public empathy. People set up camps to serve food and water to farmers. The elites of Mumbai offered footwear and medical treatment. Farmers were also remarkably disciplined. When it turned out that they may enter the city on a day of examinations, they decided to march trough the night instead of disrupting everyday life. The farmer’s demands turned into a people’s issue.

‘The Left and elections’

While your farmer’s front could gain such public support, why is it that the CPI(M) is fast losing electoral support?

That is the key issue we have repeatedly discussed in the party. On the issue of economic exploitation, the red flag instills confidence but when it comes to social oppression, we are still not able to do so. In elections, caste-based issues are important and voting is based on social groupings. That is why we decided in the last party congress that we would take up, strongly, both the issues of economic exploitation and social oppression. We concluded that our support base, our capacity had declined and we have to not only regain it but expand.

You lost West Bengal after the Singur and Nandigram episode. In Tripura there was no such upheaval. Still, you lost Tripura to the BJP.

Yes, there was no such incident and that’s why the result was unexpected. During the last two years or so, the BJP has emerged as the anti-Left pole. It swallowed other forces like the Congress and the Trinamool Congress in Tripura. It also did a bit of social engineering by forming a coalition with extremist tribal parties. There has also been a great social change in Tripura in the last 25 years. There is peace, the healthcare system has improved, the literacy rate is better than Kerala. So, you have a large section of the population which is healthy and educated but without jobs. Job creation is a tougher challenge in Tripura. It is landlocked with limited connectivity. So, meeting the growing aspirations of the young generation of Tripura also became a big challenge.

The CPI(M) could not regain Bengal and lost Tripura when you are the general secretary of the party. Do you hold yourself responsible to certain extent?

There is certainly a degree of personal responsibility and sadness even as in our party we believe in collective leadership. But please remember that we regained Kerala in this period. We are maintaining status quo! But of course, I want to see our situation improve.

Are you ready for a second term as general secretary?

In our party, it’s not about one’s choice. It is the party that decides the responsibility of every leader.

‘Alliances’

You agree that Modi-led BJP is a formidable force and it has expanded like never before. On the other hand, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has called for a UPA-like coalition. Where does the CPI(M) stand in this possible opposition unity?

In 2004, the CPI(M), with 61 MPs, gave issue-based support to the UPA to keep the BJP out of power. But out of those 61 seats, remember we won 57 by defeating Congress candidate. Our entire focus is on alternative policies not on alternative leadership. Also, politics is not arithmetic. Here 2+2 can be 22 or even a big zero. What is required is a policy platform.

There is no doubt that the task is to remove the BJP from power. But there can’t be any pan-Indian, broad, pre-poll front against the BJP. I think, regionally, in different states, there would be different calculations to achieve this task. We will fight against the BJP in places where we are strong. But overall, our party will discuss in the upcoming Party Congress on appropriate electoral tactics to maximize votes for the anti-BJP forces.

It is an open secret that there is a debate in your party on the line to adopt on alliances. Can you shed light on it?

There is agreement in the party on the need to defeat this BJP-led government. There may be differences on how to get there but we are united.

Are you worried about the situation in West Bengal where the BJP is fast becoming the prime opponent to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress?

What is happening in Bengal is competitive communalism—and I am extremely worried about it. Banerjee’s politics is helping the BJP grow and both are feeding off each other. When the Left was in power in Bengal, this communal politics were never seen.

On Congress, Rahul Gandhi has taken charge as the Congress president. We know that you enjoy a great rapport with both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. How do you see Gandhi evolving as the Congress president?

He has just taken over and we want see him for some time before assessing his performance. But this generational change is inevitable. India is the youngest nation and so young leadership must come up.

There is a sense that Rahul may have a broad left-of-centre positioning. Would that help evolve common policies?

It is a little early. There is no doubt that within Congress, for long, there has been a left-of-centre line. Remember the right to employment, information, education, food was passed under them — but of course because of our pressure. At the same time, Congress also followed neo-liberal economic policies. During UPA, 49% of the country’s wealth belonged to 1% of Indian population. I told Dr Manmohan Singh — Sir you have created two India’s. Now of course the situation is worse. 73% of wealth is in the hands of that 1%.

Do you see Congress playing the role of the principal anchor or as a supplement in 2019?

Given the heterogeneity of Indian politics, it would be difficult to say now who will lead a non-BJP coalition if it comes to power. I believe 2019 election will be either the 2004—when regional parties supported the Congress—or the 1996 situation, when the Congress supported a united front government.",2018-03-19 20:10:15
