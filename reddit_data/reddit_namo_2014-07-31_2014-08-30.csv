0,"I think election was keeping Islamophobia in check. I use to be super active during election time because there were discussions which interested me and made me want to say something. Now whenever I come here all the Namo-Pappu-Kejriwal posts are replaced with Muslims so terrorist, Oh! That Hindu guy said something stupid wager wagerah. 

Namotard-aaptard posts without name calling are always fine in this sub because that affects us in our daily life too. However this religious thing is getting too much. I mean hating a politicians is okay because almost all of them are manipulating bastards but hating an entire community because some idiot something somewhere is a different ball game altogether.

I am NaMo supporter atleast for this election, I wanted AK to get some experience in Delhi, learn and increase their reach before they can become a national party but alas, they jumped the gone. Probably, wrong advisers (Yogendra Yadav, Bhusan) guided him to take a cue from Obama.

Having said that, I am pretty pissed off at the way things have turned out for AAP and only AAP has to be blamed for it. As it is so difficult to energize people and make them socially active in India, now we lost a golden opportunity.",2014-08-03 20:14:36
4,"well, india and china have so far chosen diff parts to develop, India on one hand is service orientaded and china is manufacturing, 

 china's population is going down, so they need to turn towards service sector which will sooner or later give them slow motion growth,

meanwhile india under Namo will go for manufacturing, this and coupled with FDI we will surpass gdp growth rate of China within 5 years, 

Now, if we are able to continue with namo or anyone who is going to release the stops then,

**we will surpass china with 2 extra gdp growth every year, in almost 20-30 years, depending on what kind of route we take.** ",2014-08-05 04:37:42
5,"Thats the namo army incident? Where one user orchestrated a honey pot to attract like minded users to make a separate subreddit dedicated to influence r/india?

I'm definitely not talking about machinations that many magnitude away from daily moderation. 

Removals of AAP posters started going up, sufficiently that we started getting flak from them too.

Just by sheer numbers, the majority will carry the day in the race to create more posts and comments, and hence get moderated more often.

If he wanted to make something out of 28 seats his party won he could have done it. If you were in Delhi you will know that Congress and BJP both parties is full of corrupt people. BJP has been in power in Delhi MC for a decade and Congress was also in power at state level, but AAP could still secure 28 seats. Even in LS election AAP candidates were 2nd to BJP candidates.

I am not sure what you mean here, but BJP has time and again said that homosexuality is immoral and what not. Rajnath Singh ne announce kiya hai ki BJP doesn't support unnatural homosexuality - 

&gt;The BJP had opposed any move to nullify Supreme Court's order re-criminalizing consensual sex among consenting adults, dealing a huge setback to any move to scrap or dilute Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Party chief Rajnath Singh went to the extent of saying, ""Gay sex is not natural and we cannot support something which is unnatural."" - **No to homosexuals, yes to their vote** - http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-no-to-homosexuals-yes-to-their-vote-1970889

20,"This is because for the first time we truly have an outsider, the quintessential Aam Admi who has actually lived in our India and seen it closely.

Look at all our PM's who have completed a term thus far.

* Nehru? Close to Aristocracy.

* Indira? Heir to the throne.

* Rajiv? By now we have gone into the dynasty

* PVN? The first thaw, we had a journeyman PM and the results showed. He was still tied up by the Family and was in a way beholden to Sonia (comes very strongly in his fictional bio) so wasn't an outsider.

* ABV? Second ""our own"" PM, but he could not rise above the parivar nor escape coalition dharma. Also a career politician and an insider to the hilt.

* MMS? Sonia was PM so not even going there.

In NAMO we have an outsider PM from the humblest of roots and one who is clearly very patriotic.

Considering PVN and ABV have been our best PM's so far, odds are that NaMo will also deliver the goods.

26,"Exactly! While I don't want to read a ""right wing history of India"" (whatever that means) I am sick of reading this washed up history which tells us that the Muslim period was the only benign period in our history, while preceding that it was all warring lords, and after that was starvation and misery. I don't even know how the fuck it came on the agenda.

Thus far I have found Aurangzeb's chapters to be utterly and completely white washed, while here we see the white washing of Nalanda Destruction, and separately one of the things Shourie takes up is the white washing of the temple complex demolition that led to Qutub Minar construction.

Just to be clear, we don't want a new, 180-degree bend on the current biases: I merely want to read history for what it was.
