---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Leveling a direct and personal allegation that all but ends any prospect of a resolution of the standoff in Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday asked external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to reveal the amount of money her family received from controversial ex-IPL chief Lalit Modi.While Congress president Sonia Gandhi dismissed Swaraj's emotional defence of her role in Lalitgate as intended to help Modi's ailing wife as ""theatrics"", Rahul launched a no-holds-barred attack.

&gt;* ""Sushma should tell the country how much money her family, her daughter and husband got from Modi to keep him out of jail,"" he said.Rahul's reference to Swaraj's alleged links with Modi and the suggestion that money played a role in the former cricket czar being issued travel documents in UK takes Congress-BJP hostilities to a new pitch, virtually ruling out the possibility of Parliament functioning next week and passing any significant legislation like the land or GST bills.The Congress vice president slammed Swaraj's speech in Lok Sabha on Thursday as ""eloquent but hollow.""

&gt;* ""Responding to Swaraj's rhetorical poser over whether the Congress chief would have left Modi's cancer-stricken wife to die by denying her husband travel papers, Sonia said, ""Sushma is indulging in drama, she is adept at theatrics ...

&gt;* ""In a sarcastic tone, Rahul said as her son, he could tell that Sonia ""would not have done the same thing"".Justifying having told the UK authorities that issuing travel papers to Modi will not affect bilateral ties, Swaraj had said she only responded to the former IPL boss's plea on the grounds that his wife's surgery was potentially life threatening.

&gt;* With Congress set to re-enter Lok Sabha on Monday, the script is likely to repeat itself.As Congress protested for the fourth day in the Parliament complex with the party brass holding centrestage with loud slogans and clenched fists, Rahul has clearly upped the ante by taking the fight deeper into saffron territory.The strong words came in the wake of BJP's threat that Rahul would have to face defamation case if he does not apologise and take back his words against Sushma.

&gt; * CHENNAI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa over lunch at her residence here on Friday, in a significant amid his government's big push to get key bills passed in Parliament.

&gt; * Sources said during the 30-minute lunch meeting, when only two of them were present, the Prime Minister asked AIADMK chief for her party's support to the GST Bill, though a memorandum presented by her later expressed her opposition to the legislation that is part of the Modi government's proposed financial reforms.Predictably, Modi's lunch meeting with Jayalalithaa at her Poes Garden residence grabbed more attention than the National Handloom Day function at the centenary hall of the University of Madras which the Prime Minister had come to address.

&gt; * ""The chief minister presented a memorandum containing issues relating to Tamil Nadu that are pending with the Government of India,"" it said.The first move to seek AIADMK's support for the GST Bill was made by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley when he called on Jayalalithaa at her residence on January 18 this year, about one month after he had introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha.

&gt; * AIADMK had submitted a dissent note to the parliamentary panel studying the GST Bill and the Modi government had reportedly assured Jayalalithaa that her party's concerns on loss of revenue and financial autonomy will be addressed.Asked if the PM had sought Jayalalithaa's support for the GST Bill, Union minister of state for ports and highways Pon Radhakrishnan said, ""AIADMK is already cooperating with us in Parliament on several issues and GST is not the only issue that was discussed.""

&gt;* While Rajasthan IPL team adopted Ahmedabad's Motera stadium as its 'home venue', playing four matches there, the BCCI issued tenders for additional 'team franchisees' on December 17, 2009.

&gt;* Sibal alleged that in February 2010, Lalit held a closed-door meeting with industrialist Gautam Adani for bidding for an IPL team for Ahmedabad.

&gt;* Lalit introduced restrictive conditions in the bids  that the bidder have a net worth of $1 billion and give an upfront bank guarantee of Rs 460 crore  to favour Adani/Videocon group, he alleged.

&gt;* Reacting to the charge, environment minister Prakash Javadekar said Congress was resorting to ""sensationalism"" by levelling such ""untrue, baseless and unfounded"" allegations.

12,"One trait Rahul Gandhi and Modi have in common

---

&gt;* He lived up to his reputation when he chose to break his silence on Lalitgate and the Vyapam controversy at a public meeting Gaya on Sunday even though the Congress-led Opposition has been demanding that the prime minister speak up on these issues in Parliament.

&gt;* It became evident that the government was not serious about ending the deadlock when Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan suspended 25 Congress members for disorderly conduct shortly after the inconclusive all-party meeting.

&gt;* With the monsoon session set to close onAugust 13and the Congress adamant about its demand that the prime minister must speak, there is little possibility of any business being transacted in the coming three days.

&gt;* An adjournment motion entails a vote and though the National Democratic Alliance government would have sailed through it in the Lok Sabha, it did not want to concede this point as it could be seen as a sign of weakness.

&gt;* Defending his partys strategy to disrupt proceedings in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi maintained the Congress would not back off till the government offered plausible answers to the questions they had raised about the controversies involving the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday repeatedly slammed Pakistan, without naming it, in a speech at a Dubai cricket stadium packed with an Indian diaspora that roared its approval.India and the United Arab Emirates had sent out a clear signal against terror in their joint statement signed today, the PM said, and added in a swipe at Pakistan, ""The intended recipients will get the message.

&gt;* the PM asked, adding, ""People on the path of terror will have to rely on bilateral talks for a real solution.

&gt;* ""Not much later in his address, PM Modi again took on Pakistan when he said, ""We have decided to strengthen connectivity in SAARC countries.

&gt;* ""He was referring to Pakistan blocking key proposals backed by India to integrate energy grids and free up road and rail movement at a meeting in Nepal last year of the member nations of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation or SAARC.

&gt;* He mentioned every SAARC member by name except Pakistan.The PM's remarks come ahead of talks scheduled next week between the National Security Advisers of India and Pakistan and amid tension on the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir after six civilians were killed in Pakistani firing on the weekend.The Prime Minister's two-day trip to the United Arab Emirates or UAE, concluded with the mega reception billed as ""Marhaba NaMo"", at the cricket stadium filled with 40,000 people, who constantly chanted his name.The PM profusely thanked his host, the crown prince of the UAE His Highness Sheikh Mohd bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his hospitality and said, ""The love I am showered with here, the respect...is not for one individual.

Made a soap actress the HRD minister of my country whose 1 policy after the other has been to appease her Hindutva chanting masters (to give some credit, 10th exams back and detaining back are good steps), killing off German for sanskrit in KV, how fuck dumb do you have to be to support it ?
just look at some of his policies, one of the 1st actions in his govt. was raising the bar on the prices of hundreds of life saving drugs, ofcourse you dont know since his chuddy buddy Ambani owns the media in India. the land bill is another disaster, bringing back black money was a chunavi joomla, OROP again U-turn, corruption is still rampant, no lokpal, not even the jokepal. All environment clearances were fasttracked, we are going to lose our natural beauty in the country, crores were spent in the sham campaign of swach india ,nothing is swach. NGOs were targeted like we arent in India but in China or Pakistan. Information censorship has already begun.
