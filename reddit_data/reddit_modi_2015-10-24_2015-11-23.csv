&gt; * The US B-24 bomber disappeared in Arunachal Pradesh on a supply run from Kunming, China, to Chabua, Assam, on January 25, 1944, with an eight-member crew on board.The chances of their remains being recovered have vastly improved with the Modi government allowing the US military to resume search missions in Arunachal Pradesh for the remains of servicemen who died in World War II.

&gt; * The US has engaged in recovery missions across the world to bring back its war dead but efforts in Arunachal hit a roadblock after the UPA government put a stop to it in 2009, reasoning that the territory was sensitive due to ""strategic, internal political, ecological and anthropological reasons"".

&gt; * ""The Embassy of the United States of America and DPAA worked with the government of India to coordinate this opportunity for the agency to work in Arunachal Pradesh, searching for US personnel missing from World War II,"" the spokesperson said.

&gt; * ""While this moratorium has been in effect, at least two relatives of the Arunachal missing have died, including a nephew of 'Hot as Hell' co-pilot Sheldon Chambers and a brother of bombardier Robert Eugene Oxford,"" Gary Zaetz, who leads the grouping, told ET.

He's going to fight an election there. An election that will determine the future of his party.

6,"Stopping hoarding is stupid. They do this to make it look like hoarders are mafias, but whereas it is just the market. 

In agriculture, the production is spread over 2-3 months of harvest. If all crops are let into the market during this period, the prices will crash. That is why stock supplies are kept to spread consumption thoughout the year and keep prices stable.

Now, when the government imposes stocking limits, legitimate stockists become “hoarders” overnight. Forcing them to offload stocks will certainly bring immediate relief to the markets, but what will happen to supply in subsequent months is anyone’s guess. 

Additionally, this strategy also discourages further investments in warehouses/ cold storages by private stockists, inflicting deep damage to the system. In the absence of stockists, market prices of, say, pulses in the months immediately after harvest would collapse, discouraging farmers from growing them in the subsequent season. Surely the country can’t afford to have farmers take such a decision.

Thus, it is just a knee jerk reaction. NDA has failed the farmer, yet again, like everyone else. No structural reforms have taken place, none!

If Modi really wanted to do maximum governance, he should reform agriculture, which is the least free market of all. APMC, MSP, tenency laws, land cealing, disguised unemployment, it is beyond redemption, but yet it has to be redeemed to prevent mass suicide.",2015-10-24 01:40:46

On multiple occasions Modi's had to personally intevene to get him to do his job; I hope he realizes this.

Another key takeaway is the BJP's craptacular media management strategy(If there is any strategy). Like Merchant says(And I wish he'd named some names) a LOT of news editors were, are, will be hostile to Modi and there is no point trying to mollycoddle them(NDTV comes to mind) while snubbing other media who are relatively neutral.

&gt;* ""Those who had been preaching that BJP is a party confined to two and half districts of Jammu, should now accept the ground reality that it has its strong holds in Jammu, Ladakh and Kashmir, while Congress and NC are losing ground after every election"", said BJP lawmaker Shamsher Singh Manhas.BJP swept the LAHDC elections, bagging 17 of the 24 seats for which results have been declared so far.

&gt;* Congress, which had a strong presence in the last Council, managed only four seats this time while National Conference got one.

&gt;* One seat was won by an Independent.The BJP state unit celebrated the party's victory by distributing sweets and dancing to the tunes of drum beats at party headquarters here.Mr Manhas noted that the results have reassured the people that BJP is a force to reckon with along the length and breadth of Jammu and Kashmir.

&gt;* ""BJP has written a new chapter in Ladakh and the credit for the same goes to the policies of Narendra Modi-led NDA government and the ideology and principles of BJP as we have stood with the people of Ladakh during all these years when Congress and NC only played vote bank politics,"" he said.He added that the party's organizational setup in Ladakh has put its best in making the victory possible besides the participation of party's national leaders, state leadership, ministers, and legislators during the campaigning.

&gt;* The ideological and strategic drivers at the heart of New Delhi's relationship with the African continent have very much been couched in a Nehruvian discourse of southern solidarity for the creation of a more equitable and just world.

&gt;* Whilst abroad, he has instead often talked of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (a old Sanskrit saying that means that the world is one family) - a concept that many other Indian leaders had used before him - and, in describing India-Africa linkages, so far Modi has preferred to highlight Gandhi's role in cementing India-Africa relations rather than revert back to the Nehruvian discourse of Southern solidarity.

&gt;* It is also an important strategic and trading partner that can play a decisive role in Modis development goals, his 'Make in India' campaign, not to speak of New Delhi's ambitions to reform global governance institutions.

&gt;* For those, who would like to argue scientifically that non-vegetarian food is ecologically not sustainable (Pallava Bagla: PTI, October 11, 2015), they need to understand that Indian meat consumption is much smaller than in the west.

&gt;* Modi, in his maiden speech in parliament, talked about 1,200 years of servitude, a claim he repeated to his NRI constituency in Madison Square Garden, New York.

&gt;* Amit Shah made openly communal comments on Muslim butchers, after which the Election Commission banned his public meetings in UP.

&gt;* Speaking at a Dussehra event in her parliamentary constituency of Jhansi on Thursday night, the union water resources minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has Lord Rama's blessings and he would succeed in reining the prices very soon.

&gt; * We have not won seats in Kerala, the party president remarked , but I am sure this time, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there will be a change. By the next state assembly election, scheduled in 2016, Shah announced, the BJP will free Kerala of both the Congress and Communists.The obvious rhetoric in the statements apart, theres no doubt that the party is making serious attempts to make inroads into a state that has so far been out of bounds for it.While in Kerala over the weekend, the BJP president worked to firm up a political alliance with the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, a social organisation that has come to represent the Ezhava caste, the largest Hindu segment in the Kerala.

&gt; * In Kollam, Shah met the organisations general secretary Vellappally Natesan to build on the groundwork laid during a meeting between him and Natesan and his son Thushar Vellapally in Delhi in July.The alliance has the support of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  VHP president Ashok Singhal was present when Natesan met the BJP president in New Delhi.At first, the partnership will be tested in the local body elections next month, with the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, or SNDP, fielding independents with the BJPs support.If this works, the SNDP will float a political party for a full-fledged alliance with the BJP before the assembly elections.

&gt; * Over the past century, while working for the spiritual and educational uplift of the Ezhava community, the organisation has gained a significant voice in politics as well.In Kerala, Hindus constitute around 54% of the 3.3 crore population, and the Ezhavas, a backward community that gets reservations, makes up about 60% of the Hindus.

&gt; * The Guru Dharma Prachara Sabha, which was established to propagate the teachings of the social reformer, has openly spurned Natesan and warned him against using its name for political gains.The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which heads the opposition Left Democratic Front in the state, too has decried SNDPs proposed tie-up with BJP as antithetical to Narayana Gurus teachings.

Much like Christianity in the US religiosity in hinduism is strongly entwined with far-right politics (maybe even more so), we don't have anything like the current ""communist"" pope or any major public reformist figure.

&gt;* A grant synthesis of cultures, religion and language of the people belonging to different castes and communities has upheld its unity and cohesiveness despite foreign invasions including the mughals and British rule.

&gt;* This prompted them to make conquests of lands stretching from the Himalayas to the seas.

&gt;* Even in the modern era, the people celebrate each and every festival together irrespective of religion or caste, especially the national festivals where the unity or oneness displayed by the people display the indivisible character of India.

&gt;* United we stand, divided we fall. India, a land rich in socio-cultural diversities, does understand and strongly believe in the strength of unity.

87,"Sadly, this is all about politics. Sena used to be the dominant partner in the Sena-BJP alliance in Maharashtra before the rise of Modi. However, with BJP getting twice as many seats in the recent state elections than their erstwhile ally, Shiv Sena is reduced to being the minority partner in the state government, which it can't tolerate. Sena was forced to join the BJP led government by the party workers because it had been out of power for nearly 15 years. Thackeray feared a party revolt if it did not join the government. That is why you see Shiv Sena doing the things you see; because they feel that this is only way to reassert their alpha status.[1]

The crown jewel for Shiv Sena is its control of Bombay Municipal Corporation. The organization with an annual budget of nearly 5 - 6 billion dollars, is Shiv Sena's cash cow. If they lose control of that, they are politically a non entity as they use BMC gotten money to finance every operation. Guess what, the municipal elections are going to be held in 2017. The first rule of politics is always **FOLLOW THE MONEY**.

90,"This wasn't how it was meant to turn out. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the ritzy Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla hasn't exactly ignited the company's interest in India.

---

&gt; * Instead, the firm's honcho Elon Musk has disclosed that he is in talks with China to produce vehicles there and an announcement in this regard can be expected soon.Although Modi's Tesla sortie during his visit to the Bay Area in September was primarily focused on the company's powerwall battery packs with an eye towards procuring off-grid electric power technology for India, the fundamentals arise from Tesla's work on its highly-rated electric cars.

&gt; * Tesla's Model S luxury sedan, priced at $70,000 and above, is what is being lined up for production in China, possibly within three years, according to accounts in the Chinese media.Musk reportedly reckons that production costs could be cut by a third by manufacturing in China.

&gt; * Although the company employs a large number of engineers of Indian-origin, it is yet to find India interesting from the manufacturing perspective'' and the government's ""Make in India'' campaign does not seem to have caught its imagination.Even before the Modi trip, sources who scoped Tesla preparatory to the Prime Minister's visit told this correspondent the company was not really hot on manufacturing in India, although it was honored by the Indian leader's visit and interest.

&gt; * The company is named after the inventor Nikola Tesla, who, quite remarkably, is said to have engaged with Modi's own hero, Swami Vivekananda, during his visit to the US in 1893.Almost all of Tesla's current production is centred in California, and it recently opened an assembly unit in Tilburg, Netherlands.

EDIT: I also hate how the Nepalese rather than solving the crisis seem to be coming up with new conspiracy theories. Initially when the unoffical blockade was imposed, it was apparently because India didn't want a secular Nepal. Then they went on to say that India wants to 'sikkimise' Nepal. And the new conspiracy theory is that the Modi government is imposing the current blockade because of elections in Bihar and somehow after the elections end, the blockade would magically disappear overnight.

&gt; * India is being scorched by a brand of Hindutva that is ""fanning the flames of division and fear across the country"", even as the people in power have failed to unequivocally condemn recent hate crimes in the name of religion,L Ramdas, who served as chief of the Indian Navy between 1990 and 1993, said in an letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee released on Sunday.

&gt; * ""Today, as a veteran in my eighties, I am forced to hang my head in shame as I witness a series of incidents and assaults on our fellow citizens, especially minorities and dalits,"" the former navy chief wrote.He added: ""There seems to be a systematic and well-orchestrated attempt to impose a majoritarian single point agenda of creating a Hindu Rashtra in India  led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and their network of groups, which is disturbing to say the least.

&gt;* Nitish Kumars campaign manager, Prashant Kishor, who had switched over from Narendra Modis team, was in favour of breaking the alliance.

&gt;* The JD(U) campaign expected Modi to lash out at the Nitish-Lalu alliance, reminding people of Jungle Raj, promising development.

&gt;* To make sure their cadres were not demoralised by Modis arrival, they did heavy outdoor and door-to-door campaigning in Muzaffarpur for ten days leading up to Modis rally.

&gt;* I was told not to enter Bihar, I was insulted, he broke the alliance for personal ego, he discarded a Mahadalit like Jitan Ram Manjhi.

&gt;* The press conference was deliberately held the moment Modi boarded the flight for Delhi, so that he is unable to consult his advisors and chalk out an immediate response.

&gt; * The BJPs inability to decide the caste of their future chief minister, leave alone his name, is only a symptom of how its grand strategy of wooing all castes has gone awry.

&gt; * While the BJP accuses the Grand Alliance of caste politics, Sushil Modi has said that Narendra Modi is Indias first EBC chief minister.

---

&gt;* Finance minister Arun Jaitley today told NDTV that if the BJP gets the numbers to form a government in the state, the chief minister could be someone from the backward castes.

&gt;* ""The Chief Minister could belong to backward castes, since the BJP has always supported them,"" said Mr Jaitley, who is currently campaigning in Bihar.The comment comes as the party struggles to contain the furore over RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's remark -- that he favours a review of the country's reservation policy.The RSS being the ideological mentor of the BJP, Mr Bhagwat's comment has become the rallying point for BJP's rivals in the state that has a chunk of the Dalit and backward caste population.The BJP has partnered with three regional parties in Bihar who have support among the backward castes that benefit from affirmative action and form a significant portion of the voters.

&gt;* So even top BJP leaders are being seen as scurrying to control damage.But even after a clarification given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai - that there will be ""no rethink"" on reservations - Mr Bhagwat was quoted by media saying he was not against reservation, but believed quota has not benefitted the people it was meant for.Today, PM Modi, who is also campaigning in Bihar, cleared the air on reservation again , saying, ""Rights given by Babasaheb Ambedkar for the socially backward classes will never be taken away by my government.

&gt;* ""Clarifying Mr Bhagwat's comment, Mr Jaitley said, ""Mr Bhagwat did not talk of scrapping quota.

&gt;* Even on Dusshera he said he was in favour of social justice"".

Besides your question is itself shows thata non-Marathi cannot find any single good work about Sena anywhere in English/Hindi media.This itself represents intellectual bankruptcy of these people.

Give me an hour or so,will post some news. Problem is its difficult to find news on e-paper.Not many Marathi newspapers have websites.

For starters ,here is excerpts from open letter from Aditya Thackeray :

~ I really wish you looked at my tweets from @authackeray more seriously and may be were more interested in looking at our work too. The Shiv Sena, even more vociferously from 2007, has constantly raised the farmer’s issue. Of course, none of the interview questions we faced from you, grill us as a political party working on it. About the drought hit regions most recently too, right from the first major drought of recent times, 2012, we have personally visited most drought hit locations to help, not just speak or write blogs. 
In 2012, in Thane Rural (most constituencies where we don’t contest elections till recently when the alliance had a set back), we supplied water to almost 1,75,000 people in different hamlets. People had phones, not water. We’ve worked in 400 villages of Marathwada in 2013. Last year, the work carried on and this year, being a part of the Government, the work has expanded. 
From the funds raised of Uddhav ji’s exhibition of photographs, we have made a list of sensitive farmers and donated more than Rs. 3 crores as help to farmer families. More than 1000 families received grains, edible oil and essentials. The farmers facing the worst situation are being counseled against suicide. The work goes on. 
Sadly, there too we were asked questions about the so-called political rifts than our work. Is it really our fault that breaking news or open letters without any investigations (not for all channels but one or two) have become more important than the ground realities? 
Rajdeep, finally we do not work for front- page news, because it will never be so that good news is news for some. As I mentioned before, anger occurs when hopes are destroyed. All political parties do work, sadly enough, it is never news, none of us ever complain. 
May be catch up over some nice tea to discuss such issues and stats once I’m back from a tour of helping distressed farmers?~

Modi went on: “We worship Lord Ganesha. There must have been some plastic surgeon at that time who got an elephant’s head on the body of a human being and began the practice of plastic surgery.”



For the benefit of lazy redditors, let me quote your earlier justification for FekuFart^TM :

""What he said was logical and reasonable.

He had said that even though presented as fantasy, the story of Elephant's head being transplanted on a human body arguably had its origins in the domain of surgery. That someone who had seen what ancient surgery could do would come up with a story like that, cause they would then explore the possibilities of what surgery might be able to do.""

Now tell us how what you say follows from what Modi is directly quoted as saying. Not that what you say makes much sense either, but we won't waste time on that. Let us keep our focus on ""scientific"" credentials of our glorious leader, not yours.


And here's a bonus gem on Karna:

“We can feel proud of what our country achieved in medical science at one point of time,” the prime minister told a gathering of doctors and other professionals at a hospital in Mumbai on Saturday. “We all read about Karna in the Mahabharata. If we think a little more, we realise that the Mahabharata says Karna was not born from his mother’s womb. This means that genetic science was present at that time. That is why Karna could be born outside his mother’s womb.”

In the universe of the Mahabharata or Ganesha myths, the power to do so is a supernatural power that flows from the ""gods"", not from knowledge of plastic surgery or genetics. This just trivializes the myths to mundane technology from being miracles. You think the Jews would have gone around telling each other excitedly about Jesus turning grape juice into wine by adding yeast? Water into wine was the real deal, not fermentation technology. Even the gullible humans of the past had higher standards for miracles than known technology of the day.

Let us for a moment assume that Modi actually used it in the sense you imply. What was the point of making a claim that ""here's a make believe universe in which people knew to create babies outside the womb using ""genetic science"" and implant elephant heads on humans using ""plastic surgery""""? You can't really use that statement to claim that our ancestors had advanced technology, can you? At best you can claim that our ancestors had overactive imagination.

&gt;* The move is expected to benefit lakhs of aspirants every year who have to appear for written tests as well as interviews for thousands of junior-level jobs in different central government departments.Recalling his August 15 address, Modi said the practice was being abolished since it bred corruption and the poor were being looted by 'dalals' (middlemen).

&gt;* Junior-level appointments, on the other hand, are made on the basis of written tests and interviews, conducted mainly by Staff Selection Commission (SSC).Recently, minister for personnel Jitendra Singh had written to all chief ministers asking them to identify such posts which could be exempted from interviews.

---

&gt; * This will create a perception that this is a disturbed port, that companies should notgohere.What is happening in Paradip is not new.In the first quarter of 2013-'14, for instance, Adani's flagship port in Gujarat, Mundra, overtook the neighbouring port of Kandla to become India's largest port in terms of tonnage handled.Reporting on that development, this reporter found that the development was as much the result of the Adani Group taking decisions with  purpose and strategic intent  as the state government and the public sector company making a series of self-defeating decisions.Among other things, in 2000, the port unilaterally cancelled an agreement with P&amp;O Ports to set up a container terminal at Kandla.

&gt; * Capacity expansion at the port stayed far slower than at Mundra, and dredging, necessary to ensure larger vessels can berth at Kandla, was stopped.In neighbouring Gandhidham, the town which servicesKandla, the perception was that the state government  Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time  had favoured Mundra at the cost of Kandla.Since then, others have expressed similar concerns that public sector ports are being weakened to favour private ones.

&gt; * In December 2013, for instance, Raj Thackeray alleged that India's largest container port, Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, was deliberately delaying its expansion plans to help ""private ports in Gujarat"".The weakening of these public sector ports is a problem for two reasons.

&gt; * One, the Adani group today has ports and berths in virtually every coastal state  Mundra, Tuna Tekri, Hazira and Dahej in Gujarat, Mormugoa in Goa, Vizhingam in Kerala, Ennore in Tamil Nadu, Vizag in Andhra Pradesh, and now Dhamra in Odisha.News reports and industry sources say the company is in talks with Andhra Pradesh's Krishnapatnam and Gangavaram as well.If public sector ports weaken, an ever larger chunk of port traffic in India will be handled by one company.

&gt; * The government is proposing that states scrap rules mandating store closures and replace them with a model law that it's preparing, allowing restaurants, malls, theatres and local markets to remain open round the clock.Such a change will level the playing field between online and offline besides cutting down on restrictions, thus improving the ease of doing business, a stated aim of the Narendra Modi government.

&gt; * The draft will also cover the appointment of workers in this sector, taking it out of the purview of existing labour rules, he said.Under existing state laws, shops are required to remain closed on a specified day depending on traditional practices.Also, there is no provision for shops to remain open round the clock, so malls and restaurants close at midnight and local markets even earlier generally.

&gt; * ""This new law would serve as a model law for all states,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, told ET.

&gt; * Shop owners will only have to file annual returns under the model law and there won't be any need to renew licences every year, the official said.The labour ministry will begin tripartite consultations with state governments, trade unions and businesses once it finalises the draft, the official said, adding that it will then be taken to the cabinet.

---

&gt;* Upset and angry with the attacks on minorities and Dalits under the rule of the current government, former Navy chief Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas has written an open letter to President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemning the incidents.

&gt;* This in turn has resulted in a dangerous pattern of mob behaviour including intimidating and lynching people merely on the basis of rumours  in total disregard for the established rule of law.

&gt;* Such action alone will have a salutary deterrent effect on all those, be they fringe or mainstream, who are speaking and acting in many voices that are totally against and inimical to, our traditional ethos and the syncretic culture of our country and its people.

&gt;* This diversity and unique nature of our society and people can probably never be replicated anywhere on this earth  and for this reason alone, the concept of a single religious identity or mono culture represents an insult to this ancient civilisation and heritage.

&gt;* It is our bounden duty that the elected Government of this nation must honour the rights of every citizen of this land as amply spelt out in the Preamble of the Constitution and further elaborated in the Directive Principles of State policy.

&gt;* In addition to developing the northeast, Modi has sided with the U.S. in calling for stability in the South China Sea and bolstered ties with Sri Lanka after it voted out a pro-China government.

&gt;* The Tibet autonomous region today boasts more than 7,000 kilometers of highways, all-weather road and rail links to Chinas heartland, five airfields and a fiber optic network that connects nearly all towns, according to Delhi Policy Group.

&gt;* Modi has allocated more resources to build schools, clinics and small bridges in the state, and is planning to boost telecommunication and transport networks, Rijiju said.

&gt;* ""The Chinese government has never recognized the so-calledArunachal Pradesh unilaterally established by India,"" Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said in a Feb. 21 statement after Modi gave a speech in the state capital.

&gt; * The English media mafia's strategy is simple: First, ratchet up small incidents as big issues, keep adding up unrelated negative developments and build hysteria, demand statements from the PM and lay a trap for him.

267,"R Jagannathan has a personal bias in favour of Modi, but he's raising a lot of legitimate points that have become the minority opinion lately.

&gt;Three failures will cost him plenty and could conceivably derail his administration: A pathetic communications strategy — assuming there is one at all; a failure to surround himself with competent people, including friendly critics; and an inability to distinguish real friends from 'frenemies' (friends with negative agendas).

&gt;Modi's communication strategy is simply not working. Making a rousing election speech is Bihar and speaking from the heart at a Mann ki Baat session are, of course, important, but they can achieve little when your rivals have a better strategy and, moreover, control the mainstream English media, with allies in the powerful international media, the Indian and international Left, and the Christian Right in the US.

&gt;The English media mafia's strategy is simple: First, ratchet up small incidents as big issues, keep adding up unrelated negative developments and build hysteria, demand statements from the PM and lay a trap for him. If he makes one, demand more action and point out any failure anywhere in the country as more talk than action; if he stays silent, that will be considered damning in itself. Modi's enemies have the advantage: If any allegation sticks, they will claim vociferous vindication; if it doesn't, they will shrug it off and look for the next incident to collar him. 

&gt;Nothing illustrates this better than the so-called ""church attacks"" in Delhi and rape of a nun in West Bengal last year and early this year. Most of the Delhi ""attacks"" turned out to be random events, and the Bengal one turned out to have been perpetrated by a Bangladeshi. But no apologies were given for this irresponsible muck-raking.

By saying these things aloud Jagannathan's probably burned a lot of bridges with mainstream media and their patrons in the 'secular' parties. I wish Modi would hear it. Last year when he became PM there was a rumour that he was looking to hire Jagannathan as his media advisor. What a lost opportunity.",2015-10-26 21:06:58

MSM considers him a chhaddiwala, a rightwinger. So he can join only places where there already is a clear rightwing bias already - others wont touch him. He himself has been telling people that this is his last job etc.

For a right winger, though, he is one of the saner voices. And though he takes Modi / BJP / RSS sides easily, he is not really one. It is better to call him extremely anti-Congress and anti-Left.

And how accurate the comment is: Congress plus a cow. No change in policies, no institutional development, but ya beef is all we can talk about. Bravo. 

If Modi had even a shred of magnanimity, he would stop to think what makes Arun Shourie say such harsh words and then get Mr. Shourie to guide him through the mess he is creating. 

Ah, one can only wish. ",2015-10-26 22:26:06
277,"I was a journalist, ages back. Journalist by education and training. Left all that more than a decade back. Most of my friends are journalists in Mumbai and Delhi.

Yes, there is a left bias, but it is better described as a liberal bias. This is easy to understand.

Media, worldwide, largely aligns itself against the conservative party. The socially conservative party. So in US, media will largely oppose the Republicans, in UK support Labour, and in India oppose BJP. One reason is that media people are by nature, liberal. Liberals are the ones who bother about writing, investigation, and come from the Arts (changing now). Also, being in the media can easily change a conservative person into a centrist or liberal. Media men almost all drink, eat non veg, have intercaste and inter religious marriages, divorce, wear what they want, are pretty assertive about individual rights over the rights of the community or society... because that is how they are.

It is easy for them to be pro abortion, anti racism and pro-women's rights in US, and anti Beef ban, censorship etc in India. These are mostly Liberal positions, not Left positions.

Most media people have also turned to the left at some point in their lives, and have got disillusioned. The Left, media largely accepts, is a fascist, controlling group - even if they speak for the poor and the media men identify with that part. The nature of the Left is to control, and media hates control.

Imagine an India without BJP or RSS. The media then would be opposed to the Congress. In fact, prior to BJP coming to power (or becoming really strong), the media was almost consistently anti-Congress. The Indian Express made its name being antiCongress and anti Indira Gandhi. The mediamen are largely turning to the economically right now, though when BJP gets on its socially conservative bandwagon, they abandon BJP rightaway. Pre-elections, most senior media houses (and editors) were optimistic - a development focused Modi means good business for media. Did not work out that way. (Media is also pretty sure that Congress would try to fuck them over given a chance). If there were no BJP, media would be anti-Congress. In fact, media stopped regular, sharp cricitism of Islamic fundamentalism only when they found its helping the BJP.

Another reason for the dislike is, personal contact. All media people come face to face across party chiefs, top brass, MPs and MLAs, corporation chairmans and so on. Also they meet businessmen regularly. The party leaders often talk openly to them and they hear pretty shocking stuff from the hourses' own mouths (off the record). And the journalists dislike what BJP leaders tell them more than what Congress leaders or others tell them. They way they see it is, when the worst of both parties are taken to a hypothetical extreme, one is a ""party of corrupt assholes who could even murder for a victory"" and the other ""party of murderous assholes"". You can see why they oppose one more than the other.

Basically, media would love a party like Lok Satta if such a party existed at the national level. Or if BJP did not have a socially conservative side, and was pure economic right. In the absence of that, they are gentler towards Congress and clearly opposed to BJP.

292,"&gt; Media orientation aside where do they draw the line? Jagannathan says that the media at present is too unfair and extreme in attacking the Modi government, even to the extent of manufacturing issues out of routine things. How do they justify that?

Media would criticise Modi, that was the most predictable thing, right? If you think a man, his party, and the party's parent organisation are extremely dangerous to the country, its a matter of time before the criticism starts. 

Manufacturing, yes. This definitely happens. Mostly in TV though. But TV journalists are a different breed. They have no choice but to out-Arnab the Arnab Goswami. There, even the smartest ones have to think like an idiot - how to make everything exciting, sensational, controversial... newspaper and magazine journalists usually stay a mile away from them. Over time, TV is getting disgusting. Most newspaper and magazine journalists do not watch TV as a rule!

&gt; Also regarding personal contact, in the UPA era media were apparently so thick with the ruling party 

I was not surprised. Journalists have been used for stuff like this forever. That's the price of getting insider information. You get some, you give some. Watch House of Cards to see some great examples of this. Passing a message to another leader etc are routine stuff. However, its usually for that one big story. Say a journalist comes across a huge story - he will dump his closest leader in an instant. I can't remmeber who broke the 2G scam or the coal scam, but they were all anti BJP journalists I think. 

The same thing would happen, is happening, to a smaller extent with BJP too, right now. Much larger scale, during Vajpayee days.

&gt;  If not, could that also be a reason why they are more critical and negative about it?

Of course. Quite possible. My point was, its not really needed, they have enough reasons already (as they are liberals and this is a conservative party! ) It is probably additional motivation, quite possible!

Also, half the stuff that the media plays up is from one BJP leader trying to undercut another.

End of the day, there is no meeting ground between a socially conservative party and a liberal media. Rest are details and nuances. ",2015-10-26 23:23:43
293," 

Well, going by your own example, the media were pretty positive and supportive of the UPA for 7-8 years before those scams broke. They even went to the extent of covering up scandals to keep the UPA from breaking up(IBN cancelling Cash for Votes sting) and doing backdoor negotiations for UPA leaders(Radiagate).

They only changed tact from 2011 onwards because after Radiagate exposed their own links to government corruption and with new scams being exposed every month they couldn't keep silent any longer especially with the way Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement got traction.

But if you'll recall the media coverage from 2013-14 you'll find that as soon as Modi emerged on the national stage to take advantage of all the backlash against the UPA the media shifted much of their focus from scrutinizing the UPA's scams and performance to scrutinizing Modi and the Gujarat government's performance.

I remember wondering in late 2013/early 2014 why, when the elections were basically a referendum for the sitting government, why the media was making it look like a referendum on the Opposition leader.",2015-10-26 23:39:06

In fact, prior to BJP coming to power (or becoming really strong), the media was almost consistently anti-Congress. The Indian Express made its name being antiCongress and anti Indira Gandhi. The mediamen are largely turning to the economically right now, though when BJP gets on its socially conservative bandwagon, they abandon BJP rightaway. Pre-elections, most senior media houses (and editors) were optimistic - a development focused Modi means good business for media. Did not work out that way. (Media is also pretty sure that Congress would try to fuck them over given a chance). If there were no BJP, media would be anti-Congress.

---

&gt;* Ever since the Modi government came to power last summer, the Indian security establishment has acquired a new vigour in hunting Indias enemy number one  Dawood Ibrahim.

&gt;* His role was crucial to the Mumbai police and intelligence agencies that were overwhelmed by the communal flare-ups and the deep tentacles of Dawood gang in the commercial capital and global financial markets.

&gt;* The most vivid record of Rajans links to the Indian agencies came in 2005, when his associate Vicky Malhotra was intercepted on a Delhi road while travelling with Ajit Doval, the present National Security Advisor.

&gt;* A U.S. embassy cable that emerged later said: The media originally speculated that the IB wanted to use Malhotra to target and kill Ibrahim if he travelled to Dubai to attend the reception [for his daughters wedding].

&gt;* Many are wondering if Rajan was acting out a script to secure himself in an Indian jail, rather than roam around perpetually haunted by threat from his rivals, especially Dawood.

&gt;* Allthe scourges we deplore so muchtoday were unleashed during the various rules of the Congress, especially during Indira Gandhis time  casteism, communalism (under the veil of secularism), the Emergency, the bubble of garibi hatao, corruption, scams, personality cult, the curse of dynastic politic, and ultimately the Sikh genocide.

&gt;* But to contend that intellectuals who were taciturn then have suddenly woken up to protest during Modi raj is a lie that is totally in step with the standards of the BJP and Sangh Parivar.

&gt;* The eminent Gujarati author Manubhai ""Darshak"" Pancholi had warned about the excesses of the Congress in his celebrated novel Socratesand public speeches even before the Emergency was declared.

&gt;* Grassroots thinkers such as Ram Manohar Lohia and JP contributed immensely to making this movement robust, which ironically ended up benefiting the Sangh Parivar and its ragtag affiliates.

&gt;* It would do well to remind ourselves that even during that time, the intellectuals were not tight-lipped  not even when Rajiv Gandhi uttered his grossly insensitive statement When a big tree falls, the earth shakes in the wake of the Sikh pogrom.

332,"I would disagree on a few things here,

The bulk of our SME's are in the [unorganised sector](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-09/news/39834857_1_smes-workforce-small-and-medium-enterprises). This is clearly visible in a survey which established the fact that 90% of SME's do not even have access to the internet. Clearly, they are struggling to get online, so hardly sophisticated CAD manufacturers. 

&gt;&gt;oo many firms stay small, unregistered and un-incorporated in the unorganised sector so that they can avoid taxes and regulations. ""The firms have little incentive to invest in upgrading skills of largely temporary workers or in investing in capital equipment,"" says the latest Economic Survey.

As to the rest of your post,

&gt;I think you under estimate how many of these people get stifled due to the permit raj and red tape.

50 years of Nehruvian legacy cannot be wished away, not even in a decade. NDA has already dismantled the inspector raj, pushing for single window clearances, ramped up spending in infra. Aside from these moves, multiple measures both in the 2014 and 2015 budgets targeting SME's.

&gt;The Budget has delivered on some pressing issues for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as improving funding, increasing demand through boost to infrastructure-building and addressing the inverted duty structure in some key segments. However, in setting a long-term direction and vision for the sector, the annual policy exercise has weighed in heavy on intent but light on specifics.

&gt;The FINANCE Minister has announced several initiatives to give a boost to the infrastructure sector, whose benefits are likely to trickle down to MSMEs. Most infrastructure projects in power, road and railways sub-contract various project and engineering activities to MSMEs, which are a major employer of skilled as well as unskilled labour.

&gt;Credit flow and availability of timely and cost-effective funding options are critical to growth of MSMEs. Further, a large majority (62 per cent) of small business owners belong to SC/ST and OBC backgrounds. The decision to set up ‘Mudra Bank’, a refinance agency to be launched with a corpus of Rs 20,000 crore, and a credit guarantee fund of Rs 3,000 crore with directed lending to MSMEs will address the working capital and funding shortfall that these businesses face. It is imperative that the government complete the process of setting up this bank in a time-bound manner.

&gt;CRISIL has estimated that as much as a quarter of MSMEs’ turnover remains struck as receivables and delay in payments takes considerable toll on their ability to fund business operations. The budget seeks to address this issue with the creation of a trade receivables platform to FINANCE receivables from corporates and other buyers, through financial institutions. This will help strengthen the liquidity position of MSMEs, reducing the requirement of working capital funding.

&gt;Development of a comprehensive bankruptcy code by 2015-16 will facilitate easy exit from sick or non-profitable ventures. The ease of entry and exit from business is likely to encourage interest in entrepreneurship.

[source](http://www.moneycontrol.com/sme-stepup/news/budget_2015_whats_in_it_for_msmes-1317923.html).

Look at the Survey posted here, and these are pretty much the key woes of MSME's.

* Infrastructure or lack of it thereof - Electricity, Water, Waste Management, Ports, Roads, 
* Horrible labour laws
* Lack of manufacturing clusters outside of T1 cities


This govt is pushing hard on almost all of these items.

&gt;He should allow more people other than Adani to setup ports in India. And allow a free for all in that sector.

I am surprised you are saying this. This is more of a typical ""crony capitalism"" type accusation floated around here. Vizhinjiam's tender was floated by the UPA, it is in a Congress run state and nobody applied for it.

How on earth is Modi even responsible for it? That aside, Mundra is by far the most efficient port we have, and I see no harm if Adani sets up more ports in India.

335,"A few points , then you decide.

1.SME's are not unorganised, they are small and many don't scale, the reason they can't scale isn't because of a lack of poor adoption of technology but rather a. lack of availability of technology (many who want to import the tech can't due to high import taxes, and massive amounts of red tape around importing machinery) . Notice how 45% are in manufacturing.

2. Most of them can't scale due to massive amounts of red tape

a. You say this is years of Nehruvian legacy but let me give you a key example of how Modi is responsible. A lot of these SME's are stuck in contract disputes, whether land,, suppliers and of course labour etc.

So to enforce a contract in India it takes 1400 days and 46 procedures have to be met. In Singapore that number comes down to 21, in the states 34. 

Amitabh Kant gave an interview that the govt recognised this was the single biggest issue facing ease of doing business and the PMO had taken note. 

As of late its sitting gathering dust and no one is working on it.

We tank 186/189 in this area.

There are so many other areas . I always mention single window clearances it takes 186 days to start a business in India 24 days in Hong Kong. 

All of these areas the govt could work on.

Then you have tax etc etc.

You also have making it easier to access credit which Arun Shourie spoke about vis a vie banking reforms (I look back and I see the article mentions this). So this was one of SHourie's key criticisms

Labour laws aren't anywhere near as stifling as people believe them to be most factories are used to dealing with labour and anyways just because its hard to hire and fire doesn't mean it doesn't happen. On ground reality is people easily hire and fire because most labourers can't enforce contracts and are anyways hired on part time basis.

You're nitpicking with confirmation bias based articles.

The only good policy that will come to fore in the future as of now will be a pet project of Arun Jaitleys where he said we need to remove all the write offs for corporations and bring the tax rate down this will be done by 2017 if all goes well. It will make taxes simpler and help.

But then you have things like MAT and shit which need to be done away with.

**My last point would be if you think red tape is not the biggest issue and permit raj isn't the biggest issue then I would have you look at how many e commerice industries have come up and how all of them are run by non traditional families unlike every other industry surely this is a great example of what I say**",2015-10-27 12:34:48

337,"I wanted to actually correct you.

See, every single item of our Export / Import trade is via container ships and they need container trucks to cart them around. Sure, raw material like coal etc come under ""break bulk"" and are how you describe.

Without a container, liner companies won't even accept your shipment.

Our problem is also not in the terminals.

Basically shipping in (or out) is like this.

Vessel Docks &gt; Lands at the terminal &gt; Gantry Cranes unload the stuff onto waiting trucks (or stock it in the yard at a massive fee) &gt; Trucks cart it to the port authority area &gt; Customs &gt; Uses road network or rail network (intermodal) to then ship it onward &gt; Crosses state border (some more tax authorities) and finally reaches the consignee who then dispatches stuff to stores and /u/spaceman2121 gets his hands on the shiny new TV / Dildo whatever.

The problem is, our terminals (usually outsourced) are world class. Our logistic firms are brilliant.

Where we choke are in the,

* Port authority - these are hugely corrupt, space is a massive premium and super choked

* Customs - A customs manager in Nava Sheva (sal structure is around Rs 30k a month tops) drives around in a C class. Nuff said. This is also the cause for major frustrations. As a sample of containers have to be inspected, and well based on if you grease palms or no, your containers might never be inspected or inspected all the fucking time. Once a honest customer imported Fish from Japan. Refused to grease palms. Fucking container was stuck in Vizag for 4 months. While it was a Reefer (giant chilled containers), a bad power outage meant power was lost for an hour (though why the inbuilt gens didn't run, we don't know, customer suspected sabotage). He gets his container and all the fish is rotted and stinky. He dumped the whole load. This is just one such incident. 100's and 1000's happen every fucking day.

* Road / Rail infra - Nuff said. It takes 30 bloody hours to cross 2 state borders.

&gt; * The bottom line is, why am I forced to maintain a dry cow or an old bull all its life without expecting any return from it (except, of course, dung, urine and Methane farts, which contribute to global warning).

351,"Adani Group is aggressively expanding its footprint along India's coastline. The latest public sector port to face the heat is Paradip in Odisha.

---

&gt; * This will create a perception that this is a disturbed port, that companies should notgohere.What is happening in Paradip is not new.In the first quarter of 2013-'14, for instance, Adani's flagship port in Gujarat, Mundra, overtook the neighbouring port of Kandla to become India's largest port in terms of tonnage handled.Reporting on that development, this reporter found that the development was as much the result of the Adani Group taking decisions with  purpose and strategic intent  as the state government and the public sector company making a series of self-defeating decisions.Among other things, in 2000, the port unilaterally cancelled an agreement with P&amp;O Ports to set up a container terminal at Kandla.

&gt; * Capacity expansion at the port stayed far slower than at Mundra, and dredging, necessary to ensure larger vessels can berth at Kandla, was stopped.In neighbouring Gandhidham, the town which servicesKandla, the perception was that the state government  Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time  had favoured Mundra at the cost of Kandla.Since then, others have expressed similar concerns that public sector ports are being weakened to favour private ones.

&gt; * In December 2013, for instance, Raj Thackeray alleged that India's largest container port, Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, was deliberately delaying its expansion plans to help ""private ports in Gujarat"".The weakening of these public sector ports is a problem for two reasons.

&gt; * One, the Adani group today has ports and berths in virtually every coastal state  Mundra, Tuna Tekri, Hazira and Dahej in Gujarat, Mormugoa in Goa, Vizhingam in Kerala, Ennore in Tamil Nadu, Vizag in Andhra Pradesh, and now Dhamra in Odisha.News reports and industry sources say the company is in talks with Andhra Pradesh's Krishnapatnam and Gangavaram as well.If public sector ports weaken, an ever larger chunk of port traffic in India will be handled by one company.

The internet bullies are not government people, most of the times. They are a mix of trolls, idiots, self appointed spokesman, people with personal grudge, attention seekers, PR agents and so on. 

Secondly, who doesn't get bullied/criticized/abused on internet including Modi. Internet (social media) has become a free for all where every single public figure, journalists is abused or trolled or criticized. You show me one tweet bullying Rajdeep and I will show you ten bullying Smriti Irani. 

Third, even when government minsters or bjp leaders criticize media on internet or elsewhere it can't be construed as suppression. If they don't agree with media's coverage, rightly or wrongly, they also have a right to free speech. Only if the government threatens the journalists/media and people we can call it suppression.

375,"Such a load of hogwash and conjecture.

Govt run ports are a horrible mess, and I mean absolute, terrible mess. They are heavily unionised, vessel turn around times are horrible. Mundra has a turnaround of 15-18 hours for a standard Feeder Vessel. The turn around in Chennai port is 4 days, and in Nava Sheva it is 6 days. Vizag is at 4 days.

3 extra days in port is a lot of money - bunker costs, salary costs, vessels are not making their other calls on time, they can't be rerouted back for another loop which means more money loss. Now keep in mind, feeders routing from Colombo make about 3-4 stops in our east coast and feeders from Jebel Ali make 2-3 stops in our west coast.

At an average 3 day turn around time, that is anything between 9-12 days for the East coast and 6-9 days at the west coast. Adani (and L&amp;T for that matter) by opening posts across the coasts can cut this down to 3 days max (as compared to 12). 9 fucking days in port means millions saved for liner companies EVERY FUCKING trip.

Liner companies like Maersk, MSC or CMA do not just shift ports because ""Modi hand"". Every decision, every voyage is calculated down to the last penny. Improve turn around times and watch the business come back to these shitty ports.

This is sheer efficiency and free market economy at work. Chennai port is starving because the govt has refused to build an overland e-way connecting the industrial hub to the port. Takes a good 5-10 days to get into the fucking port. L&amp;T's Kattupali? Has road, rail and all manner of intermodal, hell yes business will shift there. It is an absolute no brainer.

How many of you here use govt owned companies if a private sector alternative is available? Yeah, that is the answer.

I work in this line and it is frustrating working with these assholes who run port trusts. Trust me, we take all our business to Mundra and will do so willingly because...it saves us money. That is the bottomline.

&gt;* Found on a train that had crossed the border from India into the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, Geeta remained in Pakistan under the care of the country's largest welfare organisation, the Edhi Foundation in Karachi for more than a decade.

&gt;* Planned talks between national security advisers from India and Pakistan were canceled in August hours before they were due to start, dashing hopes the two might tackle the violence that many fear could one day spark a nuclear showdown.

&gt;* Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his speech at the 70th session of UN General Assembly earlier this month, presented a four point peace initiative to resolve all issues with India.

&gt; * TNA: Days before polling for the crucial third phase in Bihar, the BJP poached Bhim Singh, an important leader of the 'extremely backward castes' (EBCs) from JD(U) while making it clear that it was all set to project PM Narendra Modi as the tallest ""backward leader"".The induction of Bhim Singh midway through the polls is to make an important statement to the coalition of castes which is expected to make the difference between victory and defeat.In the process, the party blinked on Modi's scathing criticism of Bhim Singh, a one-time aide of CM Nitish Kumar and minister in his government, for making light of the killing of a jawan in cross-border shelling by Pakistan in 2013.

&gt; * Besides a signal to EBCs who together account for one-fourth of the electorate, the party also values the move as a refutation of the claim of its 'secular' opponents of a consolidation of 'backwards' against the BJP, a prospect that will mean the electoral annihilation of the party.Significantly, while announcing Bhim Singh's entry, Sushil Modi flaunted Narendra Modi's accomplishment as the first 'EBC' politician to become PM on the strength of his appeal among people.

&gt; * The BJP has several EBC faces -Prem Kumar, Ram Chandra Chandravanshi (Jharkhand minister) and now Bhim Singh,"" Modi said.

&gt; * On PM Narendra Modi's EBC connection, he said, ""EBC and Dalits are solidly behind PM Narendra Modi.

&gt;* But these days there is an intense rivalry going on between Laluji and Nitishji on many issues - protecting the criminals, doing nepotism, breaking off from truth.

&gt;* He felt that he will call some courtiers and journalists, recite poems and defeat Lalu by starting a new form of entertainment.

&gt;* Keep writing poems on all this and keep shedding tears,"" Modi said.He was apparently referring to Kumar breaking ties with BJP in June 2013 after being together for 17 years following Modi's appointment as his party's campaign chief for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and then joining hands with his arch rival RJD chief Lalu Prasad for the assembly elections in Bihar.Asserting that leaders of the the anti-BJP grand alliance have ""panicked over impending defeat"", Modi accused them of taking to ""lies, cheating and betrayal"" and repeatedly attacked Nitish over his meeting with a tantrik (occultist).Terming Nitish's meeting with the tantrik a sign of ""lack of confidence"" in the grand alliance, Modi wondered whether such ""tantra-mantra can save them"".Modi said people approach occultists only when they feel all roads are closed to them.The Prime Minister, who has often accused Kumar of ""arrogance"" said, ""Where does this arrogance take a person?

&gt;* ""Reviving his attack on Kumar for his purported promise to provide electricity to every village in the state, Modi alleged the chief minister did not fulfil his commitment and power comes to many places after interval of days.Modi promised electricity to all villages by 2019 and to all homes in Bihar by 2022.Alleging that Nitish and Lalu do not know how to run a government, Modi said he fears the money given by the Centre might have remained unused in banks or ""embezzled"".He cited funding for a number of schemes by Centre to claim that the Bihar government was not able to spend the money extended to the state.

387,"&gt; Yeah I get she is a 'true' liberal and shit, but lets not act like she has got the whole world figured out man. Here she says that religious people are secular? I mean thats an oxymoron if I've ever seen one. The word secular means devoid of religion. Thats like saying retarded people are intellectuals.

She is referring to how it is in practice. The 'secular' discourse in India has become so politicized that we've got people like Muslim League leaders, the Owaisis, Azam Khan and various clerics preaching secularism and hobnobbing 'secular' circles. Remember when books were released about how 26/11 was an RSS conspiracy and the book launches were attended by the likes of Digvijay Singh and Mahesh Bhatt?

&gt;Also, I love how every BJP fanboi here has been quick as shit to call out the writers and shit and call them intolerant just because a 'true' liberal like Taslima Nasreen has given you the free pass to do so. The writers were protesting about their perception of rising intolerance in the country and now you call that peaceful protest intolerant? Fuckin hell, whats intolerant is that women are beaten for going to clubs/people murdered for eating beef/couples harassed for Valentine day shit/beating up people for transporting cows.

Have you even paid attention to the criticisms by Taslima or anyone else? It's because this recent outrage is selective and manufactured. We've got people pretending(like last year's Church attacks hoopla) that all this started only since May 2014 and Modi becoming PM is directly responsible and that his government is the only place to direct our anger. Coincidentally most of these guys are longitme Congress loyalists who never gave a rat's ass about communalism or fascist governments till now, when Bihar elections have started.

In parallel we see cases like some Maharashtra polcieman getting stabbed by a Muslim youth, or the Moodbidri murder, and these are quietly ignored because it doesn't suit the narrative of how somehow there is a sudden rise in Hindu fundamentalism only when the fact is nothing has changed between the past 20-30 years and now beyond the current media coverage.

&gt;I get how Muslim appeasement has most definitely had a huge impact on her life and career but honestly with the ideas that she spouts, she'd have to be naive to think that shit would fly with our Hindu people.

At the end you're just giving the same whataboutism you attacked 'BJP fanboys' for. Taslima knows Hindu fundamentalism and has criticized them as well. In fact go back to articles about her back when she was still living in Bangladesh and she was already critical of Hindutva even then and claimed how Hindu groups had threatened her for some of her utterances.",2015-10-27 21:08:35

391,"'Beef' Back on Kerala House Menu After Day of Protests Over Delhi Police 'Raid'

---

&gt;* Politics over beef found a new address today as the Kerala House in Delhi took buffalo meat off its menu after a ""raid"" by 20 policemen over a complaint from a fringe group.After a day of protests against what many saw as bullying, Kerala House decided to bring back buffalo meat, sending a message that reinforced Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy's strong words in a letter to the Prime Minister.

&gt;* ""I would like to inform you that the Kerala House staff canteen serves authentic vegetarian and non-vegetarian Kerala cuisine and the items in the menu are entirely within law,"" Mr Chandy wrote to PM Narendra Modi, accusing the Delhi Police of overstepping its brief.Sources told NDTV that the Prime Minister's Office has sought details of the Delhi Police action from the home ministry.On Monday evening, the official guest house of Kerala in the capital swarmed with policemen after a call from activists of the Hindu Sena group, who had visited the canteen and noticed ""beef fry"" scribbled in Malayalam on a handwritten menu.Defending their alacrity in responding to the complaint, the police said they acted for the sake of law and order; the Hindu Sena was involved in an ink attack last week on Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker Engineer Rashid, over his beef party in Srinagar.

&gt;* ""We know no irregularities will take place at Kerala House, but it was our duty to investigate the matter since the complaint was on a serious issue... We had no option but to react very fast, as it could have been a situation which would lead to a communal flare up,"" said Delhi Police chief Bassi in the evening.He added that if the Kerala House registers a complaint, ""we will conduct an inquiry against the Hindu Sena men"".The canteen staff explained that it serves only buffalo meat, which is not illegal, even though the term ""beef"" is used.Two more Chief Ministers weighed in on the controversy.Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerji also tweeted.Beef is at the centre of a nationwide debate after recent mob-killings over allegations of beef-eating and cow slaughter.

That is true.

Media is like all other tools. In the right environment, it is great. Otherwise, so-so to bad. 

Wherever media exists, a good number complain about them, their bias etc. Its normal.

&gt; bias and slant against the spirit of objectivity 

Yes. But what do you do, when media largely thinks they have to do it, for the sake of the country? The vast majority of them, are Hindus, and proudly so. But they are also liberal, and from the point of view of liberals, parties like BJP (and CPM) are dangerous for democracy itself. Will you be objective, if you fear that by being fully objective, your country will be endangered? They think they did not recognise the danger posed by BJP in 2002 and 1992.

A parallel would be, would you be liberal towards the illiberal? Would you allow a terrorist free speech rights? That is the stand taken by the media. And BJP knows it. In fact, BJP knows media would turn much friendlier if they can dump RSS. Even more friendly if the party itself stands up for more individual freedom. Some BJP leaders tell journalists they want to but they can't, because then they won't have the support of RSS to win elections. (In fact, many journalists believe RSS is deliberately ensuring that Modi's development agenda gets submerged in its Hindutva agenda. Because if the development agenda goes ahead fast, Modi would not need RSS like it happened in Gujarat.)",2015-10-27 22:17:15

Firstly,Its not a mass killing or riot.Religious tensions do happen on smallest of things and people from both religion commit such crimes.You can't equate it with massacres and heavy casualities like from Terrorist attacks.

And secondly,there were active outrages and condemnations among people on the Daddri incident.

---

&gt;* Arun Shourie, who launched a stinging attack on the Narendra Modi-led government, is no longer a member of the BJP, the party said on Tuesday.

&gt;* The party sought to dismiss the criticism of its one-time influential leader who was also a minister in the previous NDA government.

&gt;* Shourie, a strong supporter of Modi during the Lok Sabha election campaign last year, had said the Centre believes that managing economy means managing the headlines and that people had started recalling the days of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

&gt;* The way to characterise policies of the government is -- Congress scaled plus a cow, he had said.

&gt;* Rejecting the charge, Naidu said there has been no scam, no scandal and not even one mistake under the government and BJP had been winning elections across the country.

&gt;* Radha Mohan Singh and Ramvilas Paswan had to hold a press conference, in Patna, to transfer the blame of rising prices of pulses on inaction of Nitish government.

There are only a few at the top, in the media, who I think have that kind of insight into who they are, and why they do what they do. And they do not speak of it. 

The rest think they are being objectively biased (very funny) against BJP. Its a delusion. I am sure one can make them say it after a few drinks, but they are not likely to volunteer such self-analysis.

A lot of them actually had the hope that Modi would not give them any reasons to go against BJP. You know, they hoped and prayed and offered careful support pre Elections. Post Elections, they are realising that if MMS had the UPA as the weight around his neck, Modi has the Sangh organisations. And both are helpless really... in managing their bosses.

You saw Shourie's reaction, right? That is the feeling of almost all top editors of financial dailies and business journalists at the moment. They were the closest to supporting Modi. 

Tavleen is disappointed, so is Bhalla, so is Rahul Joshi, so is Jaggi, Ninan... The ones who were most likely to support BJP are backing away. So you can guess how the rest of the journalists are!

*Anyway coming back to our original point. End of the day, a liberal media cannot support a socially conservative party. Yes, they are not objective about that, and I doubt if they have the ability to really see they are not objective!*

If Modi could keep a tight leash on the conservative agenda for 5 years, then a good chunk of media would be singing his praises today. That's what I thought he would do.

&gt;* On April 30, 2014, on Modi's taking a selfie and addressing a press conference, Varma had complained about the breach of poll code before the Election Commission (EC) of India.

&gt;* The EC asked the Gujarat government to book Modi and responsible journalists under Section 126 of the Representation of People Act.

&gt;* Meanwhile, the city crime branch investigated the case and gave a clean chit to Modi, which was upheld by a metropo litan court.

&gt;* After the lower court rejected Varma's demand, his counsel KR Koshti argued that the magistrate had passed the order on the basis of inadequate details.

&gt; * KOLKATA | MUMBAI: For the first time, the grey market for a smartphone is buzzing even after the official launch in the country as cheaper prices of the device offered through unauthorised channels attract customers.Apple's latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus phones are selling out fast in grey market hubs such as Mumbai's Heera Panna, New Delhi's Gaffar Market, Kolkata's Fancy Market and even on eBay, thanks to high official prices of the devices due to a taxation change and a softening rupee.The government increased the duty on imported smartphones to 11.5 per cent this year to encourage its 'Make in India' agenda.

&gt; * The iPhone 6s Plus 128GB model was available for Rs 80,180 on eBay compared with its official India price of Rs 92,000.In the grey market hubs, the phones were selling for about Rs 5,000-11,000 less than the official prices.A section of the industry said the busy grey market is an indicator that Apple should start assembling its devices in India, which was discussed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the US last month.

&gt; * Foxconn Technology Group, the company that makes iPhones for Apple, has started manufacturing smartphones for China's Xiaomi and US phone brand InFocus at its plant in Andhra Pradesh.So high is the grey market demand in India that dealers at Mumbai's Heera Panna market and Mohammed Ali Road say there is a shortage of iPhone 6s devices and they are forced to prebook them.

&gt; * ""We generally take two days to source the new iPhones,"" a dealer at Heera Panna said.Sensing opportunity, some sellers at Gaffar Market and Kolkata's Air-Conditioned Market have cut discounts.

---

&gt;* A fresh controversy is brewing over the way the Centre is planning to clear the diversion of a whopping 19,256 hectares of reserve forest area in Krishna and Guntur districts for the new capital, Amaravati.

&gt;* The Andhra Pradesh Government has been lobbying the Centre to clear up green hurdles to make this land available to its urbanisation projects.

&gt;* They allege that the good political equation between the State and Central Governments is being to put to wrong use to destroy forests at a time when the worldwide trend is to preserve whatever is left.

&gt;* Further, the ability of the Forest Department to achieve such a gigantic task of taking up plantation in 40,000 hectares runs against its own poor track record.

&gt;* A plethora of instances are being cited that show that afforestation efforts tend to fall short of the state objective: either governments go back on their promise of providing land for afforestation or earmark land involved in legal tangles, or the Forest Department ends up unable to take up full-scale plantation even if it meant poor choice of species.

&gt;He has the access to all the files. Do not get confused.The man is neither Amit Shah or Arun Jaitley. He is Narendra Modi's old-time capitalist friend from Ahmedabad, Gautam Bhai Adani.


&gt;He has been spotted with Modi in lifts of hotels; he has been seen in the PMs suite
