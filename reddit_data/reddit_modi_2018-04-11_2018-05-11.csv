0,"&gt; Tamils voted for Jaya

If people had known about Jaya's deteriorating health before the election then many wouldn't have voted for her. She was sending sedition and defamation like some happy birthday cards to anyone and everyone who where raising these issues. 

Because of the PMK and 4th coalition party of DMDK, Thol, etc the votes that should have gone to DMK were divided to these useless parties that won none but were considerable enough to put dent into DMK party. Almost 15 were won by AIADMK hardly with 1000-2000 votes and the 4th coalition were having more number of votes with them.

She was behaving as if she is bigger than the party and the TN also. She was stupid to think she was invincible. She was good administrator but in her last couple of years she was not able to function and the shit show was run by Sasikala. 
Now Modi got ball-less nuts of both OPS and EPS and AIADMK knows that this is the final time they will be seeing the politics. ",2018-04-11 00:25:21

**Air India employees protest against airline’s privatisation**

**Mumbai:** A group of Air India employees on Tuesday held a lunch-hour meeting at the airline’s Kalina office to protest against the sale of the carrier to private players. 

During the half-an-hour protest meet, the union—joint forum for Air India
unions against privatisation—functionaries made the staffers aware of the
“perils” of privatisation and its consequential impact on the employees jobs,
one of the member of the forum said.

This was the first action by the forum following the civil aviation ministry
seeking expression of interest (EoI) from potential bidders for a 76% stake
sale in the loss-making carrier as well as divestment of two of its
subsidiaries.

“Nine trade unions participated in our protest meeting during the lunch hour.
The privatisation is in no way going to safeguard the employees interest. And
for this reason we are totally opposed to it,” the member said. “With such
meetings, the various unions are trying to create an awareness among the
employees about the impending job losses,” he added.

Air Corporation Employees Union, All India Service Engineers’ Association, Air
India Employees Union, Aviation Industry Employee Guild, Air India Aircraft
Engineers’ Association, All India Aircraft Engineers’ Association, Air India
Engineers Association and United Air India Officers Association and Aviation
Industry Employees Guild are the part of the forum.

Together, these unions represent over than 10,000 Air India employees. The
civil aviation ministry has sought EoIs from potential bidders for a 76% stake
sale in loss-making Air India as well as divestment of Air India Express and
AI-SATS.

On 28 March, the ministry came out with the preliminary information memorandum
on Air India’s strategic disinvestment. As per the memorandum, the government
plans to offload 76% equity share capital of the national carrier as well as
transfer the management control.

The proposed transaction would involve Air India, its low-cost arm Air India
Express and Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt Ltd, which is an equal joint
venture between the national airline and Singapore-based SATS Ltd.

Eight of these unions had earlier also in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra
Modi flagged the possibility of retrenchment of workforce in case of
privatisation, citing job losses in the aftermath of the previous NDA
government’s decision to sell two Centaur Hotels properties in Mumbai.

“The private lobby is talking about Rs30,000 crore bailout package to Air
India for over 10-year period as a waste of tax payers money and has sought
its privatisation. But the same people are keeping quite on the default of
over Rs8 lakh crore of government-owned banks by the private
corporate/companies only,” the member alleged.

The debt-ridden national carrier is staying afloat on little over Rs30,000
crore bailout package extended by the previous UPA regime. “Moreover, the
government is selling the airline at a time when its making operating profit
and is on the way to financial and operational improvement. That way, is it
not trying to socialise the losses and privatise the profit?,” the member
asked.

Air India has been “consistently improving” its overall performance and more
than doubled its operating profit to Rs298.03 crore in 2016-17 financial year,
junior minister for civil aviation Jayant Sinha had informed Parliament
earlier this year.

**Worried by data leak, PM wants servers in India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi is understood to have expressed serious concern
over data leaks and alleged manipulation of user information by global
internet and social media giants. According to top sources, the PM has
instructed that data sharing should be regulated and servers be located within
the country.

The issue came up for discussion during a recent meeting of the Union Cabinet,
where the episode of data leakage and manipulation by Facebook and UK-based
Cambridge Analytica was raised, said sources. ""The PM said that servers that
house data of millions of users should be located within India. The issue was
thereafter discussed within the IT ministry which carried out a thorough
review last week,"" a top source told TOI .

The majority of user data generated on platforms of top companies such as
Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram is stored across servers located
internationally. Moreover, access to these servers - and the information they
hold - is highly regulated by US laws and certain international treaties.

Questions sent to Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram - regarding their
plans for having local servers - and also on steps initiated towards data
security, remained unanswered. The sources said the issue is being pursued on
""top priority"" by the government. ""The PM has said that instruments should be
established to ensure that user information is increasingly stored locally,
and that its sharing is regulated. Data protection is of utmost concern in a
highly-digital society... ""

A key concern of the IT ministry is that user data does not get misused for
any kind of manipulation, including for 'managing' electoral processes in
India. ""An inquiry is already on regarding the Facebook and Cambridge
Analytica episode where data may have been manipulated during polls. The
government also wants to look into the other aspects related to data
protection,"" said sources.

The PM's call for local servers comes days after banking regulator RBI
mandated that all payment system operators have to store data within the
country by September. RBI's move will also impact Google and WhatsApp as they
have entered the domestic digital payments sector.

Facebook has already said that it is taking steps to ensure user privacy and
guard against manipulation by third-party vendors. While Google has three data
servers in Mumbai, they are only for enterprise/business customers. Data
generated by millions of consumers is not stored locally.

**CAG points out corruption in Delhi, Kejriwal government calls for CBI probe** 

 ______ 
The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has flagged a slew of irregularities
in the financial administration of the national capital, prompting the Delhi
government to say on Tuesday that a federal investigation will be sought in at
least 50 instances of government resources being swindled.

Some of the important findings of the CAG, tabled by deputy chief minister
Manish Sisodia in the Assembly on Tuesday, included untracked funds amounting
to Rs 7,270 crore and instances where ration shop owners cornered subsidised
grains meant for the poor.

“No one will be spared,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, promising
“exemplary action”. The government said it would send at least 50 cases
pointed out by the CAG to the Union government for an investigation by the
Central Bureau of Investigation.

In addition to financial irregularities, the CAG also highlighted cases of
administrative oversight and inaction that resulted in delayed projects and
inefficient operations.

According to the report, the government till March 31 last year failed to
collect 3,105 utilisation certificates for Rs 7,269.69 crore released in
grants. Of the total amount, 64% (amounting to Rs 4,939 crore) was outstanding
for two to 10 years.

The auditor found corruption in the government’s public distribution system
where it said that 792 ration shop licence-holders were enjoying subsidised
foodgrains that could have otherwise been given to the poor. Delhi’s quota of
ration card holders has been full and no new beneficiaries are being added.

**Read: In the season of bank frauds, NDA govt’s anti-corruption crusade goes into overdrive**

Kejriwal said his government was trying to control the “ration mafia” and
blamed the Lieutenant Governor for stalling a scheme to start doorstep
delivery of subsidised foodgrain. Last month, the L-G returned the file asking
the government to re-work the scheme and consider cash transfer of subsidies.

“The entire ration system is in the grip of mafia protected by political
masters. Doorstep delivery would have destroyed this mafia,” the CM said. The
L-G’s office did not respond to requests for a comment.

Opposition leader Vijender Gupta criticised the government and said it was not
serious about its budget estimates and expenditures.“All excess expenditures
made by the government are going unaccounted as the Kejriwal government has
been unable to hold even a single meeting of the Public Accounts Committee,”
he said.

**Amit Shah Heckled By Dalit Protestors In Mysuru. What's At Stake For BJP** 

 ______ 
**Bengaluru, Karnataka: **

Just a half-hour drive from Bengaluru's IT hub of Electronic City, lies the
town of Anekal - largely undistinguished and of no note to outsiders but known
locally for its history of violence against Christians and its oppression of
Dalits, who form nearly 30 percent of the population, but are divided between
the ""right hand touchables"" or Chalavadis, who are traditionally Congress
supporters, while the Madigas or the ""Left Hand untouchables"" have been
associated with the BJP for the last decade.

What has united them - and nearly 100 other sub-castes of Dalits - is last
month's Supreme Court verdict on what is referred to as the SC/ST Act. Judges
say their decision did not dilute the law, but ensures that its provisions do
not violate individual rights - so, for example, arrests can no longer be made
as soon as a Dalit files a police complaint of discrimination.

""Dalits are seeing this as an injustice, which had the tacit approval of the
BJP government at the Centre"", said M Prakash, a school teacher in Anekal who
is an activist of a Dalit rights organisation.

Dalit groups protest against the Supreme Court order in Bengaluru

Dalits believe that the SC/ST Act is sacrosanct because it is a powerful
instrument in fighting caste humiliation and is as important for them as
reservation as a tool of empowerment and upward mobility. The fear that these
rights, safeguarded by the constitution, are under threat is fast gaining
currency on the ground despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Dalit outreach
which includes frequent ceremonies and monuments commemorating Dalit icon Dr B
R Ambedkar, ensuring the election of Dalit politician Ram Nath Kovind as
President of the country, and ordering MPs to spend nights in Dalit homes in
their constituencies.

Dalits, according to a leaked census which was conducted by the incumbent
Congress government but never formally shared, form 19% percent of Karnataka's
population. They influence the results of nearly 60 of the 224 seats that will
be decided when the state votes on May 12.

A countrywide

_bandh_

or protest on April 2 saw gigantic participation and left nine people dead.
The centre then asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its verdict; judges
refused to suspend the controversial ruling, but have agreed to hear the
centre's case later this month.

_Bharat Bandh_ called by Dalit groups last week saw widespread violence across
five states and cost nearly a dozen lives

Four Dalit MPs from the BJP have insinuated that its response was neither
strong nor fast enough, while also massaging the point that in appealing
against the Supreme Court's verdict, their party acted counter-intuitively and
not without some reluctance.

This is also the impression in Anekal, where Dalits live in separate colonies
and are discouraged from entering temples in areas dominated by upper castes.
""The order has been welcomed by the upper castes who form the BJP's core
constituency. It will help the party to further consolidate their vote before
the elections,"" alleged R Shankar, a local Dalit activist.

The BJP has for decades been the homestead of upper caste Hindus; its opulent
victory in the last general election was facilitated by Amit Shah, the party
chief, managing to weave together traditional supporters with an assortment of
lower and backward castes including Dalits in states like Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar.

PM Modi at the BJP's _Parivartana_ rally in Bengaluru with the party's chief
ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa

In Karnataka, the BJP has been the preference of Lingayats and other upper
castes; even in 2014, when the triumphant 'Modi wave' fanned across India, the
Dalits remained unpersuaded. Of Karnataka's 28 parliamentary seats, four are
reserved for Dalit candidates; the BJP won just one of those.

The PM has tried to persuade Dalits, who together with tribals form a quarter
of the country's population, that Hindutva ideology is not hostile to their
progress, but in 2016, nearly 41,000 cases of atrocities against Dalits were
registered across India. 60% of those cases were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, all states ruled by the BJP. ""In Karnataka,
crimes against Dalits have also shown an increase in the five years of
Congress rule, so they cannot claim the moral high ground,"" former BJP chief
minister Jagadish Shettar told NDTV.

But if the Dalits in the state do desert the BJP completely, the buck will
have to stop with his colleague, Anant Kumar Hegde, the MP from Uttara Kannada
constituency. At a public function in December , Mr Hegde, a union minister,
said ""The Constitution needs to be changed from time to time and we have come
for that"", which was seen as a remark on doing away with reservation or
guaranteed government jobs and college places for scheduled castes. To make
matters worse, Mr Hegde, a Brahmin, then referred to the protests staged by a
group of Dalits against his statement as ""the barking of stray dogs"". The BJP
argued that Mr Hegde's views were personal and not those of the party and
thought it was a closed chapter.

BSP chief Mayawati is less enthusiastic about her tie up with JDS now than she
was a month ago

Then, a fortnight ago, a meeting between Amit Shah and a group of Dalit
leaders in Mysuru was marred by protests against the BJP bosses for failing to
act against the minister. ""The PM says that 'No government has given respect
to Babasaheb the way our government has.' If this is true, then why doesn't he
sack Mr Hegde? This can only mean that privately, the BJP's and its minister's
views are the same,"" insists a Dalit activist who was one of the protestors at
Amit Shah's meeting. ""Since December, we have been warning our people to be
vigilant, because even the poorest Dalit knows that his right to reservation
is enshrined in the constitution and anyone who wants to rewrite it wants to
snatch this right away from us."" The derision that Amit Shah confronted was in
Mysuru, the heart of South Karnataka, where the BJP won no seat at all in the
last state election. It is crucial for the party to build support here.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of the Congress belongs to a shepherd community.
He is backed by a cohort of Dalits, other backward castes, and minorities. He
believes that crucial schemes that he introduced including give free grains to
the poorest families, free milk for students up till Class 10, and interest-
free loans for farmers have broadened his support to include economically
backward sections of the upper caste Lingayats and Vokkaligas. He has also
introduced Indira canteens serving subsidised food which are copied from the
famous

_Amma_

canteens in Tamil Nadu.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will have to work hard to keep the fragmented
Dalit vote together

The BJP is hoping that the Dalit vote in Karnataka will be split by the big
play made by Mayawati, the Dalit leader from Uttar Pradesh, who has partnered
with Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal (S) in an arrangement which allows her own
party to compete for 20 seats, though she did not win any in the last state
election in 2013.

But her workers say that her collaboration with Deve Gowda, seen as close to
the BJP, lacks conviction. ""She has not given us any clear-cut order to vote
for Deve Gowda's candidates,"" claimed a BSP worker in Anekal. ""Besides, JD(S)
is a feudal party, supported by the dominant Vokkaliga caste which has always
victimised Dalits.""

__ Comments

As for the Congress, if it wants to win the Scheduled Caste vote in Karnataka,
it will have to do more than ride the wave of Dalit anger erupting across the
country and consolidate a significant section of the many sub-castes. Though
the ""left hand Dalits"" are numerically stronger, the majority of the Congress
leadership in the state including Mallikarjun Kharge and G Parameshwara,
President of the Karnataka Congress, come from the ""right hand Dalits"" who
have long been accused of helping their sub-caste to corner the larger share
of government benefits.

Tempering that sentiment is no less a challenge than what the BJP is
encountering.

**Modi’s fast diversionary tactic, he is responsible for Parliament washout: Naidu** 

 ______ 
Telugu Desam Party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu
Naidu on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of diverting people’s
attention from his inability to resolve contentious issues with a day-long
fast on April 12.

“This is ridiculous and an attempt to run away from the crucial issues raised
by the Opposition parties in the just-concluded Parliament session,” Naidu,
the BJP’s friend-turned-foe said in a chat with media persons on the sidelines
of a dinner hosted for delegates attending the three-day Happy Cities Summit
that began in Amaravati.

The Prime Minister will fast in New Delhi on April 12 to protest against the
disruption of Parliamentary proceedings by opposition parties. Bharatiya
Janata Party president Amit Shah will sit on fast in Karnataka while party MPs
will do so across the country.

“Who is responsible for the logjam in Parliament? Was it not the NDA
government which was behind the AIADMK MPs, who stalled the proceeding of Lok
Sabha, to avoid facing the no-confidence motion proposed by the Opposition?”
Naidu asked.

He felt if the Centre really wanted, it could have constituted the Cauvery
Board as demanded by the AIADMK. “The Supreme Court ordered that the Cauvery
Board be constituted and the Centre could have done to do it to resolve the
decades-long dispute (between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). Who stopped Modi from
doing it?” he said.

The chief minister said it was wrong on the part of the Prime Minister to
blame it on the Opposition for the Parliament logjam. “Our MPs thoroughly
exposed the deceit of the NDA government in not fulfilling the promises made
in AP Reorganisation Act, including granting of special category status to
AP,” he said.

The TDP pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in March over the
Centre’s refusal to grant special category status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh
after 14th Finance Commission removed the SCS concept.

Reiterating his government’s commitment to continue the developmental
programmes in the state with or without the central government’s assistance,
Naidu said the Centre had granted a pittance to the state for the construction
of Amaravati, the new capital city of the state.

“The farmers had voluntarily surrendered 34,000 acres of their land worth over
Rs 55,000 crore for building the capital. But the Centre had given just Rs
1,500 crore,” he said.

Naidu said the state was going ahead with the construction of the capital
involving private sector without waiting for the Central assistance. “If the
Centre extends help, we will welcome it. Even otherwise, we would go ahead
with the works with people’s cooperation. Several NRIs are coming forward to
contribute their might for creating a world-class capital city,” he added.

Asked why the Centre had not come forward to help Andhra Pradesh overcome the
bifurcation blues, the chief minister said the BJP, perhaps, thought of
gaining political mileage by weakening the state and forcing the TDP
government to surrender before it for funds.

“They wanted to gain control over the state by weakening the allies. But the
TDP is a very strong party. That is why they have started looking for weak
allies. They are joining hands with a party which is tainted with corruption
and targeting us,” he alleged.

But Naidu did not name any party.

23,"Give him a free hand. Don't interfere with his methods if you want fast results. India is plagued by democracy and too much bureaucracy. We need a strong leader who quickly transforms us, even if there is some pain for some people. You gave the Congress 60 years, give him 60 months! People did not support Modi in Demonetisation and GST. If people had supported, India would be like China today. Imagine if everyone paid tax properly. Main topic today is industrial growth. All these other things like minority, human rights, women freedom are there, but not a bit as important and industrial growth. Otherwise how will we ever become superpower like USA and China. Chinese govt controls the people really strictly. That's what we need. And Modi can deliver growth like China. See how Gujarat has flourishing businesses, roads, highways, airports and even the bullet train now. It's just superb how Modi can transform a state inside a decade. If every CM were like Modi India would go past China within 5 years. We are idiots without vision, because we don't support Modi. Look at his personality and look at his achievements. He is truly making India global - see how he is giving so much importance to foreign policy. He has viisted all important nations. Without exports, how will our citizens become rich? How will our businesses flourish. Today even Flipkart is not a global brand. We want to become so advanced that Flipkart and others should become like Amazon and Google. That's where Modi can take us. And these fools talk about human rights and women's rights. It's all a distraction by stupid brainwashed communists to stop Modi from making us a great economy. Fucking anti-national betrayers. They should be sent to Pakistan in trains just like in Partition times. We don't want them here - Hindus also. What use is it if they cant take the one real chance India has in its entire history for true greatness. We have had enough weak leaders and traitors like Gandhi, Nehru and Indira and MMS. Now we have a chance at world domination like USA. If Modi goes, I don't think we will have another chance. Such a person comes once in a century. Last century it was Sardar Patel. This century it is Modi. You will regret if you don't vote for BJP. You Pakistani.

**First India-Nordic summit to boost ties with 5 nations** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

will meet leaders of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark &amp;amp; Iceland for the
first

India-Nordic Summit

in Stockholm on April 17.

Modi will be the first Indian PM to visit Stockholm since 1988. The only other
instance of a similar

Nordic summit

was during President Barack Obama’s tenure when heads of state or governments
participated.

Swedish Ambassador to India

Klas Molin

told ET “Prime Minister Löfven was very happy to accept the proposal by PM
Modi to hold an Indo-Nordic Summit in Stockholm. The two PMs have met and
spoken often over the last few years and they have very good chemistry. They
jointly invited the other Nordic prime ministers to Stockholm for the summit.

The six leaders will exchange views on regional and global issues such as
environment and climate, trade and investment and discuss areas of future
cooperation,”. Löfven’s office in a statement said “the government is working
to strengthen Sweden’s role as a key partner for India in the country’s rapid
development, especially in innovation.”

Norwegian ambassador Nils Ragnar Kamsvag told ET “the India-Nordic Summit
symbolises shared democraticvalues between the two sides.

This exercise will reflect upon the importance of rule of law in the
international order besides attempting to harness the

bilateral economic potential

.

At the same time… the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund is probably one of the
biggest single investors in India, having invested over $11.7 billion in India
at the end of 2017 in 275 different Indian companies and in Indian bonds.The
size of the investment is a testimony to the economic potential Norway sees in
India.”

Modi will meet the Indian diaspora at the end of the visit. There are 25,000
living in Sweden, with industries like tech in particular attracting skilled
labour. Over 170 Swedish companies have invested $1.4 billion since 2000.
Around 70 Indian companies have invested in Sweden. India-Sweden annual
bilateral trade stands at around $1.8 billion, according to MEA statement.
India-Nordic trade $ 5.3 billion in 2016-17, with Cumulative FDI to India at $
2.5 billion.

**Once his best friend, oil now looks menacingly at Narendra Modi** 

 ______ 
**by Debjit Chakraborty and Annmarie Hordern**

Oil’s rally to $70 a barrel is threatening to clip India’s economic wings at a
time when

Saudi Arabia

is looking to join a $30 billion refinery project in the world’s fastest
growing market.

The South Asian nation wants to see prices at about $50 a barrel in order to
manage its finances better, Oil Minister

Dharmendra Pradhan

said in an interview. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia -- which is said to be aiming
for oil near $80 to pay for its own crowded policy agenda -- is planning to
sign a deal to participate in a refinery on India’s west coast as part of its
strategy to secure sources of consumption for its crude.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration reaped the benefits of the
biggest price crash in a generation during its first term in power, oil is
recovering as the government gears up for elections in 2019. Saudi Arabia, the
world’s biggest crude exporter, is preparing for an initial public offering of
its state-run producer and leading efforts by OPEC to curb output and
eliminate a global glut that spurred oil’s decline.

“We are a very price-sensitive consumer,"" Pradhan said on Tuesday. ""From
Indian consumers’ point of view, I will be more than happy if the price is
around $50 a barrel."" Saudi Arabian Oil, known as Saudi Aramco, has agreed in
principle to join a proposed 1.2 million barrel a day refiner on India’s west
coast, he added.

Saudi Aramco’s Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser will sign a memorandum of
understanding on Wednesday for the project with RRPC, or Ratnagiri Refinery
&amp;amp; Petrochemicals, a consortium consisting of state-run refiners Indian
Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, said a person familiar with the
matter who asked not to be identified before an official announcement.

Aramco may take a 50 percent equity stake in the project and can bring in
another strategic investor, the person said. Nobody immediately replied to an
email seeking comment sent to Aramco’s press office outside regular business
hours.

“Things are on the table, we are discussing with each other,” Pradhan said,
referring to Saudi Arabian participation in the project. “It has to be a win-
win situation for both. It must be acceptable to them, it must be profitable
for me also.’’ He confirmed on Wednesday that a preliminary deal will be
signed with Aramco.

Saudi Arabia has been edged out as the top oil supplier to

India

amid an intensifying race among producers to retain their most-prized markets.
India, which imports about 80 percent of its crude requirements, has been
diversifying its sources of oil supply and is seeking more favorable terms
from producers in the Middle East.

The potential partnership in India would be an extension of Aramco’s strategy
to lock up market share by investing in refineries in Asia, the region that’s
driving global oil demand growth. Over the last few years, the Middle East
kingdom has committed billions to projects in Malaysia and Indonesia, as well
as a new refining and petrochemical plant in China.

Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih is scheduled to speak at the
16th International Energy Forum in New Delhi this week, along with other
Middle Eastern countries’ ministers.

**Maharashtra Farmer Drinks Poison, Names PM Modi In Suicide Note** 

 ______ 
The farmer first tried to hang himself but the rope snapped; he then drank
poison (Representational)

**Yavatmal, Maharashtra: **

A 50-year-old debt-ridden farmer in Maharashtra's Yavatmal district committed
suicide by drinking poison on Tuesday, blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi
and the ruling NDA government in his suicide note.

Shankar Bhaurao Chayre, from Rajurwadi village in Yavatmal district, among the
worst-hit in the country due to the agrarian distress, also sought help for
his family in the suicide note.

Nearly 12 hours after the incident, the family refused to take over his body
from the Vasantrao Naik Medical College Hospital morgue for last rites.

The family demanded that either PM Modi should visit them to understand their
problems or the state government should hand over full compensation before
they would accept the body.

Stunned by the development, Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission (SNSSM)
President Kishore Tiwari announced he will visit the farmer's family on
Wednesday morning.

""We shall provide an immediate relief of Rs 100,000 to the family. Chayre
leaves behind his wife, their three daughters (including one married) and a
son. We have decided to adopt them by providing them full education, or if
they are already qualified, with gainful employment to help the family
survive,"" Mr Tiwari told IANS.

According to information available, the distraught Chayre went to his farmland
on Tuesday morning and attempted to hang himself from a tree.

However, the rope snapped, so he consumed poison and fell unconscious, even as
some workers rushed him to a local hospital in a serious condition.

The medical officials there informed that the case was critical and advised
them to seek help from Yavatmal town. He was taken to a hospital there but
doctors declared him dead.

In a crumpled two-page handwritten suicide note recovered by police, Chayre
narrated how he had sought help from various officials in the government,
including MPs, MLAs, state ministers and others but was ignored.

He narrated that he had a nine-acre farm on which he had planted cotton, for
which he availed a loan of Rs 90,000 from a local cooperative society and Rs
300,000 from a private party.

However, due to the bollworm infection on cotton crops in many parts of
Vidarbha, his crop was destroyed and he experienced extreme crises in repaying
his loans.

""I have a large debt burden, So I am committing suicide. The Narendra Modi
government is responsible,"" he said in his suicide note.

__ Comments

VNSSM's Tiwari said that owing to the completely casual approach of the
government and the public sector banks, the farm loan waiver scheme announced
in June 2017 has yet to reach a vast majority of the beneficiaries.

Besides, other interim aid measures announced in December have also yet to
reach the poor farmers, ""creating a crisis of mega-proportions in the
Maharashtra farmlands"".

**Debt-ridden farmer commits suicide in Maharashtra, blames Modi govt in note** 

 ______ 
A 55-year-old farmer allegedly committed suicide on Tuesday in Maharashtra’s
Yavatmal district of Vidarbha allegedly over mounting debts and failed crop
and blamed the Narendra Modi government for his plight, officials said on
Wednesday.

“I am committing suicide due to the loan burden and Narendra Modi government
is responsible for my suicide,” Shankar Bhaurao Chawre of Rajurwadi village in
Ghatanji tehsil of Yavatmal said in his six-page note.

Chawre also asked Union minister Hansraj Ahir, Maharashtra chief minister
Devendra Fadnavis and Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Raju Todsam and others to
help his family.

Yavatmal superintendent of police Raj Kumar said a purported suicide note was
recovered.

“It mentions the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and holds him
responsible (for the suicide), but we are yet to verify its authenticity and
the actual cause of the death,” Kumar told PTI.

He said the post-mortem report was awaited and that the authenticity of the
purported suicide note would be verified after the autopsy document is ready.

Chawre owned nine acres of barren land and owed Rs 1.40 lakh to the banks and
private money lenders. He was frustrated due to the red bollworm attack on his
cotton crop and the liabilities arising out of his children’s educational
expenses and family obligations.

He had earlier attempted suicide by hanging from a tree on his farm in the
morning but failed after the rope with which he had tied himself snapped. He
then consumed pesticide and collapsed. He was rushed to the local government
medical college and hospital in a critical condition but died in the hospital
at 1.30pm on Tuesday.

Chawre, who belonged to the Gowari community, is survived by wife Alka (47),
school and college going children – daughters Jayashree (19), Bhagyashree
(18), Dhanshree (17) and son Akash (14).

His wife and children have said they will not claim his body and perform his
last rites unless a criminal offence is registered against Prime Minister
Modi. They have also demanded a Rs 1 crore as compensation from the
government.

Kishore Tiwari, the chairperson of the state agriculture mission, expressed
grief over Chawre’s suicide and assured all the possible financial support to
his family.

“We will ensure that the family gets an adequate compensation and his children
get a good education,” Tiwari said.

Tiwari, who is scheduled to visit Rajurwadi village on Wednesday to meet the
bereaved family, alleged that some politicians are trying to take a mileage
from the tragedy.

“They (political rivals) are also misleading the family members,” he added.

Hundreds of farmers have committed suicide in Vidarbha, continuing the more
than a decade-long trend of despair and distress in the face of agrarian
uncertainties.

There could be several reasons behind the suicides but the pink bollworm
attack, which has destroyed standing cotton crop across nearly 15 lakh
hectares in the region, is the latest trigger in the vicious cycle, experts
and officials have said.

Another farmer, Vishal Namdev Pawar of Ner, also committed suicide, leaving
behind a suicide note addressed to then district guardian minister Sanjay
Rathod.

Debt-ridden farmer Prakash Mangaonkar killed himself in Titvi village of
Ghatanji tehsil in the district and left a note on the leaves of a plant
alleging that he had taken the extreme decision as the BJP governments at the
Centre and in the state failed to fulfil assurances given to the farmers.

The government told Parliament in March that India’s high suicide rate among
farmers — a national problem attributed to agrarian distress and debt traps —
fell 10% in 2016.

The number of farmers who committed suicide in 2016 was 11,370, compared to
12,602 the previous year. According to the 2011 census, the suicide rate among
farmers is 47% higher than the national average.

Maharashtra accounted for the highest number of farmer suicides in 2016, at
3,661. This was a fall from 4,291 in 2015.

**Saudi Aramco partners Indian Oil, others to set up world’s largest refinery in Ratnagiri**

**New Delhi:** The world’s biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, will partner with a consortium of Indian state-run companies to set up the largest global refinery and petrochemical complex at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra at an investment of $44 billion.

Saudi Aramco will also enter fuel retailing in India, where energy demand is
expected to grow at 4.2% over the next 25 years.

The equal joint venture between the Indian firms and Saudi Aramco will process
1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day and 18 mtpa of petrochemical
products. The Indian consortium comprises of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and will hold
a 50% equity stake in the joint venture. Of this, the Indian Oil’s share will
be half, with the rest equally shared by HPCL and BPCL.

The kingdom is fully committed to provide for the principles of energy access,
sustainability and security as articulated by India, said Saudi Arabia’s
energy minister Khalid Al-Falih at the signing of a memorandum of
understanding for the 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) Ratnagiri Refinery
&amp;amp; Petrochemcials Ltd (RRPCL).

Apart from investing in the project, Saudi Aramco will also supply crude oil
to the project, ensuring supply security. This assumes significance given
India’s energy needs are primarily met through imports, with the country
importing 214 million tonnes of crude oil in 2016-17. In future, Saudi Aramco
may also induct a strategic partner by divesting its 50% equity stake in the
project.

Assurance and (energy) security will only increase with this investment, added
Khalid Al-Falih who is in India to attend the 16th International Energy Forum
Ministerial (IEF—16) inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.

Saudi Aramco’s India play has been in the works for some time now and follows
Modi’s visit to the Gulf kingdom in 2016. It marks a reset in the changing
global energy architecture, with buyers at the centre of oil majors’ future
growth plans. India is the world’s third-largest energy consumer after the US
and China.

“We see India as a priority destination for our investments,” said Khalid Al-
Falih.

The Indian government is seeking Saudi Arabia’s participation in grassroots
refinery projects coming up in the country, _Mint_ had reported on 3 May 2007.

India’s petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the relationship between
India and Saudi Arabia has progressed from the level of a buyer and seller to
that of a “strategic partnership”.

The development also assumes significance in the backdrop of a supply cut by
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)—of which Saudi
Arabia is a prominent member—and Russia triggering a rally in global crude oil
price. This has resulted in the cost of Indian basket of crude, which averaged
$47.56 a barrel in 2016-17, touching $63.80 (average price) in March 2018,
according to information from Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. Extreme
volatility has marked crude oil prices, which had touched a record $147 per
barrel in July 2009.

The Indian basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.

“The strategic partnership brings together crude supply, resources,
technologies, experience and expertise of these multiple oil companies with an
established commercial presence around the world,” the Indian government said
in a statement.

**PM Modi to fast tomorrow: BJP leaders to lead protests across India; here’s all you need to know**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will observe a day-long fast on Thursady in New
Delhi (File)

After Congress’ nationwide fast earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra
Modi will observe a day-long fast in New Delhi on Thursday. Top BJP leaders,
meanwhile, will fan out to different parts of the country to lead the protest
against the washout of Parliament proceedings. While BJP chief Amit Shah will
fast in poll-bound Karnataka, Union Health Minister J P Nadda will lead the
charge in PM Modi’s constituency Varanasi.

**Here is all you need to know about PM Modi’s fast tomorrow**

**Why is PM Modi fasting?**

Accusing the Congress of taking parliamentary proceedings “to a new low” with
its conduct, PM Modi announced the fast to protest the impasse “caused” by the
opposition party in Parliament, which saw a washout of the second half of the
Budget Session. Addressing BJP MPs on the party’s foundation day, PM Modi
directed all party units across the nation to observe the fast.

Addressing party MPs through an audio conference call ahead of the protest,
Modi said the BJP leaders and its workers will observe the fast tomorrow to
“expose” those handfuls of people who “throttled” democracy by stalling
Parliament proceedings.

“The people who couldn’t gain power in 2014, don’t want the country to move
forward. They didn’t let Parliament work for a single day. They killed
democracy &amp;amp; we will observe fast to bring their crime in front of world. I
will also hold fast. But I will continue my work.” said Modi.

**Who all are participating in the fast?**

The Prime Minister has directed all the party lawmakers to observe fast in
their respective constituencies. While PM Modi will lead the party from New
Delhi, Amit Shah will hold a sit-in at Hubli in poll-bound Karnataka. Home
Minister Rajnath Singh, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Commerce
Minister Suresh Prabhu will accompany PM Modi in the national capital. Union
Health Minister J P Nadda will be in Modi’s constituency Varanasi, while Law
Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will travel to Patna for the fast.

Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will observe the fast in Chennai, Human
Resource Development Minister Prakash Javdekar in Bengaluru, Minister of State
for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel in Tamil Nadu and Minister of State for
External Affairs MJ Akbar in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh. Tourism Minister KJ
Alphons will observe the fast in Kerala. However, the prime minister will not
disturb his routine of meeting people and officials and clearing files during
the fast reported PTI.

BJP MPs on April 12

**Photo-op says Congress; Naidu, Owaisi question PM Modi**

Taking a swipe against PM Modi’s proposed fast, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi
cited the Unnao rape incident and said he hoped that the prime minister would
observe a fast “over atrocities against women, failed law and order and
increasing anarchy under the BJP’s watch.” Calling it a “drama” and “photo-
op,” Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala blamed the BJP for
Parliament washout. “Prime Minister ji, it is not the time to observe fast, in
view of your failures… it is time to take retirement instead. If you do not
wake up now, you should understand that the time of your retirement will come
in 2019 when people will vote you out,” he added.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who recently snapped ties
with NDA over special status to the state, questioned PM Modi fasting against
Parliament impasse, alleging it was the Centre which ensured the disruption by
provoking AIADMK over the Cauvery issue. “They provoked the AIADMK and
ensured” that the MPs of the ruling party in Tamil Nadu stormed the well of
the Lok Sabha and thereby did not allow TDP to raise its demand (for grant of
special category status to Andhra Pradesh). How atrocious? And now he (Prime
Minister) says he will observe protest…seeking to portray the opposition as
wrong and he is right. Is it correct? Is it justified,” he questioned.

MIM party chief Asaduddin Owaisi took a jibe against PM Modi and wondered if
he would undertake a fast on the farmers’ suicides issue and also to atone for
“false” promises made by him. “If the Prime Minister wants to fast for losing
the whole session of parliament, I want to ask the honourable prime minister
where is his sense of duty lost, wherein, in the past four years thousands of
farmers committed suicides. Will the Prime Minister fast for those farmers?
Will he sit on fast against the atrocities against Dalits in Uttar Pradesh?
Why does not the Prime minister sit on fast to atone for his false promises?,”
the Hyderabad Lok Sabha MP questioned.

acts of communal violence across the country. (Express photo)

**What happened during Congress’ fast?**

The Congress observed a nationwide fast on April 9 to protest atrocities
against Dalits and acts of communal violence across the country. However, the
image of its leaders eating chole bhature before the fast went viral resulting
in deep embarrassment for the party. “Wow our Congress leaders, they invited
people to join the hunger strike, but they themselves are relishing chhole
bhature at a restaurant … clearly befooling (people),” BJP leader Harish
Khurana tweeted with the image of Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken having food
along with Amrinder Singh Lovely at a food joint.

Calling it a “farce of a fast”, the BJP mocked the opposition party, saying
its leaders claim of bringing a change but cannot abstain from one meal and
their president Rahul Gandhi cannot wake up in morning even for a day as they
are used to “politics of luxury”. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also took a
dig at Rahul Gandhi for turning up at Rajghat at 1 pm while the fast had
started at 10.30 am, saying it shows that the Congress chief cannot wake up in
the morning as he and his colleagues were used to “politics of luxury”. He
contrasted it with the “politics of performance” of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi who, he noted, comes from a common family belonging to backward caste and
has worked to bring Dalits in mainstream socially and economically.

When asked about the picture that surfaced on social media, Lovely explained:
“The fast was scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM and we were busy with preparation
till late night yesterday. We went for breakfast at around 8 AM. So, there is
nothing wrong in it.”

During the fast, Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being
“casteist” and “anti-Dalit”. He added that his party will always stand against
the BJP’s “oppressive” ideology. The Congress president sat for several hours
at Rajghat and was joined by senior leaders, including Kamal Nath, Mallikarjun
Kharge, Sheila Dikshit, Ashok Gehlot, Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken and the
party’s communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala.

**Ahead of CHOGM meet in London, India, Pakistan walk tightrope on Russia**

Updated: April 12, 2018 7:28:43 am

In its efforts to dilute any reference to Russia, India has found an unlikely
partner in Pakistan, which is developing its own ties with Moscow in recent
years, much to Delhi’s discomfiture.

As the United Kingdom and Russia are engaged in a diplomatic face-off over the
Salisbury incident, India and Pakistan are caught in a dilemma on how to
negotiate their way through the joint declaration at the upcoming Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London next week. Prime Minister
Narendra Modi will be in London from April 18, and will attend the summit on
April 19-20.

Sources said the UK is keen to include a strongly-worded paragraph on the
Salisbury incident. However, India, which has strong strategic ties with
Russia, wants the language to be moderated, and would not even want a
reference to the incident in the declaration.

In its efforts to dilute any reference to Russia, India has found an unlikely
partner in Pakistan, which is developing its own ties with Moscow in recent
years, much to Delhi’s discomfiture.

At the CHOGM summit, the negotiators are also discussing a declaration on
“cyber crime” — which may have a reference to Russian involvement in elections
in the UK and US.

“We do not want to get caught in the battle between the West and the Russians…
while we understand the need to voice our concerns, we will do it, if the need
arises, in a bilateral format, and not on such multilateral groupings,” a
South Block source told The Indian Express.

For India, one of the main reasons for not acting adversely against Russian
interests is the strong defence ties. A possible deal on S-400 missile system
is at risk of attracting sanctions imposed on Russians.

Though the Salisbury incident took place over a month ago, on March 4, India
has refrained from issuing a statement. The only Indian statement on the issue
was at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)’s
special session, where Indian envoy Venu Rajamony said that “India, like all
other countries, should await the outcome of the investigation” done by the
OPCW.

This was a clear riposte to the UK and western countries, as the British
authorities had concluded that the plot to kill former Russian spy Sergei
Skripal and his daughter Yulia, by using a nerve agent, was carried out by
Russia. Yulia has since been discharged from hospital, while Sergei is still
recuperating.

According to sources, the Indian position is going to be on the line that
“India is against the use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by
anybody, under any circumstances”. This formulation was articulated by the
Indian envoy at the OPCW meeting in the Netherlands on April 4. Sources said
Indian negotiators are clear that there will not be any mention of Russian
interference in the CHOGM joint declaration.

“We cannot stop what individual countries may or may not say in their
statements, but we will steer clear of the controversy,” said a source. While
Modi’s speech is still being discussed, it is unlikely to make any mention of
the issue, given his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Western allies have supported Britain, and over 20 countries, including the
US, have expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats. Moscow has denied any
involvement and has accused London of coming up with a “fake story”. Moscow
too has retaliated with expulsions of diplomats from these countries.

70,"Let me get this straight to you. When something big like this happens, the community is affected as a whole. When a hindu does something bad and other hindus support him by chanting Jai Shree Ram, no one will sit down and filter out bad from good. That's why they are communities. Similarly, hindutva is a community of people who follow same religion and practices. For example, when hindu muslim riot breaks out, everyone has to be on alert. Its not like only those who have caused the riot are affected. You saying that no one in South India gives a fuck about yogi or modi, seems like no one in South India gives a fuck about India as a whole country, which makes people think that South India doesn't think of itself as a part of India. So get this in your head, it doesn't matter if you are shitting on street or in a five star hotel toilet, in the minds of foreign people India is a country where people shit on streets, as the action of some people is representing India as a whole.",2018-04-12 08:43:35

P.S. For every other people: I said that KPS Gill was a necessary evil who had to be brought out by the Indian state to rein in the Sikh terrorists of those times. Both were equal in their inhumanity. Does it make KPS a saint because he was on the side of the state? Hell naw. Does it make Sikh terrorists saints victims because they were fighting against the state for 'freedom'? Hell naw. Both sides killed a shitton of civilians. No one emerged as a moral winner. Not a lot sympathise with Sikh extremism. That's why Congress is elected again in Punjab. There are a lot more nuances to this issue other than what /u/Modi-iboM  portrays.  
Now if the above para convinces you that I'm a supporter of state-sponsored terrorism, go ahead with your assumptions. Peace out.",2018-04-12 09:43:24

**In Rajasthan, houses of Dalit MLA, ex-minister set ablaze**

Supreme Court on the SC/ST Act on Monday. (Express Photo/Gurmeet Singh/File)

A day after Dalit protests triggered violence in different parts of the
country, fresh violence broke out in Rajasthan as a mob set ablaze the houses
of a sitting MLA and a former MLA — both Dalits — in Hindaun, in Karauli
district, about 160 km from Jaipur, during counter-protests on Tuesday
morning. Police said the mob also tried to attack a Dalit settlement.

“Yesterday, a crowd of about 15,000-20,000 protesters, who were in favour of
the Bharat Bandh, created a ruckus in several areas like Gangapur in Sawai
Madhopur and Hindaun in Karauli. Today, traders, businessmen and non-Scheduled
Caste people took out a rally against yesterday’s violence,” said Inspector
General of Police, Bharatpur range, Alok Kumar Vashishtha.

“Defying prohibitory orders imposed in the area, they tried to enter a Jatav
settlement. Police had to intervene,” he said. “The mob of 3,000-4,000 people
also attacked the houses of MLA Rajkumari Jatav and former MLA Bharosi Lal
Jatav. The police were outnumbered. The houses were set on fire, several
police personnel were injured,” said Vashishtha.

“The mob wanted to go towards the Jatav settlement but were dispersed by the
police. They, however, targeted the houses of the two politicians,” said
Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, N R K Reddy.

**Read | On Dalits, despite PM Narendra Modi push, BJP plays catch-up**

While Rajkumari Jatav is the local BJP MLA, Bharosi Lal Jatav was a minister
in the previous Congress government in Rajasthan.

“On Monday, a few vehicles owned by our family were torched. Today, my house
was set on fire. The police remained silent spectators. Fortunately, I left
for Delhi in the morning, and my family has gone to Mathura, which is why we
were saved. Miscreants who break the law have no caste,” said Bharosi Lal
Jatav.

IGP Vashishtha said 45 people had been arrested for Tuesday’s violence, while
another 50 were arrested for the protests in Bharatpur on Monday. “Curfew has
been imposed in Hindaun and Internet services have been suspended in the
district. We are identifying the miscreants and some of them have been
detained. Extra police personnel have been deployed, and the situation is
under control,” he said.

According to police, about 1,000 people have been arrested across the state
for the violence on Monday. “We have registered 172 cases so far,” said Reddy.

Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 10 on Tuesday — seven in Madhya Pradesh, two
in Uttar Pradesh and one in Rajasthan. These three states, along with Punjab,
were the worst hit during Monday’s protests against the alleged move to dilute
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

A 35-year-old Sub-Inspector, Mahendra Choudhary, who suffered a heart attack
during the protests in Jodhpur on Monday, also died today.

**Welcome PM Modi, we’ve bulldozed wall for you** 

 ______ 
CHENNAI:

Prime Minister

Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to

Adyar Cancer Institute

to inaugurate few facilities on Thursday has kicked up a controversy, as
authorities are preparing a helipad on the IIT Madras campus for the purpose.
A compound wall shared by the Children’s Park and the cancer institute has
also been demolished. All three campuses are close to the

Guindy National Park

, which is the country’s only reserved forest in the heart of a city.

The wall that divides the Children’s Park and Cancer Institute campus on
Sardar Patel Road was torn down to make parking space for the PM’s convoy in
Children’s Park, facilitating direct entry to the hospital. “We don’t have
adequate parking space on our campus. This is a temporary arrangement. We will
rebuild the wall after the PM’s visit,” said Dr Shanta, chairman of the Adyar
Cancer Institute.

Security personnel conducted mock convoy drills on Tuesday, ahead of Modi’s
proposed visit to the city on April 12, to inaugurate DefExpo–2018 being held
at Thiruvidanthai on East Coast Road (ECR). He will also unveil a day-care
facility, a nursing quarters, a diamond jubilee building at the cancer
institute and a palliative care centre in Sriperumbudur during his visit.

Plans to land a chopper close to the reserve park area has been criticised by
naturalists. Madras Naturalists’ Society member V Santharam said the movement
of helicopter in a small area would traumatise the endangered black buck and
spotted deer population in the vicinity. The institute’s campus has around 30
black bucks including fawns.

In the past too, attempts were made to create a helipad inside the Guindy
National Park campus. However, opposition from activists and media stalled the
initiatives.

Adyar Cancer Institute chairman Dr Shanta wrote to Prime Minister Modi in
January, requesting him to visit the centre to inaugurate four facilities. and
received a positive reply on it last week. “On April 2, they told that the PM
will be visiting Chennai on April 12. They told us we will receive a
confirmation soon. We got that late last night,” said Dr Shanta.

Modi will be at the cancer centre for an hour from 12.50pm. The hospital, she
said, is planning to put his visit to best use. Due to security reasons, Modi
will not be visiting many wards or touring the hospital. “I don’t want to ask
him for anything. I want him to understand the problems of a non-government
voluntary organisation. The idea is to let him ponder over what more the
government can do for an organisation like ours,” she said.

Security arrangements were beefed up, as several political parties and
organisations have announced that they would show black flags to Modi during
the visit. At least 5,000 police personnel have been deployed in and around
the expo venue to ensure security.

Indian Coast Guard

and coastal security group CID officials have also been roped in to monitor
the state’s coast to narrow down the infiltrators through sea.

But since her death, the TN govt is seen as a puppet of the center and its functioning only because of Modi's help. OPS himself accepted this in a recent interview/speech. 

So there is a sense of helplessness amongst the people. And that's why people had to come out in huge numbers for Jallikattu. Because they were sure that the TN govt. would not do anything to make a case for TN against the center. I have not seen this kind of mobilization for protests before Jaya's death. Maybe social media contributed to it as well. But this is being taken advantage by ever protesting groups like Seeman, Vaiko, etc. 

I can only hope that this is an interim phase and would end when the next TN elections happen and a proper govt is elected.

**Big boost to Narendra Modi before 2019 elections: India to grow faster than China; details here**

In a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2019 General Elections
preparations, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) today said India’s two-year
trend of declining growth will reverse in the Financial Year 2018. The Asian
Development Outlook (ADO) 2018 report says Indian economy will expand by 7.3%
in FY 2018. This will be followed by a 7.6% growth in FY 2019.

Declining growth in the last two years had provided the opposition talking
point to take on the Modi government, which came to power in 2014 promising
“achche din”. As per ADB, the growth rate of India will be higher than China
in FY 2018. Not just this, while India’s growth will go up in the next
financial year, China’s growth is predicted to decline.

The report says Chinese economy would expand by 6.6% in FY 2018 and by 6.4% in
2019. “Expansion in China should moderate to 6.6 per cent in 2018 and 6.4 per
cent in 2019 as economic policy leans further toward financial stability and a
more sustainable growth trajectory,” the ADB said.

China has set its GDP target at around 6.5% for FY 2018.

Some of the policy decisions by Modi government have been blamed by the
opposition as the reasons behind declining growth and job creation rates.
These include demonetisation decision and GST rollout.

The ADB report noted that India’s growth rate dip to 6.6 per cent in FY 17 was
“driven in part by the lingering effect of demonetisation”. The sudden
withdrawal of old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes had severely impacted the
informal sector in the first half of last financial year.

The growth rate was also affected by “teething issues related to the
implementation of Goods and Services Tax”, ADB said.

ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said, “Despite the short-term costs, the
benefits of reform—such as the recently implemented GST—will propel India’s
future growth.”

Economy and jobs would be two big issues on which Modi will be tested in 2019
elections.

In the wake of demonetisation decision in 2016, the opposition had predicted
the GDP growth would decline by two per cent. Around 1.5 years after
demonetisation, the economy, however, now looks set to move on a high-growth
trajectory once again. Modi won’t expect for a better news in an election
year.

&gt; ... For the Allahabad High Court, name of Barshad Ali Khan is **pending with the Central Government since 04.04.2016** after recommendation of the collegium. And the name of Muhammed Mansoor is **pending with Central Government since 16.11.2016**.

&gt; For the Calcutta High Court, name of Mohammed Nizamuddin was initially recommended by Supreme Court Collegium, which was **returned by Central Government on 11.11.2016. The collegium again recommended the name on 15.11.2016 and that was returned again on 01.03.2017. The Collegium reiterated the name once again on 07.04.2017 and the name is still pending with the Central Government**...The Calcutta High Court is functioning at less than half the strength of sanctioned posts of 72, with 33 judges. **So much so that Calcutta lawyers called for five days strike to protest delay in filling up of vacancies.**

&gt; For Karnataka High Court, **the name of Narendra Prasad is also pending with the Central Government for 11 months . Following a hunger strike staged by Karnataka lawyers for filling up vacancies, the Centre notified the appointment** of five judges in Karnataka High Court. For Madras High court, the names of 9 persons including the name of  Subrahmaniam Prasad, who is a  Senior Advocate in the Supreme Court, are pending since 04.12.2017 with the Central Government...

&gt; Though the Central Government is bound by the recommendation of the collegium, there is no stipulation as to the time frame within which the collegium recommendations have to be considered.  **It appears that the Central Government is making use of this loophole of lack of time-limit by sitting over files to defeat collegium recommendations.**

&gt; **The data collected by Live Law research team reveals that a staggeringly high number of more than 146 names are pending for judicial appointment. Most of such names are pending at the Government level, after clearance by the Supreme Court Collegium.**

&gt; **What Prevents CJI To Request The Union To Take Time Bound Decision On Recommendations?**

&gt; **The data shows that Governmental inaction is at a height when it comes to appointment of judges and filling of vacancies in the judiciary**. In a country with enormous dunes of piled up cases and more number being filed every single day, what is it that we legitimately expect from our government? Isn’t the government aware of its crucial role in setting the justice delivery system in smooth functioning, with adequate number of judges to handle the work load?

&gt; ... This puts a former CJI to much stress, and **that was what the nation witnessed when CJI Thakur failed to veil his emotions at a public function and had to dry his eyes, while speaking of the judicial workload**. Imagine, the CJI of this country had to literally plead to the government to fill judicial posts and to appoint adequate number of judges. **The Prime Minister Narendra Modi who witnessed the candid disclosure of feelings by the Hon’ble CJI, responded in his usual masterly style stating that he was not a person who would merely walk away from issues of importance**; the Prime Minister assured that he would study the matter seriously and would find a way. All this happened in April 2016. The “way” is yet to be unraveled.

&gt; The names of Justice K. M. Joseph and Indu Malhotra, Senior Advocate, have been pending with the Govenrment after their recommendations to elevation as SC judges by collegium during January 2018. **Reportedly, the Centre is not favouring the elevation of Justice Joseph, and is objecting to his elevation for no reasons. However, the real reason for the objection is widely speculated as the Centre’s unhappiness over Justice Joseph rendering judgment against the Centre by quashing imposition of presidential rule in Uttarakhand in May 2016**.  The artificial objection on seniority does not hold water, and appears to be an empty ruse to block the elevation of Justice Jospeh. ",2018-04-12 21:53:07

**Caught On Camera: Lawmakers 'Snacking' In Pune During Fast, This Time It's The BJP** 

 ______ 
The BJP leaders were seen snacking on sandwiches and chips in a video that
went viral on social media.

**Pune: **

There were red faces in the BJP after two of its legislators were found
snacking on sandwiches and chips as the party leaders and cadres led by Prime
Minister Narendra Modi observed a day's fast across India on Thursday.

The development came three days after the Bharatiya Janata Party criticized
the Congress when some of its Delhi leaders were seen eating out at a
restaurant prior to its fast on Monday.

Two BJP legislators -- Bhimrao Tapkir and Sanjay Bhegade alias Bala -- were
filmed 'breaking' their fast mid-way during an official meeting convened in
the Pune Council Hall by Guardian Minister Girish Bapat.

A video clipping of the two chomping on sandwiches and chips went viral on the
social media and was broadcast by television channels, even as embarrassed
state BJP leaders kept mum.

In a statement, Maharashtra Congress President Ashok Chavan said that the
""drama of fasting will not work anymore"" as the people are no longer
interested in government's false promises.

""In Pune, the BJP leaders were seen enjoying snacks in the middle of the fast,
elaborate arrangements were made for serving snacks before launching the
'fast' and after completing it. This fast is just a farce,"" Mr Chavan said
dismissively during a media briefing.

""If somebody eats three hours before a fast, BJP finds it objectionable, but
it is okay for them if they eat during the fast. The reason behind today's
fasting programme is bogus, the sentiments are bogus and the fast itself is
bogus,"" said state Congress Spokesperson Sachin Sawant.

Incidentally, it is not clear how the video clip of the BJP legislators
enjoying the snack during the fast came into the public domain as the party
had issued strict instructions against any publicity stunts on social media
networks.

The call for a day-long fast by the BJP leaders led by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi was given to protest the washout of the second half of parliament's
budget session.

__ Comments

The BJP alleged that the Congress did not allow parliament to function,
initially on account of the bank scams. Thereafter, the YSR Congress and TDP
created hurdles on the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh and moved
no-confidence motions against the government.

**Chandrababu Naidu declares ‘war’ against Modi-led NDA govt, equates it with British Raj** 

 ______ 
A “war” against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government headed by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had begun, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N
Chandrababu Naidu said on Thursday equating Modi’s rule with the British Raj.

“The people will not give up the fight till they pull down the government,”
added president of the Telugu Desam Party that pulled out of the BJP-led NDA
last month over the Centre’s failure to grant special category status to
Andhra Pradesh.

“Modi has betrayed the faith we had reposed in the last four years. Now, it is
time to wage a war against him and teach him a befitting lesson for his great
betrayal,” Naidu said after inaugurating the Andhra Pradesh Police Technology
Centre at Amaravati, the proposed capital of the bifurcated state.

Earlier in the day, while interacting with his cabinet colleagues, Naidu said
there was no difference between the British government (of pre-Independence
period) and the present BJP government at the Centre.

“Have you ever seen a Prime Minister going on hunger strike in the history of
the country? He is trying to blame it on the people of the state for his
inability to run the Parliament. He is trying to instigate his party cadre
against us and gain political mileage,” Naidu alleged.

The TDP president claimed that Modi had denied special category status and
other benefits to Andhra Pradesh only because of political reasons.

“Now, he is trying to provoke other states against us. He takes pleasure in
stalling development of our state. Unfortunately, some parties in the state
are supporting Modi for their own political benefits,” he said.

Referring to the state-wide bandh call given by “Pratyeka Hoda Sadhana
Samithi” (Committee to achieve special category status for AP) on April 16 to
protests against the BJP government’s denial of special status to the state,
the chief minister said strikes and shutdowns would cause more harm to the
state than highlighting the issue.

“We need to educate the people against the Modi government and take the battle
to Delhi. What is the point in stalling the development in the state? It will
make Modi happier,” he added.

**BJP leaders take up deeksha in support of Modi**

Meanwhile, the BJP leaders, including MPs, MLAs and MLCs, took part in one-day
deeksha in different parts of the state to express their solidarity with the
Prime Minister and BJP president Amit Shah staged one-day fasting to register
their protest against recent Parliament logjam.

On the other hand, activists of TDP, Left parties and other organisations
demanding special category status protested against the one-day-long fast
undertaken by BJP leaders across the state on Thursday.

In Vijayawada, Eluru, Bhimavaram and Visakhapatnam the agitators were taken
into police custody as they came into blows with the BJP activists. In several
places TDP Legislators and workers undertook Padayatra’s protesting against
BJP leader’s hunger strike.

Alleging that the TDP was behind these attacks, BJP spokesperson GVL Narsimha
Rao, who sat on fast in Vijayawada Dharna Chowk, said that permission to hold
the day-long fast in Lenin Centre was denied at the behest of the ruling TDP.

State BJP president Kambhampati Haribabu in Visakhapatnam said that Naidu and
the city police commissioner Yoganand had provided moral support to the
attackers.

If it does the only solution to the problem isn't forcing the central government the courts judjement to release more water to Tamil Nadu or whatever.
Agricultural infrastructure is lacking behind in India as a whole. Most farmers depend upon seasonal rains and nerby water bodies for irrigation in the 21 St century.

Why don't you promt the state government to improve the agricultural infrastructure instead you strating hastags on Twitter.
Your state can lead the way in agricultural development instead of leading the way in following useless propaganda.

This is not a political issue. Politicians are brainwashing you to believe it is. Your are like a puppet. 

There are farmers on both sides of the border who are in desperate condition and instead to helping them you start a has tag on Twitter.

Politicians havead this a tamilians vs kannadigas fight or a Tamillians vs BJP fight.

It is neither of them. Farmers are suffering because of corrupt and ignorant politicans. Protest against their incompetence help the farmers by demanding for better infrastructure structure isntead of forming a mob.

I have no idea why your so proud to be recognized as a tamilian. The politicans are using this mentality to put you against your kannadiga counter parts across the border.

Finally we are all poor Indians governed moslty corrupt people who try and make a profit of our misery. Fight as one against this cause.

GST is a good thing for the economy. It reduces bureaucracy. As proof, most of the world's top economic powers have GST. It was just introduced very badly because Modi is not the best economist in India (understatement).

However, you don't need complex economic policies to solve our problem. What Congress did was increase subsidies for the poor to win votes while corrupt ministers took bribes to pass tax cuts for the rich. If the government has more money going out (subsidies) and less money coming in (tax cuts for rich ppl), there is going to be a deficit. The solution is simple, decrease subsidies and increase taxes which Modi has done. In this year's annual budget, the government announced an increase in capital gains tax which is a tax on rich ppl.

Asifa rape case: Congress president Rahul Gandhi at the midnight candlelight
vigil at India Gate

**NEW DELHI: **

Congress president Rahul Gandhi

led a candlelight march to India Gate

in the heart of the national capital at midnight to demand justice for the

young girl gang-raped and killed

in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua and the alleged

rape of a teenager in Unnao

. Sonia Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Vadra Gandhi joined the protests that are
seen to be an effort to put the ruling BJP at the centre and the two states in
a spot. The protest brought back memories of the spontaneous waves of protests
that slammed India Gate after the Nirbhaya gang-rape five years ago and forced
parliament to enact tougher rape laws.

by the

""The accident took place at Vayalar Junction on Wednesday morning when Pillai,
a native of Charamoodu in Alappuzha, was being taken to a private hospital in
Kochi by his relatives for a medical check-up,"" Pattanakad sub-inspector B
Shajimon said.

A lorry rammed into the car in which Gopinath was travelling. He was
undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kochi where he died today,"" said
the SI.

A case has been registered in this regard, the sub-inspector said.

Pranesh fell in love with neighbour Sajida alias Ishrat Jahan in Pune and they
married in 1995. Ishrat, a Thane resident, was 19 when she became a salesgirl
in his perfume business. Her elder brother was Pranesh's friend, say sources.
Just weeks later, both employer and employee were dead. Their bodies lay
sprawled on a road on Ahmedabad's outskirts, near a bullet-riddled car.

Gujarat Police claimed Pranesh aka Javed, Ishrat, and Pakistanis Amjad Ali and
Jishan Johar Abdul Ghani were Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives on a mission to
assassinate chief minister Narendra Modi.

It is also to be noted that one of the flagship schemes of Modi has been Save the Girl Child - Beti Padhaao, Beti Bachaoo. Not really good thing for his own so called government schemes when his minions are raping and vandalising the country. 

So all Modi defenders should realise that it is easier to point fingers than to really follow thru with your promises. ",2018-04-13 14:40:10

No fucking way, one Babri demolition aftermath was enough for them. Many all over the country droped their swords and dropped it all for good. But you pissants, don't like that, because you want to show Hindu is in Danger. You all will not allow them to live in peace because most of the Muslims chose India as their Motherland, not Pakistan and you don't have that tolerance for it.

For that you will do more harm and will brazenly do it, because now you all have the licence and blessing, that's why you all made him reach to the top post.

Just because he believed in working more than speaking he was labelled as a silent PM. There are several statements that were given by MMS during the parliamentary sessions - not verbally but were given to the Parliament and even the press. 
MMS was a veteran in terms of public policy and while he was given a hard time no one remembered the fact that he was the economist who actually took India out in 1990, then in 2008 and then again in 2010. When the world was reeling under the worst economic meltdowns, India was not affected. Modi on the other hand was given a robust economy and short of throwing all away he has done nothing. Demonetisation was a joke, and data and analysis have proven over and again that it was a bad move. Oil prices have consistently increased and thanks to crackdowns against his dissenters - a robust economy which fed labourers is now bleeding the poor to death.

327,"**It’s not as if the prime minister has not been able to find the time. He has been active on social media during this period when the horrific incident grabbed media headlines. Modi was busy tweeting congratulations to scientists on the successful launch of a navigation satellite, sharing a video on a yoga posture, greeting Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on her birthday, felicitating swachchagrahis in Motihari and so on. In other words, the prime minister appears to have tweeted about every other consequential and inconsequential event other than the horrifying and tragic Kathua incident. Neither has external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj – projected as the “compassionate” face in the cabinet – condemned the incident or condoled with the family.**

The usually voluble prime minister’s disturbingly frequent refuges in silence became evident early on when he came to power in 2014. Even after more than four years in office, Modi today remains reluctant to condemn communal or gender related violence, especially when the victims are Muslims. Perhaps the only time he broke his silence and condemned an incident of sectarian violence was when the victims were Dalits and the crime occurred in his home state of Gujarat. Facing flak from all quarters for the Una violence – and the prospect of Dalit anger in different states – Modi finally spoke up. One cannot but recall that this is the very same BJP which used to call the then Congress prime minister Manmohan Singh – ‘Maun Mohan’ – for his protracted silences. But Singh unlike Modi, was not a voluble politician. He did not have Modi’s gift of gab. Nor was he immersed in the world of social media.

Silence is natural to Singh’s personality, just like speech and words and tweets are to Modi. The present prime minister likes to speak in abstract generalisations and coin catchy slogans like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. But he retreats into silence when betis are subjected to violence, even killed. He never tires of talking about his pet project Swachch Bharat. But he doesn’t speak about the caste oppression of manual scavengers or sanitation workers.

MNS didn't have such backing, until now. But if you follow news, Raj is now a student of Sharad Pawar. NCP directly and openly supports MNS and Raj. 

Modi and co are scared shit.

1. 65 toll nakas closed within a week of agitation
2. Marathi language on call audios within 1 month

So now, Pawar was doing all inside but from Gudi Padwa he shocked all those who give a rats ass about MH politics by openly supporting Raj. He doesn nothing, he just stays in the shadows and screws with BJP, why?

1. After him, there won't be any influential MH leader if he doesn't prep Raj
2. He said so indirectly in the interview Raj took of him. Raj had asked, ""Delhi or MH"", he said "" To protect MH, I need to control Delhi""


In the same interview, he had said nobody can break Mumbai from MH and even if they do, will you sit quietly? The significane of this statement? You'll fuck them.

PM Modi took a ride on the Delhi Metro from Lok Kalyan Marg station to Alipur
Road

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today took the metro from an underground station
near his official residence to travel to north Delhi for an event at a
memorial dedicated to BR Ambedkar,

the architect of the constitution and a Dalit icon

.

His destination was 26 Alipur Road, an address in one of the most crowded
parts of the capital. There he dedicated the Ambedkar memorial to the nation,
to mark the birth anniversary of the icon on Saturday.

Ringed by Special Protection Group commandos, PM Modi boarded the metro from
the Lok Kalyan Marg station. It was seen as a good plan, since travelling by
road would have meant a huge security nightmare and traffic jams.

station

His entry caused a commotion among riders on their way home during rush hour
on Friday.

They took turns taking selfies with the Prime Minister, who obliged as many
co-passengers as he could.

As one man stayed firmly by his side, trying to take a selfie, the Prime
Minister was seen asking him to make way for a woman rider who was standing.

__ Comments

No one could linger too long as the security personnel quickly moved them
away.

PM Narendra Modi arrived for the opening of a memorial dedicated to BR
Ambedkar

The memorial at Alipur Road is designed to look like the constitution and has
been built in two years at a cost of Rs 100 crore.

Ambedkar died at this address, which is spread over nearly two acres.

""To stand at the same place where Babasaheb breathed his last is an honour for
me,"" PM Modi said at the memorial.

He was CM of Gujrat. Gujarat did well in many fronts. Those were highlighted. Now he is not CM of Gujarat. He is PM of India.This change. He can't look give a speech without mentioning Congress.

They have always highlighted all the law and order issues.Remember Singur ? Or the AIIMS reservations protests. Media has always highlighted govt's faults.

**Our daughters will get justice, culprits won't be spared: PM Modi on rape cases** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Breaking his silence on the

Unnao

and

Kathua

rape cases, Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

today said those who commit crimes against women will not be spared.

""Incidents being discussed since past two days cannot be part of a civilised
society. As a country, as a society we all are ashamed of it. I want to assure
the country that no culprit will be spared, complete justice will be done. Our
daughters will definitely get justice,"" PM Modi said during the inauguration
of Dr

Ambedkar

National Memorial here.

The Prime Minister urged people to work together and rid society of the evil
of rape and sexual

violence against women

. For this, he said, change needs to begin with the family by inculcating
social values in the children.

""When a daughter comes home late, we're quick to ask them where they have
been. But when a son returns late at night, we should ask them the same
question,"" he said.

""We have to strengthen our family system, our social values and law and
order,"" he added.

Outrage over the gruesome gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old in Jammu
and Kashmir’s Kathua and the gangrape of another minor in Uttar Pradesh's
Unnao grew across the country on Thursday and Friday, with people taking to
the streets and demanding strict action against the perpetrators.

Amid the outcry, the Prime Minister came under fire for his muted response to
the crimes. The ruling BJP, too, was slammed by Congress and other opposition
parties over allegations of shielding the accused and delayed action in the
rape cases.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who led a candlelight vigil last night, had
questioned the PM's silence and wondered if his slogan 'Beti Bachao' was mere
lip service.

""Today, India's women are afraid of coming out in public. Women and girls are
being killed and raped. I only want to say that the government should do
something about the plight of women and the crimes against them,"" Rahul had
said.

**""No Culprit Will Be Spared"": PM Amid Anger Over Kathua And Unnao Rape Cases** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said ""As a society, we are all ashamed of it (the
rape cases)""

**New Delhi: **

In his first remarks on the Kathua and Unnao rape cases, which have sparked
nationwide outrage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said no culprit will be
spared. ""Incidents being discussed since past two days cannot be part of a
civilised society. As a country, as a society we all are ashamed of it,"" the
prime minister said.

""I want to assure the country that no culprit will be spared, complete justice
will be done. Our daughters will definitely get justice,"" PM Modi added while
speaking in Delhi this evening.

Earlier today, Congress president Rahul Gandhi had challenged PM Modi to speak
up on the two rape cases, calling his silence ""unacceptable"".

""What do you think about the growing violence against women and children? Why
are accused rapists and murderers protected by the state?"" Rahul Gandhi had
tweeted.

Rahul Gandhi had led a

midnight march to India Gate

in the heart of Delhi demanding justice for the eight-year-old girl who was
kidnapped, brutally assaulted and killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua in
January, and for the 16-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao who was
allegedly raped by BJP lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar last year.

Mr Gandhi had said last night that the

Beti _Bachao_ (Save the girl child) slogan is good

. ""We are telling him (PM Modi) that he should get down to the job, implement
it,"" the Congress president had said during the protests that are seen to be
an effort to put the ruling BJP at the centre and the two states in a spot.

Rahul Gandhi had led a midnight march to India Gate at midnight demanding
justice in Kathua, Unnao rape cases

Hundreds of people, predominantly Congress workers, had joined the march,
responding to Mr Gandhi's call to join him for ""a silent, peaceful,
candlelight vigil"" to protest violence against women and demand justice. The
Congress today said it will

stage protests across the country

demanding justice in the two cases.

Though the

Kathua rape and murder took place in January

, central politicians were largely silent until details in a police
chargesheet revealed the sheer cruelty and horror that the child was subjected
to before she was killed.

__ Comments

Meanwhile, in Uttar Pradesh,

Kuldeep Singh Sengar has paraded around all week

long denying the accusation of rape, disparaging the girl and her family and
hitting out at the media in the Unnao rape case. During that time, his brother
Atul Singh was arrested for a

brutal assault on the girl's father

, who was not just arrested with severe wounds on his body but who died on
Monday in custody.

Kuldeep Sengar was taken in for questioning

by the CBI early this morning. The

Allahabad High Court today severely reprimanded the Yogi Adityanath government

, and said the approach of the government law officer that the lawmaker could
not be arrested at this stage ""not only exudes an unpleasant flavour"" but
raises doubts about the bona fides of top police officers.

**UK seeking agreement with India on mutual recognition of degrees** 

 ______ 
With 14,000 Indian students pursuing advanced masters’ degrees in the UK,
London wants to get an agreement of mutual recognition of qualifications with
India much like the pact signed recently between France and India.

That is unusual in itself, given that Indians generally value British
educational degrees. But with Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

travelling to the UK for a bilateral summit and CHOGM meet next week, UK high
commissioner to India, Dominic

Asquith

said such a pact would be important for Indian students.

India does not recognise a one-year masters degree which is given by all
British universities, since India has a two-year degree. This, Asquith said,
made it difficult for Indian students to pursue a doctorate in India after a
Masters in the UK.

“We would be delighted if we could replicate it,” he said referring to the
recent India-France agreement. “Discussions are under way, we would like them
to be concluded soon.” There has been a 27 per cent increase in Indian
students to the UK, he said, and Indians get the biggest chunk of work visas
issued by the British government.

The bilateral summit, Asquith said, would stress on the “technology
partnership”, which was started a while ago. This includes British companies
“creating in India” — “we’re looking at collaborative ventures in design,
building, technology etc”. India-UK trade, he said, had risen by 15 per cent
in the past year; Indian issuers had raised 5.3 billion pounds in the London
Stock Exchange and India is the fourth largest investor in the UK. A
significant outcome of the summit is likely to be focused on data protection
and cybersecurity.

The difficult conversation will be on Russia’s involvement in the poisoning of
Sergei Skripal, a Russian double agent in Salisbury, which triggered a huge
exodus of Russian diplomats from different western countries. “Russia will
have to answer some difficult questions. They have so far only deflected them
and tried to obstruct investigations,” Asquith said, referring to the
administration of the nerve agent novichok on Skripal and his daughter.
However, India will find it hard to condemn Russian actions with the UK, given
India’s traditional ties with Moscow.

**Narendra Modi says no culprit will be spared amid outrage over over Kathua, Unnao rapes** 

 ______ 
Crimes against women will not go unpunished, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi
on Friday in comments that are being seen as his first public response to the
gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old child in Jammu and Kasmhir’s Kathua,
and a teenager’s allegation that a lawmaker of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) had raped her in Uttar Pardesh’s Unnao.

“The incidents that we have seen in the last few days, they challenge the idea
of social justice. In the last two days, the incidents which are being talked
about certainly doesn’t behove any civilized country. It is shameful, “ the
prime minister said a function to inaugurate a memorial for BR Ambedkar, the
architect of India’s constitution.

Stating that Indians are ashamed of such incidents, he said they are an insult
to sacrifices of Army jawans who have laid down their lives for the country.

“In any corner of the country, in any state, such incidents shake our human
sensibilities. I want to assure that no culprit will be spared. There will be
justice and there will be full justice,” he promised.

“I want to assure the country that the Government of India will do everything
possible bring these culprits to justice,” he said.

Modi made the comments even as demonstrations are planned across India to
protest the rape and murder of the eight-year-old girl in Kathua . She was
tortured and killed allegedly because the accused wanted to scare away members
of her nomadic Muslim Bakarwal community.

His comments are also being seen as a reference to Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the
legislator who was on Friday detained by the Central Bureau of Investigation
in connection with charges that he raped a 17-year-old girl in Unnao district
of Uttar Pradesh.

Modi said Indians have to come together to stop the “internal evils of our
society.”

“They, who commit crimes against our mothers and sisters, are also sons of a
mother. And that’s why, (developing) this social sensibilities are our
collective responsibility. We have to fight together against these social ills
and bring the culprits to justice,” the prime minister said.

384,"Hatred for Modi is not related to my argument at all. But I guess the disconnect is probably because of the drinks and the other comments on this post.

People from TN disliking Modi is partly the Hindi-only stance people associate the BJP with and the assumption that BJP is biased towards Hindutva and thrives on religious rifts. I'm not going to comment on whether these assumptions are right or wrong. But in a state where Temples, Mosques, and Churches peacefully coexist side by side, one can imagine why religious division creating people will be looked down upon.

Add to that the fact that 2015 floods happened during his reign and that, in the public's eye, Modi hasn't spent as much time nor given as much priority to TN, and you have grounds for people to errect monuments of hate upon.

We as a nation love to hate. So when a person's actions or even rumours about their actions give us ammo to hate, we go ahead and hate.

Also, as I said: people here are NOT against learning or speaking Hindi (though some are annoyed that it's a mandatory second or third language). 

They are against being *forced* to speak or read Hindi. 

When given a choice, many people would use Hindi if it made communication easier. 

Anecdotal evidence: all the times Tamil people have spoken to me in Hindi here in their state. Also, several people from N and NE have settled and lived here for generations without a problem.

The hatred comes in when you say ""No, you must ONLY use Hindi.""

When you try to replace Tamil on markers in a state where people predominantly speak Tamil with Hindi.

411,"Brother, I assure you, as bad as Modi is, Trump is worse. As someone who has spent a some time there in the last few years, he has single handedly brought down the image of US globally. Here is a small list of things he has done:

1. Had sex with a pornstar while his wife was pregnant
2. Has openly talking about having sex with his daughter
3. Has openly refered her daughter as a ""fine piece of ass""
4. Obstructed justice, and openly bragged about it
5. Has openly talked about sexually harrasing women, and in his defense, simply said, when you are rich, you can do whatever you want
6. Openly praised dictators, and has asked why arent people loyal to him, and why are they not doing what he wants, rather than what is right (the second point applies to Modi as well)
7. Berated his officials for not commiting genocide on civilians

So, while I agree, Modi is pretty bad for our country, Trump is an actual rapist. And a serial one at that. Possibly incestuous rapist as well.

2. In Kathua, how dare People promote brutality with the national flag? Is it not an act that needs admonishing? Why was she raped? Why was she killed? To spread fear among tribes? 

3. Agenda starts #pmsavehindusofjammu. Why is it not, pmsavepeopleofjammu? For gods sake can we just kick religion out for 1 second? Rather than play blamegame.

Why don't you fucking throw them to jail? Also NCRB puts up one fact. 67% of undertrials get acquitted in one or two years. So that means we use the prison more of as a Fear Cell than a Prison?

**Tamil Singer Kovan Arrested For Song Criticising PM Modi, Rath Yatra** 

 ______ 
In 2015, Mr Kovan was arrested for allegedly criticising then Chief Minister
Jayalalithaa

**Chennai: **

Tamil folk singer Kovan has been arrested for a song that criticises PM
Narendra Modi besides taking dig at Chief Minister E Palaniswami and his
deputy O Panneerselvam.

The song that also takes on the recent Rath Yatra by Sree Rama Dasa Mission
Universal Society

that entered Tamil Nadu amid protests

by opposition parties, went viral on video sharing platform Youtube.

The video shows visuals of the Rath Yatra and Isha Foundation's Sadhguru Jaggi
Vasudev dancing with the song in the background.

Police say the action was taken after a complaint by BJP's youth wing
secretary in Trichy, N Goutham. Investigators have registered a case of
promoting enmity, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, intent to
cause mutiny and alarm.

In the song, Mr Kovan says, ""The story of a rule with slippers is in Ramayana.
In Tamil Nadu Modi's two slippers rule."" In the song, Mr Kovan also attacks PM
Modi on the Cauvery issue.

state government's liquor policy. The song was viral on social media.

The Chennai police then said, ""It was a personal attack on Jayalalithaa and it

The case is still pending and Mr Kovan, a member of Makkal Kalai llakkiya
Kazhagam, is out on bail.

Modiji finally opened his mouth after 5 days and the things he said were meaningless. There were no words spoken on the agitation by the lawyers, on why the father of the Unnao survivor was arrested and killed etc. He said something without saying anything.

Yogi is on another level. UP police literally refused to arrest the BJP MLA. On the chargesheet filed against his brother for the killing of the victim's father, his name was omitted. And Yogi also withdrew a rape case against a former minister. That's how serious Yogi is.

&gt; The BJP ministers have been forced to resign and the BJP MLA has been arrested.

The BJP ministers were forced to resign after the protests became so widespread that it was hard for the Govt. to ignore. Instead of leading and taking the initiative, the govt. only listened after the protests became too loud to ignore. And the BJP MLA was arrested by the CBI who were handed the case because the UP Police refused to arrest the accused.

You also ignored the press conference by Meenakshi Lekhi which was arrogant and full of whataboutism. Was that intentional?

There have been multiple people from the party supporting the rapists and making retarded statements. You chose to ignore all those points didn't you? And only picked up points and twisted them so that they fit your narrative. Wow. You really are shameless, aren't you?

You said that the rohingya settlements in Jammu made the Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists uncomfortable. Yet, only the Hindu Ekta Manch took out a rally. I wonder why.

&gt; I literally said the call for the CBI inquiry was unnecessary but these protestors had serious reservations about the investigation.

**Top insecure, no PMO weaker than one in power today: Arun Shourie** 

 ______ 
Renowned journalist and former Union Minister

Arun Shourie

on Sunday alleged that there is too much centralisation of power in the Prime
Minister's Office because of the insecurity of the ""top boss""

Narendra Modi

.

He also said that ""falsehood"" was the ""hallmark"" of the Modi government and it
has failed to fulfill several promises such as on generating

jobs

.

Participating at the Times Lit Fest here, Shourie, who was a minister in the
Atal Bihari Vajpayee's NDA government, said: ""A person who is psychologically
secure, he will not be nervous of any situation. And a person who is
psychologically insecure will never allow others who have a base of expertise
to come near (him).""

""Today donkeys have become horses. And the leader can choose who he will be
surrounded by,"" said Shourie, who is a leading critic of Modi's Bharatiya
Janata Party-led government.

He also said that ""today there is a greater centralisation of power in the
PMO"".

""There has been never a weaker PMO because of the insecurity of the top boss
(Modi). Similarly the ministers and the Chief Ministers, those who are chosen
like (Maharastra Chief Minister Devendra) Fadnavis, (Haryana Chief Minister
Manohar Lal) Khattar, (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi) Adityanath (he is an
exception). And all the persons those who have no base can never threaten
you....."" he said

He also said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government was very
sensitive to criticism.

""Now Modi Saheb never says 'Mitron', as he was ridiculed on the social media.
Similarly the way in which he used acronyms in the very first year but after
being ridiculed, he stopped using it.

He also said that he finds Modi as a ""very astute politician"". ""If he realises
that he has not been able to deliver on his promises of development, therefore
they (BJP) have to revert to the only trick they know that is to divide the
people and conquer,"" he said.

Citing the government's ""falsehoods"". Shourie said said that he can give many
examples of that in the form of full page advertisements in the newspapers
showing ""government statistics of generating over five and half crore job by
MUDRA scheme"" only.

""But we should not be surprised at this.... falsehood has become the hallmark
of this government,"" he said.

Shourie also stressed that we should not examine what a person or leader has
been doing for a long time but examine their work ""minutely"".

Citing

Mahatma Gandhi

, he said: ""Very important point that Gandhiji use to make 'don't go by what
he has been doing but go by his character' and 'what can you learn about his
character?'.

""And we have missed that twice both in the case of (former Prime Minister)
V.P. Singh and Narendra Modi. They just say whatever is convenient at the
moment,"" he said.

Slamming the government over the short

winter session of Parliament

, Shourie said: ""Today we are surprised by the centralisation of the power but
that is the Gujarat model.

""We have been surprised as the cabinet has reduced to a nullity but that is
the Gujarat model... we are surprised by the fact that the Parliament has been
reduced to the status of the state assembly but that was the Gujarat model...
and all the agencies and institutions are being the instruments of a coterie
but that is the Gujarat model.""

He also slammed the government over issues like intolerance, violence and even
the debate over ideological differences.

**Hope authorities bring Kathua rape perpetrators to justice: UN**

By:

PTI

| United Nations |

Published: April 14, 2018 11:52:24 am

UN chief Antonio Guterres has expressed hope that the authorities will bring
perpetrators of the brutal crime to justice. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File

Terming as “horrific” the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu
and Kashmir’s Kathua district, UN chief Antonio Guterres has expressed hope
that the authorities will bring perpetrators of the brutal crime to justice.

The girl from the nomadic Bakerwal Muslim community disappeared near her house
on January 10 and a week later, her body was found in the same area.

She was allegedly raped by six men who had held her in captivity in a village
temple for a week in January. The victim was drugged, rapped repeatedly before
being bludgeoned to death. The incident has sparked outrage across India.

“I think we’ve seen the media reports of this horrific case, of the abuse and
the murder of a young girl. We very much hope that the authorities will bring
the perpetrators to justice so they can be held accountable for the murder of
this young girl,” Guterres’ spokesperson Stephane Dujjaric told reporters at
his daily press briefing here yesterday.

Dujjaric was responding to a question about the Secretary General’s response
to the rape and murder of the girl.

A Special Investigation Team of Crime Branch, formed to probe the incident,
has arrested eight people, including two special police officers (SPOs) and a
head constable and a sub-inspector, who were charged with destroying evidence.

Expressing anguish over the incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday
called it as a “shame” for the country and asserted that the guilty will not
be spared.

“I want to assure the nation that no criminal will be spared. Justice will be
done. Our daughters will get justice,” he said.

**Petitioner In Ishrat Jahan Case Dies In Road Accident, Probe Underway** 

 ______ 
Ishrat Jahan Case: Gopinath Pillai died on Friday morning.

**New Delhi: **

One of the petitioners in the Ishrat Jahan case, Gopinath Pillai, died today
after a road accident in Kerala. Gopinath Pillai was the father of Pranesh
Kumar Pillai, who, along with

Ishrat Jahan

and two others, was shot dead by the Gujarat police in 2004.

Gopinath Pillai, a retired teacher, was on his way to Kochi for a medical
check-up on Wednesday morning when his Maruti car reportedly braked suddenly
and was rear-ended by a truck. The car was wrecked and Mr Pillai, 77, was
rushed to hospital with multiple wounds. He died this morning.

Ishrat Jahan was shot dead in June 2004.

""The probe is underway. A case of accident was registered yesterday itself. We
are probing all angles and can't specify anything till the probe is over,""
sources in police told NDTV.

Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old college student,

Pranesh and the two others were shot dead near Ahmedabad in June, 2004.
Gujarat police officers claimed that the four were Lashkar e Taiba terrorists
who had planned to assassinate Narendra Modi, who was then Chief Minister of
Gujarat.

__ Comments

This version was challenged in court by Gopinath Pillai, who demanded a CBI
investigation.

The police said

Pillai's son Pranesh

had changed his name to Javed Sheikh to marry a Muslim woman.

484,"Okay can someone rationally explain why modi is receiving hate right now. Till now he was silent which was pretty horrible. But now that he's given a statement, shouldn't we wait for justice to be served rather than spewing hate? ",2018-04-14 13:22:37
485,"It's sad to see an old fanatic being threatened by current generation of his successors. Yogi will make the same case for Modi once he is elected in office, considering the image local Hindi media like Danik Jagaran has created of him. No major Hindi newspaper  even mentioned on their front page about Child Asifa and BJPs bigotry, they are hiding this from people of Hindi belt. No independent journalism is there. Remember Cobra Post Investigation against Danik Jagaran and how it's editor agreed to even honey trap the political opponents of the BJP? I can tell you there are hundreds of old people regardless of propaganda who are pro poor anti bullshit and  also a lot of young population in UP who can oppose this bullshit. But there is no independent journalism and lots of WhatsApp whataboutry. ",2018-04-14 13:39:23
486,"Key word: Criticism. Not slander, not defamation. Criticism.

I wonder what happens when everyone starts criticizing Modi. How many will he arrest. How many RSS and BJP workers will he send. How many ""morning walks"" will occur.

At one point he has to realize he's fighting the tide and the ocean has turned on him.

Let's not censor ourselves to please the despot.",2018-04-14 13:46:55

488,"Another factor that we are missing out in ""Why we voted for Modi"" is of inefficiency of the Congress led governments (state as well as center) of that time.

In every election we have:

1. First/Second time voters
2. Swing voters
3. Voters who are so much agitated by working of current government that they will vote to anyone, even least promising, to teach a lesson.

Most of these were very well captured by BJP. 

There are many cities or areas of state which, even being under Congress control for long time, did not prosper/progress properly without any reason.

I have been to Pune many years, and this thing is evident in the city. The city has been growing for almost last 2 decades due to Automobiles first and then IT. But there has been no proper development has been done, no major changes been done to improve city infrastructure, no major projects to support growing population, not enough space for affordable living etc. The only major thing happened was the Mumbai - Pune express way that too was under Nitin Gadkari. Similar examples are there for other cities too.

Without any substantial improvements, these kind of cities/regions went to BJP mostly due to disappointed voters in Congress Government.",2018-04-14 14:10:08
489,"All the evidence was in front of you, why did you choose to look the other way when people died in mysterious circumstances to protect Modi after 2002.

490,"I would say your thought process is quite self-serving given you want India to focus on `culture` and only send best of its talent to America so that you can feel proud, have more bragging rights in your social circle. For that you are willing to support a tinpot like Modi or Trump. At least you are consistent. 

India can't afford to be obstinate about preserving the culture when we have 20% of our population still living below poverty &amp; 30% illiterate. Single focus that we should have is to work on policies that provides education, healthcare and other infrastructural pieces to add value. 

Most people are not even capable of differentiating between bad culture &amp; good culture. casteism, patriarchy, women rights violations including domestic abuse, child marriages is sheltered in the name of culture.  

Its not much different from Republican policies of supporting ban on abortion, support for gun laws, denial of climate change, dog whistles to white supremacy etc.

Kejru's party has delivered on 3 out of 4 key promises during election without killing people.
