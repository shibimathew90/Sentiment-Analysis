---

&gt; * Yet behind the soft-focus India that Mr Modi personifies, the contours of a harder-edged regional power are emerging under his leadership.

&gt; * Such has been the case in Indias dealings with China: its generous economic and military aid to Pakistan, Indias eternal rival, and its energetic efforts to prise smaller neighbours such as Nepal and Sri Lanka from Indias orbit have until recently resulted in little more than head-scratching in the Indian capital, Delhi.

&gt; * Mr Modi has signalled this on his recent travels.

&gt; * Now, under Mr Modi, India is stepping up its efforts to gain full admission to the nuclear elite.

1,"&gt; the RBI and Indian economy is more than just a person

The markets lifted up when Modi won the election, in a ""mood swing"" towards acche din, with promised millions in investments all over. A lot of investors, stock brokers, hedge funders etc check the pulse of the ""sentiments"" of the market and the public, based on how some policies are *perceived* to change.",2016-06-20 00:33:12
2,It wasn't Modi who won the election; it was the BJP. The government changing[from a left wing to a right wing with a different approach] is a much more significant event than governor of RBI changing.,2016-06-20 00:34:46
3,"Oh come on, let's not kid ourselves. It was the Modi hype, BJP had nothing else going on for them.

The reality is that behind the scenes, the monetary and economic policies of a nation has a much more profound impact on the lives of its citizens, for a long time to come, compared to some promised infrastructure projects and MOU's of initial investment from foreign investors. A monetary policy affects everyone across the spectrum, immediately. Slight rise/reduction in interest rates or addition/removal of paper money from circulation triggers a chain of events that significantly affects everything from routine FMCG's, to imports and exports, to fuel, to investments and their higher order derivatives etc., each such change in a sector triggering off further changes trickling down its chain of influence and so on to higher orders. Investors, economists, financial experts, stock brokers and foreign multico's all realize this. So when a change in monetary policy is perceived to be impending, it will affect the decisions of quite a few of these investments, long and short term.

While I agree that TOI (and most other mainstream media outlets) specialize in fearmongering/exaggeration, to be fair to the writer, you take the $100b number out of context. Quoting from the article:

&gt;Tens of billions of dollars will flow out, maybe as much as 100 billion **(if this coincides with some other bad news like a further Chinese slowdown or British exit from the European Union).**

So yes, it is possible that coupled with the Brexit, or ongoing slowdown in the Chinese manufacturing and financial sectors, Rajan's exit can add to the overall panic. But I will abstain from defending the author any further, because frankly I have no way of checking these numbers myself. ",2016-06-20 00:46:45

We will never know the reason but corporate financed journalists seem to love him and that does not mean that there isn't a person  better than him in work not media glamor.

If it was left to bjp leadership alone then Agusta, national Herald would have never been even brought up. People even rajan knows who the real target of swamys letter is and that is the reason bjp ignores it, because no one can touch Mr jaitley at the moment. 

Modi should he attacked for stupid policies, of which there are many examples but attacking him because he doesn't rise in defence to every letter /article written against any head is plain stupidity,more so when done for sake of attacking him using a popular figure. 

There is no doubt that rajan did good job but that doesn't mean no one else can do the same. We don't know what the real reason was.  It's all speculations.

12,It was both. Modi needed a party with national reach and cadre like the BJP to get his message across and win votes on a national level. If he were the leader of the AIADMK or Samajwadi Party or NCP he wouldn't have become the PM.,2016-06-20 03:48:34

15,"&gt;But tbh, I'm glad this cult hero is RBI governer and fanboys are taking at least some basic interest in economic policy, rather than blindly following ""Bhai"" and his movies.

I've read hardly any economic arguments from most of Rajan's fanboys. It's just a cult based on emotion and blind assumptions that Rajan = Good somehow, no Rajan = Economic crash and evil crony capitalist govt.

Mark my words. So long as a qualified candidate is named as Rajan's successor the investors / business world will be satisfied and the emotional laymen raging against the Modi government about it will have moved on to some new issue to outrage 1 week after Rajan quits office. The first category just wants someone credible on top, while the second category doesn't really understand economics and are just bandwagoning on an attack-Modi campaign on a random issue.",2016-06-20 04:16:25
16,"&gt; So the message is to **shift the goalposts when fallacies behind the outrage campaign get exposed?**

Yeah because that is what is to be focused on here. Not the fact that Rajan was viciously personally attacked. Because who cares beyond bhakti to his Lordship Modi?

You seem to have some problem with realities. The reality is that Rajan was viciously personally attacked and everyone stood by like a passenger. Now, when this is being pointed out - your point is to show how it used to attack the people who watched? No shit, sire. That is exactly what will and SHOULD happen.",2016-06-20 04:30:19
17,But this modus operandi is good as it attacks modi.  This government is really lucky that people dont want to notice their policies snafus but get swayed by nonsensical issues. ,2016-06-20 04:30:40
18,"RBI is not an independent body, it has less independence than EC or other bodies. Also Central Banks don't enjoy the fierce independence you think they have. It is up to the govt to decide when to replace the central bank governor. Hence Obama rather than giving Ben Bernanke an extension which many in market wanted still choose Yellen. And UK choose a Canadian banker as their central bank governor. 

And more than likely, Rajan would not have lasted a full second term. That's because the govt. wants to implement the Financial Sector Regulatory reforms which would have modified lot of agencies like SEBI, RBI, IRDA etc. Rajan was opposed to it because debt management was not going to be under RBI. Ironically the reforms report was tabled by C Rangarajan a RBI governor himself and he and many other economists including MMS were in favour of letting RBI just handle rupee, interest rates and few banking policies. 

I don't know about  you lot but I feel a lot of people including Rajan, Chidu, MMS, D. Subbarao, Modi, Jaitley have to answer about their utter neglect for the NPA issue which was cropping up since 2009. It was only in 2015 that Modi and co set up the Banks Bureau and other steps and especially after Mallya issue that NPA issue is in national focus. ",2016-06-20 06:16:55

---

&gt;* A newspaper report a week ago that a selection panel would consider a field of candidates rather than directly offer the former IMF chief economist an extension to his three-year term, effectively forcing him to reapply for his own job, may have been the final straw, according to these people and a finance ministry source.

&gt;* Rajan had for weeks faced intense pressure from BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, who, say sources familiar with the matter, was acting with the backing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

&gt;* Swamy, a 76-year-old former Harvard economist, wrote an open letter to Modi a month ago accusing Rajan of being mentally not fully Indian and calling on the prime minister to terminate him with immediate effect.

&gt;* It was Modi who protected him for the longest time but the defence wall collapsed when Rajan entered the no-go zone of politics, one senior RSS official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

&gt;* One senior official said Rajan had signalled his willingness to work until next March - the deadline he had set for completing a clean-up of bad debts in the banking sector.

48,"Yes. And that is why I am not sure why BJP (as a political party) is pursuing it. It is against their political interests to pursue GST. 

Congress is not going to block GST past 2016. In fact, if I was Sonia Gandhi I would want GST to be passed and implemented by 2017. That will ensure that Modi bears the full brunt of it in 2019. 

Had BJP envisaged that they would win 2014, they would have tried to get it passed under Congress regime, but BJP was busy with the NaMo-Advani tussle at that time. 

I don't see how passing GST is going to be helpful to BJP now. Had they passed it in 2014 - Ok. But now it is going to be pretty bad for them.

54,"&gt;1. First things first, I really like Raghuram - he comes as advertised. Hard, tough nosed, theoretical, unflinching, not giving a shit at all about anything other than the 1-2 things that he decided that he had to focus.

Yes it is true somewhat but not entirely. He focuses more on some issues than others but that is because of the nature of office he was given. He was the RBI governer and not finance minister in GOI. His primary job is to keep inflation as low as possible and keep banks as much healthy as possible, so when the govt starts to promote growth they have a good base on which they can rely on if anything goes wrong. High inflation in an economy whose growth is not able to keep up with it would be a disaster. And growth depends on various international factors which can't be weighed accurately at the time of deciding monetary(RBI's job) and fiscal(GOI's) job, so it was a good approach to slowly and steadily decrease interest rates while keeping the inflation demon checked. 

&gt;3. I do, however, feel that his safety first approach works well in crisis very well, but not in 80% of the time - that is non-crisis time. Now, he is doing *exactly* what he is (literally) preaching at the high temple of Austrian economics - frugality, balance sheet strength etc, so I have no grudge with him. 

It is not as much as 2008 crisis time, but world is not recovered from that crisis till now. The 2008 crisis was not handled very well by governments and hence we are seeing a global slowdown in economy. The debt as a % of gdp of the whole globe is more than what it was before the 2008 crisis and that is a very bad indicator. We can look on our neighbor China, they have an established manufacturing sector, and they are feeling a good economic slowdown. Think for a second if RR haven't concentrated more on inflation regulation and would have went all in for growth or say half in ( which btw is not even his job), what scenario we would be looking at in coming 3-4 years? We would have invested more at the time of economic slowdown, and the returns for them would have been not so good and hence would have made our balance sheets a sob story. It was good that he was keeping a good eye on that and hence we can now or after this economic slow down stops, can go to big investors to tell them to invest in us. 


&gt;4. I agree with his USD buying, NPA recognition, electronic payments etc. The place I most differ from him is his demand side approach to Inflation, which in a poor country like ours is just a ridiculous stance to take. The ONLY thing that will bring inflation down in our kind of a country is SUPPLY side increments. Supply side revolution would not happen without capital. Modi is trying to do what he can on the FDI front and I get that in an ideal world, you would first fix the banks and then start lending, but in the real world that is not possible. 

FDI is a foreign money. It doesn't come with a guarantee that it will stay in our market and hence in a world economy as of today, where India lacks solid infrastructure, it is very volatile for India to rely more on increasing supply to curb inflation. We are already seeing what is happening in China now that FDI is not pouring as much as it used to be and how their condition is getting worse day by day. If china has invested more systematically increase domestic demand it would not have been facing the slowdown. 

And RR is also not so much cynical, he is very willing to have a good growth. But he has worked with IMF and had seen how economies without solid infrastructure to fall back to can just fall apart during rough times. And India is no Greece or Austria that a loan from EU can do something, India is huge and it would not be possible for us to get back on our feet if anything goes wrong that easily. So his approach was much more relevant for India. And he still had enough utility left in him for India.

When you are eking out a living from EMI to EMI, really who gives a crap. Saffronisation does not mean English goes out, it means our history textbooks will (might?) see changes.

At the parliamentary elections level the middle class is fickle, they voted in Modi in 2014 and might just vote Pappu in by 2019 or 2024, they see voting as a chore, and will simply vote for the incumbent or anti incumbent based on how the prevailing mood of the electorate (collectively) is. 2014 was a disaster for the UPA because of the IAC movement (which while 2 years prior, was still fresh in the minds of the electorate) and the spate of corruption scandals. The UPA became associated with corruption. 2 years post the elections, already this is fading in the minds of the non politically aware electorate and if Modi and Shah do not manage anti incumbency and fatigue, they might lose this electorate in 2019 itself. 

Gone are the days when an Indira could win election after election, never again will those days come back.

Hello UPA III or Mahagatbandan I.

Not for nothing Modi has a stated aim of doubling farmer income, he must know that if he fails the rural populace, he will be sitting in the opposition faster than you can say anti-incumbency.

Look at the vote share of the NDA in 2004, they retained their typical middle class urban voter base for the most part, but the rural states, esp those hit by severe drought like AP and Maha routed them.

While on the flip side we have the loud, vocal, irrationally angry criticisers who regard any defense or counter-argument as equal to bhakti, IT cell etc. of the government.

&gt;I'm actually being gentle when I speak, this move among many others would have resulted in an incessant haranguing of any other party.

Most of the haranguing right now comes from people who are either critics of the party to begin with or who don't know much better and are being swayed by the media perception being projected.

When former RBI governor D Subbarao was shunted out(Oh sorry, he also 'chose' not to seek an extension) by the UPA due to his disagreements with Chidambaram on interest rates(Sound familiar?) there were eyebrows raised but nowhere near this kind of outrage.

He didn't. His statements about intolerance, one eyed men, and poor analogies with Nazi Germany, etc. embarrassed the government time and again and undermined public confidence.

&gt;Ask most people who lived through the Emergency and they will tell you that on this front of bureaucratic functioning of the State and its services things were rather efficient in relative terms compared to time frame preceding the Emergency.

That's good.

&gt;The ills of the Emergency was in other spheres and that were concerning Political and Liberty driven, etc.

Liberty! Because poverty is so much fun! /s

&gt;Indeed. Mostly because its harder to suppress such a technical based system. Transparency can be done without automation and technology as well but its susceptible to stagnation and exploitation under certain circumstances.

With Rajan’s taking decision on his career move, **Modi-bashers** are having a field day.

&gt; the **Modi government has been extremely fair to Rajan** and allowed him to have the last word on the monetary policy

&gt;“Just because he’s been appointed by someone else **doesn’t mean we have an agenda to remove him**. *No government can dictate to the central bank*. It’s an autonomous body and he holds a constitutional position. We don’t have any likes or dislikes,” Goyal had said.

&gt;In my considered view, *Rajan seems to have been a victim of those who claimed to be his friends*. These friends, almost all of them being **habitual Modi-bashers, succeeded in creating a climate for Rajan to distrust the government**.

Modi is not a bad guy, Rajan is not a bad guy. But this Modi bashers man, they are ASSHOLES. They put the differences between our dear leader and the charismatic Rajan.",2016-06-21 00:25:04

Appreciate the optimism, but who is ""WE"" here? The govt. of India. 

Who controls the GOI? Modi and Jaitely. 

What do they want? To lower interest rates and help business flourish for the donors and other people alike, at expense of possible inflation.

How will they do that? By installing a governor who will deliver what they want.

&gt; One point is that Inflation is not always controlled by interest rates. What if Oil suddenly costs 1000 USD? Petrol and Diesel prices will skyrocket. If Diesel is costlier everything from Milk to vegetable to paani puri will be costlier. 

Who is keeping the Petrol and Diesel prices high by not lowering the taxes after crude oil prices have gone up and causing a direct inflation as a result? Modi and Jaitely.

Does it look like they care about inflation or filling the government treasury and fulfilling the demands of their cronies? You decide.

Edit: On side note, this is really well explained. Would definitely help a lot of common people to get at-least some grasp of the situation.",2016-06-21 00:40:07
114,"&gt; This is crazy! So could Modi effectively do something similar if he wanted to right now?

He does have the constitutional power to declare an Emergency (there are different thing he can do it for, National Security, Financial, etc). 

But i don't think anyone can predict the real odds of such a thing actually happening.   

&gt; Liberty! Because poverty is so much fun! /s

Basically the headlining story of Modern Indian State and its public narrative of itself(Best and Largest Democracy, etc etc).  

When a System becomes more important than the People themselves, take note, that Dogma has achieved primacy and Dogma by very definition means rot has taken root.  

&gt; We need a fucking technocratic party. 

Technocracy like all system has its own pros and cons. 
For a human group which has a lot of illiterate and underdeveloped populace and inefficient resource use, Technocracy is among**THE** best System there is, very few can compete with it in such a scenario.  

Though once pretty much all of the populace has achieved a very high level of development a Technocratic system undergoes the *Diminishing Return* dynamic often seen in other Economic streams.  

But we can't get this mythical system for ourselves because there is basic and fundamental inherent feature in Democracy and that is that is is very hostile to Change, esp from inside. It actively resists (the System as a whole) change to any other form of system (be that good or bad).  
This is what makes Democracy so good and stable and also so dangerous that once a human group enters it, its pretty much stuck for a long time in it unless something happens from the outside which is even more rare in modern era.  

So we need to make do with what we have, unfortunately.

&gt;* With the shock retreat from public office of Reserve Bank of India chief comes the rise to international prominence of long-time nemesis Subramanian Swamy, a nationalist named to the upper house of parliament in April by the country's ruling party.

&gt;* Swamy, a Harvard-educated economist, has a track record of criticising Raghuram Rajan, whose decision on Saturday to step down as Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor when his term ends in September rattled government officials and foreign investors.

&gt;* The campaign gathered intensity since Swamy's promotion to the Rajya Sabha upper chamber, and his language has mirrored that of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the right-wing Hindu ideological parent of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

&gt;* That Rajan is now headed for the exit underlines both Swamy's mettle as a political antagonist and the balance Modi must strike between modernizing India's economy and appeasing his nationalist vote bank that leans towards protectionism.

&gt;* The RSS, an organisation that works mostly behind the scenes but which preaches self-sufficiency and is suspicious of foreign influence, has made no secret of its desire to unseat Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund now on leave from his professorship at the University of Chicago.

&gt;* In the reports of Neha Lalchandani, who covers the AAP for the Times of India and has been given a seat in the governing body of Gargi College, Kejriwal slams Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung or fires at them.

&gt;* In this 6 June debate on the Hindi news channel NDTV India, which was moderated by Ravish Kumar, one of the channels anchors, Dubey can be seen eagerly defending Kejriwal against the politicians Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan.

&gt;* The Twitter profile of Syed Fasil Ali, a group editor with Sahara News Network who is a member of the governing body to the Delhi College of Commerce and Arts, makes his stand on the partys politics clear.

&gt;* Pankaj Vohra, the managing editor of the weekly newspaper, the Sunday Guardian, sits on the governing body of Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies and has written sparsely on the AAP.

132,"&gt;One point is that Inflation is not always controlled by interest rates.

By using this argument, the author is making out as though that was Rajan's opinion. Rajan didn't want to lower the interest rates further because he was already sensing high inflation. 

&gt;So Swaami probably thinks that cases like this show that Rajan Bhai is wrong, inflation is not always dependent on Interest rates. 

No one says that this is the only factor. But it would be one of the many contributing factors. Also, if Swami had been civil enough to argue it out with Rajan most people would not have any problem. But guess that's too much to ask from BJP

&gt;Another thing is that these banks are like sons who have joined underworld. Parents do not kill the son because he has joined underworld. Say, these banks have paid 50000 Crores to Reliance, Adanis, Mallya and all. Say Nobody pays back. What next? All the bank managers can buy one kerchief each, go to Modi and cry for half an hour. What can Modi do?

Well Modi can stop being a mediator between corporate and banks.  He can divest the PSUs. And above all, he can stop accepting gifts from corporate like helicopter rides during election campaigning. Without doing these, he can't cry foul that his hands are tied.",2016-06-21 10:44:33

134,"&gt;Rajan had begun to turn the heat on some of these powerful business houses, including the controversial Essar Group, Vedanta, Jindal Steel, Anil Ambani-led companies, Adani Group, JP Associates, GMR, GVK, Lanco and Bhushan Steel. Many of these entities had already got their loans restructured – a euphemism for postponement of interest and principal repayment  
  
  
&gt;In the past, Essar, politically connected to both national parties, never felt compelled to sell its assets to pay back loans. In 1999-2000, at the peak of the downcycle in business after the Asian financial crises, Essar had nearly defaulted on its debt obligations. But it managed to retain all its assets and ride through the downcycle, of course with some help from the banks and their political masters. This does not seem to be happening now as, under Rajan’s supervision, the PSU banks have been quite emboldened and have refused to even meet some of these promoters to negotiate deals. Modi has supported this upto a point. But when the pain exceeds a certain limit, these businesses begin to forcefully encash their IOUs for past political funding.  
  
  
&gt;When Rajan made a caustic remark against Vijay Mallya’s lavish display of wealth, some official ventriloquists in New Delhi tried to counter the RBI governor by saying personal lifestyle should not be dragged into business dealings. Last fortnight Rajan retorted that personal lifestyle must certainly be commented on if the promoter has given personal guarantees against the bank loans. The public has a claim on the promoter’s personal wealth in such situations.

Similarly auction of natural assets where the UPA and previous regimes exhibited the highest degree of Cronyism have been done in a highly transparent manner. 

&gt;Does it look like they care about inflation or filling the government treasury and fulfilling the demands of their cronies? You decide.

This makes zero sense - How does having a 'full govt treasury' benefit the ""cronies""? The govt took the call to reduce Fiscal Deficit and invest [in infrastructure](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/F9LQnIO4YlCWdDTQlDYg5J/Increased-focus-on-infra-in-two-years-of-NDA.html). The easier and more demagoguey decision would have been to simply lower oil prices at the retail level, but it would have been fiscally highly imprudent. 

I don't get this logic, when govts are populist and offer subsidies and sops, they get shit on. When govts take the hard call politically, they still get shit on.

Also, unless you consider state owned oil companies as ""cronies"" you are vastly mistaken as to who benefits from this move.

It will kill savers. Despite deposit rates falling much faster than borrowing rates bhakts keep ignoring the facts. And let's not forget that savings have fallen to a multi decade low.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: The pilgrimage city Varanasi,which is also PM Modis Lok Sabha constituency will soon be getting the second bullet train after the Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor will run from Delhi to Varanasi, a distance of 782 km, and could complete the journey in just two hours and 40 minutes.

&gt;* Though it will take time and efforts before the service rolls out, the Delhi-Varanasi stretch  part of the Delhi-Kolkata corridor  has been accorded topmost priority for the railways after the national transporter accelerated the Mumbai-Ahmedabad stretch by tying up funds with Japan and setting up of the High Speed Rail Corporation.

&gt;* Fast-tracking of the stretch seems to be part of the Modi regimes strategy to project a pro-development image ahead of UP polls.

&gt;* The possibility of operating doubledecker high speed trains on this section is also being explored by the consultant.

&gt;* Under the modified single brand FDI policy, companies using cutting edge technology will be exempted from meeting the local sourcing norm for first three years.

&gt;* After a proposal comes to the DIPP, it will have to be decided by the concerned administrative ministry on whether a technology is cutting edge.

&gt;* As regards Apple, henceforth department of information and DeITY would take a call on whether it is bringing in cutting edge technology.

&gt;* The foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) had earlier allowed Apple to set up single brand stores in India but it didnt exempt it from the 30 per cent local sourcing norm.

&gt; * The August 2015 Naga Peace Accord (subsequently rephrased as the Framework Accord), as well as the move towards a settlement between the NSCN-IM, the most powerful Naga insurgent faction, and the Modi government, have comprised an important starting point to the talks that have been dragging on since 1997, without any solution in sight.

&gt; * The accord indicates a serious paradigm shift from democracy to communist, fundamentalist rule, civil society leaders say.

&gt;* The Mysore University is now mulling to suspend Guru, who celebrated Mahishasur Martyrdom Day to pay tribute to the demon king slain by Goddess Durga.

&gt;* Honouring Mahishasur has been a divisive subject and Irani spoke against it at length during a parliamentary speech in the wake of Vemulas suicide.

&gt;* Professor C Basavaraju, the registrar, however, said the university syndicate met to decide on Guru on Tuesday but refused to divulge the details.

---

&gt;* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is emerging among the frontline candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party for the Presidential election due in July 2017, it is reliably learnt.

&gt;* Jaitley is perhaps eminently qualified to pull off a Pranab Mukherjee, considering the fact that he is the only minister in the Union Cabinet whom Modi regularly consults on political and administrative issues.

&gt;* For his part, Modi seems to have realised that he can't have everything as per his wishes as it's an open secret as to how much he is dependent on Jaitley and has always been loath to the idea of replacing him with someone else as finance minister.

&gt;* Joshi is known to be fairly close to influential sections within the RSS and just a few days ago shared the stage with Bhagwat at a function in the national capital.

&gt;* By doing so, Modi will get a chance of having another go at kickstarting the economy with a new finance minister at the helm, thus showing the world how serious he is in his efforts at economic and political reforms in tune with the international community's aspirations.

* Even though AYUSH as a department was started in 1995, many of the institutions that get their funding through AYUSH have existed since 1970s. They were obviously not running without funds for decades, were they?

Besides, what does any of this have to do with the point I was making? Why do I have to bring up the entire history of Ayush to argue that Modi govt hasn't increased the funding of Ayush as most people seem to believe?

&gt; to argue that Modi govt hasn't increased the funding of Ayush as most people seem to believe

There is a problem though. This gives an impression that there is no additional focus on AYUSH - there is. The overall health budget decreases while AYUSH takes that decrease in money. For me, that is the problem - it does not matter if the the increase is 5% or 1%. There is an additional push even when AYUSH does not utilize its funds.

&gt;so I don't know if salman khan thought of this but making rape jokes is for me an act of civil disobedience

&gt;**salman khan thought**

topkek.

With that out of my system I understand what you are trying to say. You are saying that the laws and the justice system is horribly skewed against men. Although I concur, you must understand that your society is heavily patriarchal and women rising to the same status as men is seen as a bad thing in most parts of the world, even the developed parts (for example, US, Japan, S. Korea) and not limited to developing countries. Additionally, marital rape is not considered as 'rape' and our kulcha warriors, even women, say that criminalizing marital rape is not possible in a country like India. Then there is the other side of the coin, the hardline Muslims who think polygamy and triple talaq is perfectly fine. I'm saying all to show women in our country and around most of the world do not get the same level of respect that men usually do today. You may come from a comparably well-off educated background and the women in our homes may not have to think about men beating, raping and divorcing them, but the truth is you are in the creamy layer of the country. Therefore, logically there exists the need for a counter-measure like women centric laws. Is there opportunity to misuse these laws? Of course. What I am asking you to do is not paint all women ""falsely claim rape"" just as feminazis shouldn't claim ""all men are rapists"". 

I am saying all of this because you think rape jokes are an act of civil disobedience, and it does nothing but belittle the struggles that rape survivors are going through and will be going through all throughout their life. 

And, it is of my opinion that people who have a mass appeal, like Salman Khan, or Modi, or Kejriwal, they should be very careful of what they say in public because people revere them as Gods or Prophets. Equating being tired to being raped is probably okay if you snicker to your friend but not okay when you broadcast it to masses of largely uneducated people.

---

&gt;* In highly dignified words, which fit his character, Raghuram Rajan has scotched all media hype and speculation and said that he would like to go back to academic work after September 4, when he retires as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

&gt;* A man of intellectual integrity and character, respected for his independence, Rajan differed from the mighty Wall Street in US supported by the then US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

&gt;* Rajan, who had spent his whole life after postgraduation in US, missed interior India like Ludhiana, Bhatala, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Baroda, Morvi or Coimbatore, Tirupur, Namakkal, Karur, Sivakasi down south where business entrepreneurship has grown as a communitarian movement, almost disconnected from the formal banking  read monetary  system.

&gt;* When the Modi government came it realised that it could not generate jobs unless it funded the 58 million unfunded unorganised businesses which needed a capital of Rs 12 lakh crore  of which just 4 per cent was provided by banks.

&gt;* But Rajan who, in trying to target bad loans, virtually destroyed the business appetite for credit, would not even allow government the flexibility of a higher fiscal deficit to energise the economy.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Five months after its launch by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the government's Startup India initiative is due for an overhaul to improve participation.

&gt; * The government recently held a review after fewer-than expected startups applied for recognition and only one made the final cut for the incentives that are available under the programme.Subsequently, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) chalked out a strategy to upgrade the action plan and get more enterprises to take part, said a senior official.

&gt; * This has been done after several companies complained of exorbitant charges for providing recommendation letters.DIPP is hoping that increased outreach programmes and the upcoming national startup festival in Hyderabad will draw the attention of the community to the programme.However, startups feel the government should only focus on scrapping regulations that are an irritant for businesses trying to get off the ground, often pushing them to leave India and set up shop elsewhere.

&gt; * To be sure, some of the government's initiatives have borne fruit.The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) has approved Rs 930 crore in disbursals from the Rs 2,000 crore fund-of-funds it launched in August to support venture capital funds for startups.The startup corpus of Rs 10,000 crore announced in the Startup India Action Plan is also expected to be put to use soon.

&gt; * Indicating that he was right in not cutting rates extensively, he said that the central bank doesnt focus only on inflation to the exclusion of growth.

---

&gt;* India has sent a letter of request (LoR) to the US seeking to purchase patrol drones for protection and vigilance of its maritime assets in the Indian Ocean, sources said.The letter of request (LoR) sent by New Delhi last week comes less than a fortnight after India was inducted into Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and recognised by the US as a ""major defence partner"" after the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama, earlier this month.This is part of Modi Government's effort to fast track its goal to secure the country's maritime assets particularly in the Indian Ocean and detect any untoward intrusion like Mumbai terrorist attack.The letter seeks purchase of state of the art multi mission maritime patrol Predator Guardian UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) from General Atomics, they said.It provides high altitude wide area and has long endurance maritime ISR capability which will help India to safeguard its maritime assets in the Indian Ocean, both east and west coast.Flying at an altitude of 50,000 feet these drones have the capacity to fly non-stop for more than 24 hours and monitor the movement of objects as small as a football, sources said.India had previously shown interest in purchasing these drones from the US, but the Obama administration was unable to process these request as India was not a member of MTCR.After India got the MTCR membership earlier this month, the US has started looking into the proposal and is believed to be moving ahead with the next phase of letter of acceptance.

&gt;* ""Earlier this month, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi affirmed their support for US-India cooperation in promoting maritime security,"" they said.The issue of drones was discussed by the Prime Minister with President Obama who gave a favourable response.Referring to the India-US joint statement on June 7 at the White House, the sources said the two leaders reiterated the importance they attach to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight and exploitation of resources as per international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and settlement of territorial disputes by peaceful means.It is estimated that India could be looking at over 250 UAV's over the next few years estimated at over USD 5 billion.

&gt;* ""Its Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) mode provides a quick and easy method for locating moving vehicles,"" Dr Lall, an aerospace scientist said.

&gt;* ""The radar's Maritime Wide Area Search (MWAS) mode provides the capability to complete a variety of maritime missions successfully, including coastal surveillance, long-range surveillance, small target detection, and search and rescue operations.

&gt; * Pakistan, meanwhile, has already claimed that it has ""successfully"" blocked India's bid to gain membership of the NSG.

&gt; * As India's dynamic diplomacy on the NSG issue underscores, Modi's style is already having a significant impact and will gradually end up overturning long-held shibboleths of the country's foreign policy.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves praise for making 130 countries perform yoga.

&gt;* Pakistan deserves a permanent Shavaasan (a yoga position that involves lying down like a corpse), the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana

&gt;* Though they did come together after the election, Sena has been reduced to a junior partner and has lost no opportunity to hit out at BJP leaders.

&gt;* Recently, Sena had been critical of Modis remarks abroad about India being plagued by corruption, saying they maligned the nations image, and questioned if scams in BJP-ruled Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat can be attributed to others.

Now,all of this gets repeated so many times daily in various news articles here. What is newsworthy here? This seems like an exercise in mental gymnastics.

&gt;* At their crucial 50-minute bilateral meeting in the Uzbek city of Tashkent, Mr Modi, while asking that China contribute to the emerging consensus in favour of India's admission to the NSG at Seoul, said that China should judge Indias case on its own merits.

&gt;* But Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain, in his separate meeting with the Chinese President, opposed Indias entry, saying any exception in granting membership to the NSG will disturb strategic stability in South Asia.

&gt;* He reportedly made a case for Pakistan to join the 48-member NSG.

&gt;* Perhaps in an indication of things to come, President Xi Jinping told his Pakistani counterpart that Pakistan and China are iron brothers and that both nations enjoy an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership.

&gt; * ""I think next week is the 95th birth anniversary of PV Narasimha Rao.

&gt; * It would be a fantastic gesture on the part of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi to announce 'Bharat Ratna' (to Rao),"" he said in reply to a query from audience during a panel discussion to mark the 25th anniversary of Rao becoming India's Prime Minister.Baru's new book ""1991-the year that changed India"" would be released next month.Baru hailed the contributions of Rao as the Prime Minister who initiated the economic reforms in the country and steered the country in difficult times.Former CBI director K Vijayarama Rao and Rao's grandson Subhash, a BJP leader, were the other panelists in the discussion held last night.Contrary to the ""popular perception"", Rao was elected as the Prime Minister by Congress MPs in 1991 and not nominated to the post, Baru said on the occasion.Dismissing the claims that Rao only ""implemented"" suggestions on the economic reforms programme, he said it was Rao who decided to implement the policies.

&gt; * It was Narasimha Rao who decided to implement those policies,"" Baru said.Subhash said a memorial for Rao is being built in New Delhi and that the governments of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have favoured conferring 'Bharat Ratna' on the former Prime Minister.

&gt; * China may have put a full stop to India's aspirations to becoming a serious power by effectively blocking its bid to join the world's exclusive nuclear club, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), but in the debris of self-examination that will now follow in Delhi, only one question remains to be seriously asked : Was it political hubris on the part of Narendra Modi's government that prevented it from seriously evaluating the ground beneath China's feet?The morning after the extraordinary session on Thursday night of the NSG plenary in Seoul, Korea, China's arms negotiator Wang Qun declared to the press, ""We don't back India or Pakistan until they follow the rules.

&gt; * In 2016, Xi Jinping turned down Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plea as well as ignored America's diplomatic initiatives on India's behalf.Some will argue that China's rejection of India's application was done on behalf of its ""all-weather friend and ally"" Pakistan (when leaders from China and Pakistan meet, they begin their conversations with the mantra, ""our friendship is higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas""), which had also applied to become a member of the NSG.Both China and Pakistan realized that the rest of the world would certainly not accept Pakistan's application, because of its inadequate non-proliferation record.

&gt; * Brazil is a card-carrying member of BRICS - the conglomeration of aspiring powers,Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - while New Zealand is a stated ally of the US.Perhaps the unkindest cut has come from Switzerland, which Modi visited only a few weeks ago, and whose President, Johann Schneider-Ammann, told the Prime Minister that Switzerland would support India's bid at the NSG.So the question is, did Narendra Modi's India indulge in some spectacular hubris by pitching for a seat on the NSG in the first place?

&gt; * If foreign policy is above partisan domestic politics, then the Prime Minister should have reached out to his predecessor, who in fact had wagered his own government at the time to raise India's nuclear profile - in China's face.Perhaps it is not kosher to slam Modi's breathless foreign policy manouevre at the NSG.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Centre has shot down the deputation request of forest service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi , whom Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wanted to be posted as OSD in his office, saying service rules bar such hiring.It said that Chaturvedi needs to first complete mandatory cooling-off period of three years before joining the Delhi government.Chaturvedi, a 2002 batch Indian Forest Service officer of Uttarakhand cadre, is working as Deputy Secretary in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

&gt; * He had last year sought inter-cadre deputation to Delhi government.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on February 16, last year written to Union Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Prakash Javadekar seeking services of Chaturvedi as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in his office.The Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) has declined the proposal for inter-cadre deputation of Chaturvedi from Uttarakhand cadre to the Government of National Capital territory of Delhi, an order issued recently by Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) said.The decision comes after an order by Central Administrative Tribunal on June 2 directing the ACC to decide within three weeks on the deputation of the officer.After his induction into the service, Chaturvedi was allocated Haryana cadre.

&gt; * The ACC had approved the inter-cadre transfer of Chaturvedi from Haryana to Uttarakhand in August 2015.However, in February this year, Uttarakhand government rejected a representation of Chaturvedi seeking a No-Objection Certificate for inter-cadre deputation stating ""if government of India grants waiver of cooling off condition, Uttarakhand has no-objection for inter-cadre deputation"".As per rules, an officer can get central deputation or inter-cadre deputation only after the concurrence from both the state government concerned (the cadre state of the officer) and the Centre.Further, an officer must serve three years cooling off period between the two central deputation tenure.

&gt; * Uttarakhand.The Ministry had further added that on account of the different socio-economic, political, cultural and geographical conditions from state to state, it was imperative for an officer to fully familiarise himself with the demand and constraints of his cadre in the formative stage of his career, in order to effectively meet the challenges of his cadre.In its recent communication dated June 16, the MoEFCC had said since the government of Uttarakhand has not accorded its consent, and the officer is required to complete the mandatory cooling-off in his cadre prior to consideration of his next deputation, the inter cadre deputation of Chaturvedi from Uttarakhand to Delhi government ""cannot be considered"".The ACC-led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its order issued on Tuesday declined the inter cadre deputation to Chaturvedi.

In the circle of people who I know who are ""happy/ok/cool"" with the Modi government don't give a damn about Modi or Jaitley or Irani or shit like that. They have 2 main and equal reasons for doing so: 

1. They want **Hindutva** (in terms of getting the temple built, UCC (less priority) and a stop to all the media attacks on Hindu public figures and the religion in general). They also want religious renaissance happening. Obviously, a government can't cause mass change in a religion on its own. They want the government to let an environment exist that is conducive to such changes.

2. The next reason was **economic development** and opportunities. They want India to modernize itself in terms of opportunities, infrastructure, etc. They don't want it to be in the ""We will *eventually* become a super power stage forever"". 

These people are quite large in number and are out there. They are not as vocal so people ignore their existence. It's the same in USA where people underestimated the number of people who agree with Trump. These people and their ideas may not make up randia, so I welcome the downvote brigade. 

The point is that only Swamy is the only visible leader in the BJP who is catering to these people. They form the core of the BJP voter base. These are the people who along with Modi's projection of ""focusing on economic development"" brought him to the forefront of the prime ministerial race.

Right now, people and the media like hitting on Swamy but he's playing the essential voter base - people who subscribe to the ideology of Hindutva, not the BJP as a party.

Earlier also when Arvind Kejriwal had called modi a coward and  psychopath for the cbi raid, people had started slandering Kejriwal. And then later the court had to slam CBI for it's raid. Criminal conspiracy case was slapped against Rajendra Kumar. And then they had nothing to show to the court.

And now to divert attention from the MM Khan murder case, they have filed case against an AAP MLA. All of it is just ""alleged"". 

A case of misbehaving with a woman was filed against him 2 days back(Wednesday). And police came to his house to arrest him. Then again they filed a case against him yesterday(Friday) for slapping a man. And then somehow they also swiftly got a court to issue a non-bailable warrant against him. 

 And he has been arrested under a non-bailable warrant. And they arrested him during a press conference with all the camera's rolling to make a scene. 

And he is the same guy who exposed BJP vice president Sher Singh Dadar  in a sting for offering him 4 crore to defect to BJP. 

Delhi police didn't arrest the BJP lawyer who beat up Kanhaiya despite having video evidence and the court directing them to do so. Then they will act according to BJP's wishes and arrest AAP MLA under non-bailable offense.

India needed to pull its own weight and in contrast to a near passive foreign-policy engagements during the UPA era, Modi has kept this on his top priority to raise India's international profile. I am not among Modi
s coterie of fanboys, but he has done some serious shit in foreign policy in these 2 years.

* India **did** pursue NSG members, other than China. That's why Modi visited Switzerland and Mexico days before the NSG plenum and got their approval. US took care of S.Korea. It was some serious effort right there, however far-fetched it might seemed. During the last 2 years, we saw heavy-weights like Canada, Kazakhstan and Australia come on board.

* Also, Indian military exercises with China(more specifically, Hand in Hand) have largely been military exercises mainly to counter insurgency and terrorism. Malabar exercises are naval in nature and Quadrilateral dialogue focuses on the regional security. These exercises also find mentions in the joint declarations as you might have noticed. Chinese editorials are filled with ""analyses"" of these. Contrary to your assertion, I would say the former are more of routine diplomatic exercises than the latter.

What power? The Delhi police in under the control of BJP. This is not the first time this is happening. CBI raids, police arresting AAP MLA's has happened before. 

The Delhi police didn't do anything to the BJP lawyers who beat up Kanhaiyah in the court. There was video evidence also. In this case all it takes is an FIR to get a non-bailable warrant issued against him and to get him arrested. 

The problem here is Delhi police under the control of BJP who is settling scores with AAP. What do you have to say about the CBI raid? The one where Arvind Kejriwal called Modi a coward and a psychopath? Or is that one also somehow the fault of AAP and Kejriwal has no right to complain about it?",2016-06-25 16:50:18
434,"&gt; If Indian media is creating a hype, you seem to be undermining this more than it deserves 

I am not undermining anything. I am listing what happened.  

It was brazenly obvious for all to see that this was hyped beyond scope by both the Govt and esp. the Media. The entire chronology over the last few months highlights that.   

And my reply to you was specific about ORF's points/analysis which weren't convincing.

&gt; US didn't give anything in writing to get India in the NSG or for that matter, any of the 4 such clubs. That's not how diplomacy works. It was a **formal assurance**,

Which is what was said by me. This is actually not how diplomacy happens.  
India delegated the workload of joining the NSG and before that the agreement with IAEA to the US. This is even in the 123 Agreement, where not 1 but 2 sub-points explicitly mention and call upon the US to join India in getting India through the negotiations.  
This is not normal because its redundant to be mentioned. There is no need for it to exist in the text of the Agreement but it was because India was adamant on it because it knew otherwise it won't get it done alone and it couldn't take US's word for it alone because that has no teeth.  

All Indian Govts are on balance good in foreign policy. Core Indian strategic policy hasn't changed. Modi or Not.  

&gt; India did pursue NSG members, other than China. That's why Modi visited Switzerland and Mexico days before the NSG plenum and got their approval.

Modi didn't visit the Swiss and Mexico just for NSG, there were other deals which were handled.  

And even if this is to be believed why not visit, Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand. Modi went on a 5 country visit and Austria isn't even that far from the Swiss.  

Hence a redundant point to be mentioned in this debate.  

India tried (correctly, as i already mentioned) but it tried by hyping this when the reality should have been low-key because it was blatantly obvious that without US support India lacks the global diplomatic leverage to pull of such a complex negotiation on its own.  

&gt; US took care of S.Korea.

Koreans are actually close to China as well and they need China on North Korea at the moment. But all this was not relevant because China wasn't relevant but India (both the Govt and the Media made it by hyping its role BEFORE it had gathered consensus among the rest).  

&gt; Also, Indian military exercises with China(more specifically, Hand in Hand) have largely been military exercises mainly to counter insurgency and terrorism. Malabar exercises are naval in nature and Quadrilateral dialogue focuses on the regional security.  

.. 

&gt; Contrary to your assertion, I would say the former are more of routine diplomatic exercises than the latter.

Its your comment which is contrary to your assertion, logically so in fact.  

India and China are first Land powers at the moment, their Naval and Air game is not at the level of the Americans and Russians.  
Additionally India has counter-terror operations as its priority more than it has Naval operations because of obvious reasons which is relevant to the country.  

All military exercises are important. I mentioned the number for QSD and China because its a fact to demonstrate the irrelevance of QSD.  
Its a project which is wished by Japan more than anybody. It will never achieve great significance because Japan's objectives constantly run into Indian strategic planning.  

  
&gt; See, not getting into NSG won't dent India's nuclear commerce in any significant way. We already have bilateral agreements with almost all nuclear nations to supply fuel and in some cases, technology too

Of course. This is something i and a few others have mentioned on this sub for months.  
NSG-waiver for India was the bigger deal, getting into NSG isn't that big of a deal.  

WHICH is precisely why what was said about hyping this is true.  
This wasn't even important and it was treated as if we are getting shot if we don't get in. It was ridiculous and the blame is on Govt first because that is where the media takes the cues from. Once the media saw Govt is in a public high profile mode instead of not speaking so publicly about it, the media as usual took over its ignorant narrative.  
Indian officials making public statements/sound-bites esp abroad was ridiculous. There was no need for that.

442,"No, I understand the political logic behind the push. I just think that since this is a twice-per-year opportunity, it would have been smarter to focus that political capital on more substantive stuff.

For instance, to prevent China to install artifical islands on the Scarborough Shoals, which would give them extreme military advantage in the SCS. India may not be next to the SCS, but look at all the moves China has done in India's neighbourhood, either with Pakistan, Nepal or Sri Lanka.

India has a chance to project power, and it can't do so alone, but it could push the U.S. to contain China more aggressively than it has so far in the SCS. The U.S. would resist but that is where Modi should have spent his political capital, and get other Asian countries like Vietnam/Philippines/Japan and even Indonesia to join him and pile on the pressure.

Once China builds islands there and there is no response, there is no return. 

The NSG is a twice-per-year opportunity unlike the Scarborough Shoals, so I just felt that is a bigger deal to focus on. The Chinese will likely aim for artifical islands in the wake of the upcoming Hague ruling and knowing that America can respond less in an election year, they will see their chance.

Instead India went all kamikaze on a non-issue and spent a lot of political capital, pissed off a lot of countries and achieved nothing.",2016-06-25 19:54:07

There *is* an urgency if India wants to join the NSG, since Modi wants to get it done before Obama leaves office.

Once Obama leaves office, Modi will have to start all over again, possibly with Hillary Clinton.

Comparing Narendra Modi to Indira Gandhi? What? How? Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister for about 17 years (1966 to 1984 with a brief hiatus between 1997 to 1980). Modi has been Prime Minister for just about 2 years. Indira Gandhi presided over decisions which echo till today: the 1971 war and creation of Bangladesh, the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty, the nationalisation of banks, the abolition of the privy purses, the Khalistan militancy, the Kashmir militancy being the most notable. What has Modi done to be able to be compared with her? Nothing yet.  
  
The comparison of Amit Shah with Sanjay Gandhi is similarly ill-judged. Sanjay Gandhi was responsible for the Emergency, unarguably the darkest chapter in the history of the republic since independence, the forced sterilization of people and many other such incidents which I am too lazy to dig out.  
  
The article is also factually incorrect: there have been three full-term Prime Ministers since Indira, not two.

If you read India After Gandhi, he is only unreserved in his praise of Nehru (which is rather deserved). I am not sure how you've read his works and come to the conclusion that he is Gandhi sycophant. He is not a fan of Hindutva, but that does not make him a fan of the Gandhi family. 

&gt;Comparing Narendra Modi to Indira Gandhi? What? How? 

Modi has been a CM for more than a decade. His authoritarian tendencies are not uncommon. 

&gt;The comparison of Amit Shah with Sanjay Gandhi is similarly ill-judged. 

Maybe, read the article? 

&gt;Like Sanjay Gandhi, among his partymen Amit Shah inspires both respect and fear - or perhaps, respect through fear. And this fear of the BJP president extends well beyond his party too. Sanjay Gandhi needed his mother to impose an Emergency before he could suppress and tame the press. Amit Shah can make influential sections of the media bend to his will even in our professedly democratic, post-Emergency times. One Mumbai newspaper sacked a widely-read columnist for daring to criticize Shah (the paper's proprietor has since become a Rajya Sabha MP, supported by the BJP). This has made other journalists prudent - consider thus the interview conducted by Arnab Goswami with Amit Shah before the Bihar elections, when an anchor who savages ordinary party spokesmen was tame, even obsequious, when confronted with the BJP president.

By the way, there's also this bit in the article:

&gt;Set against the Gujarat riots, which happened early in his tenure as chief minister, is Narendra Modi's later focus on increasing agricultural productivity and attracting industrial investment into his state. More recently, after he moved to New Delhi, Modi has restored respect to the office of prime minister, an office that had been so badly degraded during the 10 years of United Progressive Alliance rule.

Then he should compare him with other CMs. Not a PM. Or maybe V.P. Singh, or Deve Gowda.

Correct. They are quite common among almost all political leaders in the higher reaches of the Indian political establishment. Which just begs the question.  
  
&gt;Amit Shah can make influential sections of the media bend to his will even in our professedly democratic, post-Emergency times.

&gt;* Early this month, after a meeting between U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House, the U.S., in a joint statement, recognised India as a Major Defence Partner

&gt;* This is intended to solidify the India-specific forward leaning policies for approval that the [U.S.] President and [Defence] Secretary [Ashton] Carter...and our export control system have implemented in the last eight years, the official said.

&gt;* Under this recognition India would receive licence-free access to a wide range of dual-use technologies in conjunction with steps that New Delhi has committed to taking to advance its export control objectives.

&gt;* It was meant to recognise that although India will not be an alliance partner of the United States, the administration seeks to treat it as such for purposes of giving it access to advanced technologies of the kind that are reserved for close US allies, Mr. Tellis told PTI.

&gt;* It certainly captures what is emerging as a unique relationship, exhibited by programs such as the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative [DTTI] and the establishment of a dedicated India Rapid Reaction Cell inside the Pentagon.

This only shows that there is Chinese black money in Switzerland, just like there is Indian black money in Switzerland. How does this suggest that the Swiss are against India's entry because of China? 

&gt;&gt; Chinese influence in Turkey: http://www.turkeyanalyst.org/publications/turkey-analyst-articles/item/426-turkey-and-china-merging-realpolitik-with-idealism.html

Again, this does not show that Turkey is against India's entry because of China. Greece is member of the NSG that has supported India, yet there is also Chinese influence in Greece: 
http://councilforeuropeanstudies.org/critcom/the-chinese-presence-in-greece-facts-and-complexities/

You seem to believe that the 7 countries are against India's bid somehow due to China's pressure. You gave links that only show that China has commercial dealings with these countries, but how is that evidence to indicate arm-twisting by the Chinese on the NSG? In fact, China has commercial relationships with all 48 members in the NSG. Some, like Greece, have lots of Chinese investment, but still voted in our favor. How do you explain that?

If we believe China to be the main problem, we will then spend our efforts to win over China, ignoring the remaining 6 countries. Consequently, the next time the NSG meets, we will still be rejected by these 6 countries. 

This incorrect perception that a single country is arm-twisting others is one of the causes of failure this time. Modi followed the playbook of Manmohan Singh, and focused his efforts on winning over the Americans, thinking that somehow once America says OK, everything will be fine.

All that shit about the media fearing Shah is bs, the media is free to write whatever it wants and it does, case in point being this very same article.

The reason the comparison is asinine is that during her regime,,such an article wouldn't have made it to print, and those who wrote and published it would be in jail.
