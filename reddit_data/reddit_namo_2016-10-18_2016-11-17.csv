Or he is just trying to add secular votes!

**DrPravinTogadia:** This is wrong way to look at things. We are ONE &amp; the same. Nation needs him.

**yogesh:** JAI SHREE RAM..say this openly..EGO FROM BOTH SIDE HURTING HINDUS ONLY

**DrPravinTogadia:** Boss, Hindus know it. Relax. You will take time to understand strategy behind it. Let him add secular votes.

2,"I think they have thought it through while reducing the education and health budget which are important, I mean if they increased this budget it's not going to benefit the people as it should have due to corruption. Most of the resources goes unaccounted, files goes missing. Those are the issues that should be addressed along with others. 
I can clearly see the difference when NaMo was CM of Gujarat and what happened after he left. 
I can't see India changing rapidly but it is changing slowly....not just government have to get involved in this but we common people should involve too.
I want to follow in my father's footsteps who donate equipments to government hospital and benches and stuff in school in nearby villages. ",2016-10-21 05:47:42

9,"Yes. Tweeted to PMO, NaMo, and that Javedkar. 

At least Javedkar is pretty much aware of the situation. He tweeted a few days back that 100 crore has been allotted to the development the college and Omar Abdullah should help us to reopen the college. (This was after Omar tweeted to him that why did MHRD give both IIT and IIM to Jammu. )

I think this is the reason. If they shift NIT the Kashmiris will get more agitated. Also it will send out the message that situation is not normal in Kashmir, which is exactly the opposite of what these ministers want to get out in media.

Bhagat Singh was a communist, now very cleverly appropriated by the kulcha brigade.

Netaji probably would have been a bad news for independent India.

Sometimes I can't tell who is more retarded, RaGa or NaMo. 

Kejru is an insignificant player in Indian politics.

Mamata is the best terrible things to have happened to Bengal politics (we have only had a series of unfortunate/terrible events happen to us). Can't wait for BJP to come in and take the baton of best terrible thing from TMC. 

Adding /s beats the purpose. If you are not a chutiya and don't worry about up/downvotes, then be sarcastic and let people figure out if you were being sarcastic. Adding /s is like liking your own comment on FB.

26,If demonetization is really going to inconvenience common man then it is the BJP or Namo who will be the biggest loser's and they do know it.. If this activity is being done inspite of all this con's then there is some legitimate concern or intention behind it. Hater's are those from looter Khangress and it's allies or Money Launderer's or people who had faced real inconvenient.
