31,"It's completely natural for the media to compare authoritarian leaders with prominent authoritarian leaders in history. The differences in degrees is obvious, but that doesn't just completely invalidate the comparisons.

I've watched a lot of Caspianreport videos, and honestly they're not all that different from what the BBC says in their documentaries and analyses, or what any of the documentaries I listed say. Shirvan seems to focus on history and geopolitics, and tries to be somewhat neutral; that's all. This isn't the only correct way of looking at the world, obviously. I haven't watched the other talk you linked, but I'll take a look soon. However caspianreport doesn't really justify Russian aggression or Putinism in any way.

On the neutrality of Caspianreport, take a look at these videos he made recently: 

[Decline of Putin's Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT4sK36cU3Y)

[Unrest in Kashmir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P_urGRxJ8M)


[Can India become a superpower?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXZ4pRhY-kU)

&gt;No sooner did I finish writing this, I stumbled upon this. Lol.

Modi gets a lot of flak over what happened in Gujarat, and a lot of authors naturally compare him to Milosevic or other dictators. It's not really that far off from comparisons people make between Trump and other populist authoritarian leaders, or Islamists and the Nazis. I don't see the point in just dismissing these comparisons when people have justifiable reasons for making them.

&gt;the Russians clearly mention that a Ukraine under NATO would have made Russia indefensible. 

But that's the Russian version of events. They portray themselves as victims of NATO aggression. How has NATO actually been a threat to Russia ? But Russia has infringed on the sovereignty of other nations multiple times. Putin doesn't particularly care about these things.

&gt;just bald face lies or misleads by stating that Ukraine was not a member of NATO

It's not a lie though. Ukraine isn't a member of NATO. Now of course they would want to become a member, why wouldn't they ? Getting article 5 protection is something a lot of countries might want.

&gt;nation are just imperialistic, nationalist Nazis while they themselves are pure as snow.

Nobody is anywhere making the claim that the US is pure as snow. America has a lot of freedom given to media, and much of the information you get that's critical of the West is from America. With Russia there simply isn't freedom of media, and being excessively critical of the govt can get you killed.

&gt;snide accusations of how Putin is just a judo thug

I don't think that's what they tried at all. They were very respectful towards that approach to geopolitics. They did that in Maskirovka too - in fact quite a few western commenters in the podcast admired this russian strategy.

&gt;I advise that we study yoga then perhaps we would not be taken by surprise by Modi's next moves.

Judo and yoga aren't really comparable though. I think you're being unfairly dismissive of the BBC for whatever reason and not even giving them a chance. Maybe you have your own personal biases against them.",2016-12-17 11:29:52
32,"I think you have a conception of media that is very different from what the media is actually like in the West, and consequently how media is in most parts of the world.

I'd imagine you'd think newsreading like Doordarshan is ideal. The problem is that's simply not how media behaves nowadays. Newsreading itself has a lot of problems and is often just a govt mouthpiece (CCTV of china is this way too, much like how DD often is).

The Media has no compulsion whatsoever to reflect public opinion if the don't agree with it, and they have every right to present their own opinions.

&gt;These news sources are all on the fringe (sans BBC). When was the last time Vox or Slate or Vice got an interview or inside access from a leading Congressman or a President?

Vice regularly has interviews with US politicians. They've had a recent interview with Obama.

&gt;There's a very well known quid pro quo media houses have with the US government

Perhaps. The point is the western model (not just America) lends itself to a media that is a lot more free than India, Russia or China. 

&gt;Why exactly wouldn't Muslims support Modi at this point?

It's not necessarily Modi himself, but the hindutva organizations that lean towards the far-right that support the BJP. The Sangh Parivar is widely seen as anti-muslim, anti-christian, misogynistic, anti-left, anti-West and anti-intellectual. So anybody from these groups sympathizing with them strikes me as odd. The beef drama alone should be enough for muslims to think twice before supporting them. Which is the case actually most of the time. Muslims in India have always tended to support the most viable anti-BJP party, and with good reason.

&gt;In the US, I mean, for one NRIs are pretty socially conservative. 

Yep they are. African americans are quite socially conservative too, as are hispanics. Being a minority tends to override all that though, except for people who think they are somehow shielded from majoritarianism.

&gt;I don't really think you can even compare Muslims supporting BJP and NRIs supporting Republicans to Jews and women support Hitler and Salafists.

&gt;I don't think it's absurd a high income bunch of professionals want to support candidates who want to lower their taxes and make running their small businesses easier. 

It's not an equivalence of course; but the idea of a minority thinking that they are somehow shielded from toxic political forces is common. This is a very common delusion that goes back centuries. The Russian aristocracy going up to the Tsars had people who thought they would be somehow immune to the far-left.

&gt; I don't think it's absurd a high income bunch of professionals want to support candidates who want to lower their taxes and make running their small businesses easier. 

It's not absurd - it's just incredibly selfish. The world today promotes ruthless individualism so it's not too far fetched. However I do think only a minority of Indian-Americans feel this way.

____________________________________________________

Nearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow. Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills. But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reputation as a sound economic manager.

On Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that India’s two highest-denomination currency bills—1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupees—would immediately cease to be legal tender in most places. Holders have until the end of the year to deposit these bills into bank accounts. As replacements, the government has slowly rolled out a redesigned 500-rupee bill and a new 2,000-rupee bill.

The long-term effects of India’s demonetization gambit remain unclear, largely because no other major economy has attempted such an experiment except during a crisis. But with growth slowing and job losses rising, the short-term prognosis appears grim.

Instead of factory openings or large new investments, the images that tell India’s current economic story include snaking lines outside banks, distressed workers migrating back to their villages, and tax raids on jewelers and officials caught with hoards of allegedly illicit cash.

The policy’s shabby implementation—through an avalanche of amendments, rollbacks and patchwork fixes—undercuts Mr. Modi’s reputation for quiet efficiency. It also underscores his overreliance on India’s notoriously heavy-handed bureaucrats.

Demonetization has resurrected fears that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party takes policy advice from quacks. It damaged the credibility of India’s central bank. And it forced many of the country’s ostensibly right-of-center intellectuals to perform advanced mental gymnastics to defend the prime minister. Though a few economists have applauded Mr. Modi, the weight of informed opinion leans heavily against his decision.

Not surprisingly, shock waves from the announcement continue to crash through the economy. The Asian Development Bank cut its growth estimate for India for the financial year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.4%. JP Morgan expects growth to decline by half a percent to 6.7%.

Meanwhile, falling sales have begun to translate into layoffs spanning various sectors, including construction, textiles and jewelry. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates the transaction costs alone of swapping out an estimated 14.2 trillion rupees’ worth of currency to be 1.28 trillion rupees, or about $19 billion.

India’s economy will eventually recover from this self-inflicted wound, but there’s no question that demonetization has created doubts about Mr. Modi’s competence. The decision, reportedly hatched in secret with a coterie of trusted bureaucrats, showcases the prime minister’s faith in the command-and-control ethos of the civil service rather than in the “minimum government” he once promised.

It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of “swadeshi,” or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.

Already, a flurry of commentary by well-regarded Indian and global commentators has tarnished the prime minister’s image. The business journalist T.N. Ninan calls demonetization “a bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.” For Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma, Mr. Modi’s “clumsy exercise of state power” won’t achieve its ostensible aim—cracking down on so-called “black money” salted away by tax dodgers. Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India and former chief economist at the World Bank, calls the policy “poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market.”

To be sure, not everyone thinks demonetization is a disaster. Columbia University’s Jagdish Bhagwati calls it “a courageous and substantive economic reform” whose potential benefits include shrinking the shadow economy, hurting terrorists and counterfeiters, and expanding the tax base by digitizing many economic transactions.

Others argue that this is likely only the first of a series of reforms that will eventually simplify tax administration, root out corruption and make campaign finances more transparent. Some supporters view demonetization as a quick way to invigorate a sluggish banking sector with cheap funds.

Perhaps the optimists will be proved right, but at this point their gauzy hopes of future benefits must be weighed against the present pain. Even if demonetization ends up producing some gains, the question of whether it was worth its considerable costs will linger. Moreover, the simple fact that no credible expert suggested such a drastic policy before Mr. Modi announced it makes many arguments in its support look like belated apologia.

Two and a half years ago, based on his record as the business-friendly chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi stormed to national power as India’s great economic hope. At least for now, the demonetization debacle has shaken this assumption to its foundations.

  NEW DELHI: There will be no ""postmortem"" of businesses that go digital in the wake of the November 8 demonetisation decision+ as the government would like to encourage people to ""join the mainstream"", PM Modi said on Friday.  

 

  Addressing the BJP parliamentary party+ , Modi said he had instructed officials not to question a jump in turnover or an increase in the number of employees when a firm makes all its accounts transparent on a digital system.  

 

  ""There will be no comparison with the past. Officials will not say 'take out the old (accounts)'. I have told them no old postmortem, otherwise no one will come into the mainstream... Yeh afsarshahi (bureaucratic way) nahin chalegi,"" Modi said, referring to his instructions to the labour ministry . In a bid to showcase the benefits of demonetisation, the PM said he could envisage a time when a small trader with a digital record of income could access a loan in six minutes. ""Now, no bank will give a loan to a dhobi as he has no record of income. If he does, he will get a loan quickly,"" he said.  

 

  The PM sought to counter allegations that he had acted in a knee-jerk manner, saying his project was nothing less than changing a way of life and an economic system.""There is a full scale design but the cards will be revealed slowly. I want to remind you that between February and October, we took 23 important decisions,"" he said.  

 

  In an unusual move, the speech was telecast on major networks after it was delivered by the PM on Friday morning. There were reports that the speech was to be broadcast live but a recording was shown later.  

 

  The PM also used his address to accuse Congress of avoiding demonetisation when in office, fearing an impact on its electoral fortunes.He quoted a book by former home secretary Madhav Godbole to say that Indira Gandhi shot down a proposal by Y B Chavan to demonetise currency with the remark, ""Does not Congress have to contest elections in future?"" Modi also responded to Manmohan Singh's criticism, saying the former PM advocated strong measures against corruption and black money but did ""nothing"" when he was in office for 10 years.  

 

  ""For Congress, it was a case of putting the party before the country , this is not the case with us,"" he said.  

 

  Modi also quoted communist veterans like Jyotirmoy Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet to argue that CPM had lost its ideological moorings. ""Jyotirmoy Basu had said in Parliament that Indira Gandhi survives on black money , her politics survives on black money,"" the PM said, adding that Left's alliance with Congress went beyond any poll pact.  

 

  The PM said earlier, the opposition used to come together to protest against scams and corruption. He said this was the first time that the treasury bench took a step against corruption and black money and people in the opposition had come together to support the dishonest. "" Aaj udhar kyun aisa kar rahe hain is ke liye bahut jyada dimaag khapane ki zaroorat nahin hain. (There is no need to think too much on why it (Congress) is behaving the way it is),"" Modi said.

Use the opposition.


Under this government we have the luxury of having a loud mouthed opposition which makes lot of noise, all the time.

The opposition is desperate to be heard with some signal(not noise), they will use your case ""common man suffering"" and make this case famous.

&gt;But they didn't do anything. They shut their doors and followed the news while we're being massacred on the bloody streets. Being pulled out of our houses. Our daughter and wives being raped. They were not there to oppose that. 

Huh? There are well documented cases of many Hindus protecting Sikhs from the rampaging rioters. Plus, no one wants to stand in front of a menacing mob. Majority of the population of any religion will just turn a blind eye to it. It's not limited to Hindus only. People look after their own family first. I'm not justifying the act though. Just saying that people want to avoid conflict especially against a violent crowd.


&gt;But the silent majority was the problem. They just kept quiet while Sikhs got slaughtered. 

Like I said, majority of the population consisted of poor or middle class households who had their own families. Majority of the population didn't help other simply due to the fear of repercussions from the rioters. It wasn't out of some malice.

40,"&gt;Modi had the gall to go after poor and informal workers.

You are talking as if this is the target rather than the collateral. 

&gt;He is doing no reform at all at the root causes of black money, instead ineptly going after the informal economy where most Indians are employed and almost all are paid in cash and spend in cash.

Informal economy is also why there is issue of taxes. Informal economy is also a problem, certainly not as important as the black money. There needs to be complete overhaul of the political system as in the party affiliation should be discouraged over affiliation to the constituency. Role of party in Parliament should only be for identification rather than the whole role. The govt should be the whole elected house, rather than the faction with the highest seat share. 

Political parties control legislature, expecting them to cut its own foot is dreaming. If some one is willing to do it then I offer my thanks. Look at the RTI on political parties even CPI-M is against it, do you think any party is supporting it. There are concerns but they are running away from the problem to save themselves. It is quite similar to the demand to rollback demonetization or rollback laws that I don't like. Rather than trying to fix the laws, lets just go back to those that don't work.

You are assuming that Rahul Gandhi will become the PM if congress wins. It's a big assumption and it's unsubstantiated. 

Modi can't hire qualified people and even when qualified people do work for him, he converts them in to a mere rubber stamp. In BJP camp all glories belong to Modi. Why then waste your talent working for a thankless government. Just look at Shushma, Rajnath or even Jaitely. They look more like powerless class monitor than veteran leaders. Ujit Patel is a mere rubber stamp and NITI Ayog a salesman. No wonder his digital India has not been able to add even 1MBps to current speed.

44,"In 2014, Congress lost its foothold to the competition everywhere. Same will happen to BJP. I won't feel sorry for Congress if more progressive parties feed off from Congress. Rahul Gandhi is no Yechury, Kejriwal or Mayawati.

 Congress got 19% vote share in 2014 and probably it willl stay thereabouts. The only good and sensible thing Congress can do is an alliance of UPA1 mold but conceding greater share of power to other parties in the alliance. They say that until Left was a part of UPA1, the governance was really good. They acted as checks and balances to Congress. Congress did not need them badly and didn't heed, Left left, corruption skyrocketed, then global recession came, and 2014 happened.

2014 was really unfair to BSP, they got zero seats despite 4% vote share. Also CPM is finally realizing that they should stand up for Dailts, so they are getting stronger. I hope these two parties join hands together as a strong alternative against rampant economic and social inequality. 

AAP is the real wild card, they can win coming Punjab elections. To do damage to BJP in 2019, they don't need to win tens of seats. Kejriwal just needs to win against Modi in Varanasi, that will a killer blow. AAP again seems closer to CPM in terms of the issues they fight against. 

But RSS might even ditch Modi in 2019. I read somewhere that one of the reasons BJP lost in 2004 was because RSS did not do the ground game since they felt Vajpayee was steering BJP away from RSS. If they don't work their asses off, no way can BJP win again. They can fool the urban middle and lower middle class again but not the rural poor. The reason they won so heavily in UP was through the Hindutva card more than the development card. 

In fact, the ""semifinals"" in the form of elections in Gujarat, Rajasthan &amp;  MP might hive very strong indications about fate of Modi &amp; BJP. He already tasted nasty defeat in Delhi, another defeat in Bihar and couldn't make any inroads into WB.

He cannot make it outside Parliament because then he opens himself up for a defamation suit, where the onus of proof is on him.

Apart from that, your main points.

All true. There is no strong rival for BJP. There is no modern, secular party on the Left or the Right.

Because I don't see anyone else having a track record of saying/doing things mostly sensible over the last few years. All those other people like mayawati, nitish, shivraj, etc have too much of a track record of making and saying stupid shit all the time. 

Let's start with **Shashi Tharoor**

* Has a history of saying sensible things. His criticism of the govt make sense, and whenever required, he has defended the govt (and modi personally) too. He seems to use his head and be sensible, sometimes even to the chagrin of his own party.
* Attained PhD at the age of 22. 
* Served almost 3 decades (29 years) at the United Nations. 
* Became under-secretary general in the UN. 
* [Almost became secretery general of the UN](http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/cover-story/the-inside-story-of-how-i-lost-the-race-for-the-un-secretary-generals-job-in-2006-shashi-tharoor) (Beat by Ban kee Moon, the present one)
* Amazing author and has a good sense of indian history and literature.
* One of the few congress people who actually won an election in the last lok sabha polls. People in his state like him a lot. 
* He seems to be a guy that people in other parties also respect and who could listen and work well with the opposition. 
* Probably the best PM candidate in terms of foreign relations and diplomacy. Will probably listen to experts in their respective field in terms of economics etc.


Let's look at **Dr. Jayprakash Narayan**

* One of the most sensible people in indian politics. 
* He seems to be very pro [education and healthcare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zxPJs6R2z8). We need a better strategy for it than one we have right now, and I think he will be one the best people for it.
* He's a former doctor himself, so has qualifications and supposed intent to look into doing a good job in the above. 
* People across party lines respect him. 
* Former IAS too, and has understanding of the beourocratic system first hand. 
* If given the chance, I think he could do a good job implementing reforms and streamlining things while improving his key focus areas of education and healthcare. 

as for **Chandra Babu Naidu**

* One of the main people involved for bringing the IT revolution to Hyderabad. 
* Seems to be a capable administrator. 
* At 28, he was the youngest minister in the state's history. 
* Longest serving CM of the state. 
* Modi was elected (at least partially) for his work as CM of Gujrat. I think what CBN has achieved for AP is far more impressive. So if modi can be given a chance, then CBN deserves it too. 

Some more people that I think might be good. 

One more could be **Jairam Ramesh**

* Graduated IIT-Bombay, Master from Carnegie-Mellon and PhD from MIT. Founding member for Indian School of Business.  
* Seems to make sensible statements and has [by and large done good work](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/13/jairam-ramesh-india-environment-ministry). Multiple stints of having cabinet portfolios. 
* Seems to have cross party respect. Could work well with opposition.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai police have found that the Rs 10.2 crore cash seized by them late Thursday night in the eastern Mumbai suburb of Tilaknagar belongs to a bank founded by the late BJP leader Gopinath Munde where his daughter BJP MP Pritam Munde is one of the directors.

Deputy commissioner of police Shahaji Umap said the cash belonged to the Vaidyanath Urban Co-operative Bank. The manager and two staffers of the bank's Pimpri-Chinchwad branch were transporting the cash from Ghatkopar to Pune. The seizure included Rs 10 lakh in new Rs 2,000 notes and the rest in withdrawn currency.

Pritam Munde said seized cash was not unaccounted money.""The cash was being taken from one branch to another. I was told that all the accounting details regarding the cash were there in the vehicle from which the cash was seized,"" she told New Indian Express.

However, sources said the three bank officials present in the vehicle told Income-Tax officials that the money was part of a total of Rs 25 crore being transferred but could not give an explanation about the rest of the money. However, the three staffers were released by the police.

This was the biggest haul of cash by the Mumbai police since November 8 when the Union government withdrew Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes from the market.

In two more cases reported from Maharashtra, Rs 1.6 crore was seized from three merchants and a Shiv Sena corporator in Kalyan and Nalasopara in Thane district in the past 24 hours. The Shiv Sena corporator from Nalasopara, Dhananjay Gawade, was detained for carrying new notes of Rs 500 and Rs 2000 denomination worth Rs 40 lakh and over Rs 1 crore in old notes. In Kalyan, police recovered Rs 21.22 lakh from two people identified as Mayur Thakkar, a milk businessman, and Tushar Manek, a garment merchant.

  NEW DELHI: Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today likened demonetisation woes to ""labour pain"", saying its end result would be as ""joyful"" as the birth of a baby.  

 

  Prasad made the remarks at an event organised by the Delhi BJP's IT cell that lay emphasis on how demonetisation was an opportunity for the country's transition towards a cashless economy.  

 

  However, Prasad said the government's motive behind demonetisation was ""less cash"", not cashless. He criticised the Opposition parties for ""not allowing"" the Parliament to function.  

 

  ""People will face a little problem. But the pain is like the one that a woman in labour undergoes. Eventually one will experience the joy like one does hearing the first cry of a baby,"" Prasad said.  

 

  He asserted that the defunct notes deposited in the banks will be scrutinised and not all of it will be considered ""white"".  

 

  At the gathering, largely consisting of lawyers, Prasad also took jibes at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying, he was ""happy"" when Singh spoke.  

 

  ""I eagerly wait for the speeches of two people. Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi,"" he said, and went on to hail Prime Minister Narendra Modi for having ""raised"" India's stature in the global community through his foreign trips.  

 

  He said the amount deposited in the banks will help in investing in strengthening the Indian Army, assisting farmers, small traders, building roads, adding that ""naxals and terrorists"" are a troubled lot due to the decision.

Are you freaking kidding me ? This guy is an ultra-socialist who keeps hating the rich elites, spends his budgets on socialist schemes, wants to make private industry suffer with more regulations and bureaucracy (eg. Surge pricing by Uber, Ola). Not to mention the fact he doesn't do infrastructure projects like building new roads, bridges. He's the last thing India needs. We already suffer with poor economic growth because of the leftist governments. Now you want an even more Socialist person as PM.

Now let me come to SAD. It was more than obvious that akalis will loose this election because of Majithia and Sukhbir's endless corruption. AAP was the big choice, but the party made huge blunders down the road.
Now akalis has been on a spending spree, building roads and completing project just to ensure that the anger of people eases up a bit.

Congress on the other hand has played a masterstroke. Nobody was thinking of congress as an alternative. AAP had taken the place of Congress. But with incumbency and corruption charges against Akalis; AAP party in shambles and inner bickering, Captain has come out big time.

He has taken the online route, trying to win over the youth. Nowadays, in Punjab if you go and visit any website, it has a google add running Captain's image. You see him everywhere. It is like he is playing the same game Narendra Modi played in 2014.

78,"An angle that I haven't come across in this debate is partly related to this ""amnesty"". 

Some context first: There is a story in Hindu mythology of a person called Ajamila who lives a life of full ""sin"", but names his son Narayana and on his deathbed, calls out his name asking for water. Since the last word on his lips was Vishnu's, his dutas (messengers) come too along with the Yamadutas. After an argument, it's decided that his chant of God's name purified him of his sins and he is taken to heaven.

Similarly, I suspect some of the vocal support Modi had from middle and upper class (I've literally heard someone say ""I had x lakhs in black, etc etc but Modi is a great man, his plan is great"" - it could have been in the sense of ""Yet Brutus is a good man"" too btw, I don't know) is due to this opportunity he gave for ""purification"" of past sins. By being vocally supportive, they think they can now be rid of the cognitive dissonance they were living under. The previous IDS schemes gave that opportunity too, but that wouldn't have been public. This is the mass-market version of giving gold ornaments to a temple and having one's name inscribed at the door.

  NEW DELHI: Lamenting the lack of training infrastructure, Union Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Pratap Rudy on Saturday said without a skilled workforce, Make in India will not happen.  

 

  ""We have 14 lakh painters but we don't have a single formal training centre for them. Similar is the case with plumbers, carpenters, masons etc. The ecosystem that has developed over the last 68 years needs structural change which we are struggling to do,"" Rudy said at a Ficci event here.  

 

  ""It is important for Make in India to happen but it will not happen unless we have the makers,"" said Rudy harping on the need for creating infrastructure for skilling the workforce.  

 

  ""The problem lies in the ecosystem that has developed over the last seven decades,"" he said, adding that certification was essential for establishing appropriate labour market linkages and ascertaining that the workforce is industry ready.  

 

  He also stressed on the importance of English as a language in the era of globalisation.  

 

  ""A student who doesn't have a formal education for 10 years and speaks good English has a 40 per cent more employability than graduates and post graduates in this country,"" he said.  

 

  Enumerating the various initiatives of the Narendra Modi government to skill the workforce, Rudy emphasised the need for apprenticeship for the trainees.  

 

  ""Training has to move out from the classrooms. Until there is apprenticeship, unless it is at the industry floor, training will not be complete. That is why we have come up with a scheme to promote apprenticeship,"" said Rudy, referring to the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS).  

 

  Launched in August, NAPS aims to increase the engagement of apprentices from the present 2.3 lakh to 50 lakh cumulatively by 2020.  

 

  ""Let us pick those things which are in demand not just nationally but internationally. Make yourself a good driver, plumber or an electrician and it can open many avenues including to foreign shores. That is what people in Kerala have done through nursing. This has changed the whole economy of Kerala,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Congress Vice-PresidentRahul Gandhitoday called thedevaluation of the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes+a 'Modi-made disaster,' just a day after he likened the currency ban to a 'firebombing' on honest Indians.



""Just how we say 'man-made disaster' in English, demonetisation is a Modi-made disaster,"" Rahul told a rally in Belgaum in Goa, where Assembly polls will be held next year.



He accused PM Modi of being the first Prime Minister in the history of the country to attack the poor.



""For the first time in the history of India, Prime Minister has attacked the poor people of this country. Usually the Prime Minister works for the country. They work for the economy, butNarendra Modihas attacked our economic system,"" Rahul said.



Rahul squarely blamed PM Modi for the hardships people faced after demonetisation. He claimed that a 100 people had died, and said the PM was responsible for their deaths.



""Fidel Castro (Cuban revolutionary) was remembered in the Parliament and we stood in silence for two minutes as a mark of respect to him, but BJP leaders did not have two minutes time for these hundred people,"" he said.



""Who is responsible for their deaths? Narendra Modi is responsible....In the last two and half years Narendra Modi government has been attacking the poor,"" he added.



Yesterday, Rahul had said at a rally that one per cent of the population had acquired the lion's share of the country's wealth in the last two and a half years, and that 99 per cent of Indians were honest. He touched on those same themes today, and even pledged to remove the Modi government - which he said was for the one percent of rich Indians - from Delhi.



""In the last two and half years, one per cent super rich in this country have amassed 70 per cent of India's wealth and if you look deep into this one per cent, only 50 families have (the) major portion of India's wealth.""



""You know their names; these are the people who travel with Narendra Modi to America, Japan, and Australia,"" Rahul said.



""Congress wants to get rid of corruption from India, and whatever step the BJP government takes - whether it is big or small - if it is against corruption we will give it full support,"" he said.



Asserting that demonetization was not against the rich but against the poor, middle class, farmers, labourers and small traders, Rahul repeated what he'd said yesterday about black money in India: ""All black money is not cash, and all cash is not black money.""



""Who has black money, it is with those 50 families, and it is with one per cent super rich in this country..,"" he said.



""...All the black money is not in cash, India's thieves are clever, and as soon as they get money they invest it in land, real estate, gold or in foreign bank accounts like Swiss bank.""



According to government figures, he said six per cent of black money is in cash, 94 per cent in real estate, big buildings and in foreign bank accounts.



Rahul claimed that the Swiss government had given the Indian government a list of Swiss bank account holders, and said the Congress had been asking the government to table the names of ""these thieves"" in the Parliament for the last two and half years.



""Why is it not being tabled? Why is Modi protecting them?,"" he asked.



""Why are Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya sitting in London? Why are they not in India? Why didn't you get them back?""



""Vijay Mallya is India's thief. After demonetization why did you waive Rs 1200 crore loan of this man? Answer me why did you feed him a toffee of Rs 1200 crore?""



Rahul said PM Modi knows that most part of black money is in Swiss bank, real estate and in huge buildings, but that he didn't know ""for what reason instead of going after 94 per cent black money, he is after the six per cent. Instead of going after one per cent super rich he is behind 99 per cent.""



""He is not after thieves, but behind poor farmers, labourers,"" he said.



Rahul Gandhi's remarks came two days after he claimed he hadinformation on the PM's personal corruption+that would cause a ""political earthquake.""

NEW DELHI: Union Finance MinisterArun Jaitleytoday said political parties haven't been granted any exemptions afterdemonetisationand the introduction of the Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 2016, which came in force on December 15, 2016.



""Under Section 13A of IT Act 1961, Political parties have to submit audited accounts, income and expenditure details and balance sheets. Post demonetisation, no political party can accept donations in 500 and 1000 rupee notes since they were rendered illegal tenders. Any party doing so would be in violation of law.,"" Jaitley said in a statement.



""Just like anyone else, political parties can also deposit their cash held in the old currency in banks till the 30th of December provided they can satisfactorily explain the source of income and their books of accounts reflect the entries prior to 8 November, he explained.



""If there is any discrepancy in the books or records of political parties, they are as liable to be questioned by the Income Tax authorities as is anyone else. They enjoy no immunity whatsoever.""



The Finance Minister also had a message for the media.



""I implore all journalist friends to be fully outraged against any step of the Government, if it is not against corruption. But in equal measure, I would also implore them to do adequate research before jumping the gun,"" Jaitley explained.



He said income of, and donations made to political parties fall in the purview of Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1961, and there's no change in its provisions.



""In this era of instant outrage, a 35-year-old law is presented as a new law being passed by the NDA Government,"" he said.



Jaitley also asked other political parties to follow PM Narendra Modi's lead and ask their MPs and MLAs to submit bank account details from the period that followed the note ban.



""There is no question of sparing anyone, and the political class is no exception. In fact, PM Modi is setting a new example of propriety in public life, by asking all MPs &amp; MLAs of BJP to submit their bank account details post demonetisation. We would like to urge the other parties to do the same and prove their intentions against corruption.""



Jaitley's statement came on a day when the Central Board of Direct Taxes offered clarifications on reports that it can't scrutinise tax returns of political parties.



There areenough provisions in the Income Tax Act to scrutinise the accounts of the political parties+and these political parties are also subject to other provisions of Income -tax including filing of return,"" the CBDT said.



The exemption from Income-tax is given to only registered political parties subject to certain conditions , which are mentioned in Section 13A of I-T Act, which includes keeping and maintaining books of accounts and other documents as would enable the Assessing Officer to deduce its income therefrom.



""In respect of each voluntary contribution in excess of Rs 20,000, the political party will have tomaintain a record of such contributions+along with the name and address of such person who has made such contribution,"" the CBDT explained.



Further, the accounts of each political party are to be audited by a Chartered Accountant. Besides, political parties have to submit a report to the Election Commission about the donations received within the time frame prescribed.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday rejected media reports as ‘false and misleading’ on the income tax exemption to political parties. In a statement to the media, Jaitley said, “Political parties have not been granted any exemption or privilege, post demonetisation and introduction of Taxation Amendment Act, 2016. I reiterate that Govt has not made any change regarding the regime and has not contemplated on the same,” he said.

He further added: “In the last two and half years that this government has been in power, legal and taxation regime with regard to political parties remains what it existed for the last 15-20 years. In this era of instant outrage, a 35 year-old-law is presented as a new law being passed by the NDA Government. I implore all journalist friends to be fully outraged against any step of the Government, if it is not against corruption. But in equal measure, I would also implore them to do adequate research before jumping the gun.”

Jaitley categorically said there is no question of sparing anyone, and the political class is no exception. “In fact PM Modi is setting a new example of propriety in public life, by asking all MPs &amp; MLAs of BJP to submit their bank account details post demonetization. We would like to urge the other parties to do the same and prove their intentions against corruption,” he said.

Political parties enjoy no immunity whatsoever, said Jaitley, adding that “If there is any discrepancy in the books or records of political parties, they are as liable to be questioned by the Income Tax authorities as is anyone else. They enjoy no immunity whatsoever.”

The clarification from the finance minister comes a day after Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa had announced that political parties are exempted under Income Tax law to deposit old currency notes in their bank accounts. The decision effectively means that political parties will not come under any scrutiny for cash deposits in old currency notes into their accounts.

ALSO READ: Deposits in bank accounts of political parties exempt from scrutiny under IT law

“Tax exemption on deposits by political parties subject to individual donations not exceeding Rs 20,000 in cash and with proper receipt,” Lavasa had told reporters on Friday.

NEW DELHI: In a move that is bound to evoke criticism for junking the long-enshrined seniority principle in appointing service chiefs, the government on Saturday night appointed Lt-General Bipin Rawat as the next Army chief, superseding two Lt-Generals senior to him. he presentArmy chiefwill retire on to replace General Dalbir Singh Suhag on December 31.



But the government stuck to the seniority principle in appointment of the next IAF chief by announcing that Air Marshal Birendra Singh Dhanoa will replace Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha on December 31.



Lt-General Bipin Rawat (infantry), who took over as the Army vice-chief in September 2016, has been appointed the new chief of the 1.3-million force, bypassing Eastern Command chief Lt-Gen Praveen Bakshi (armoured corps) and Southern Army Command chief Lt-Gen P M Hariz (mechanised infantry).



While Lt-Gen Bakshi was commissioned in December 1977, Lt-Gen Hariz was commissioned in June 1978. Lt-Gen Rawat, in turn, was commissioned into the Fifth battalion of the 11 Gorkha Rifles in December 1978.



Even though it's well within the right of a government to appoint whoever it wants to be the next chief of the Army, IAF or Navy, successive dispensations have almost always followed the seniority principle to appoint the new military chief. Exceptions have been few and far between, like when Indira Gandhi superseded Lt-Gen S K Sinha to appoint Gen A S Vaidya as the Army chief in 1983. Similarly, Air Chief Marshal S K Mehra became IAF chief by superseding Air Marshal M M Singh in 1988.Lt-Gen Sinha, of course, quietly resigned but went on to later become governor of both Assam and J&amp;K;, and also served as India's ambassador abroad.All eyes are now on Lt-Gens Bakshi and Hariz to ascertain whether they will also quit to register their protest since serving under a junior is unacceptable in the extremely hierarchy-conscious force.



The Opposition immediately attacked the Modi-led government for ""further politicizing"" the armed forces, which are justifiably proud of their apolitical and secular credentials, after it first went to town over the ""surgical strikes"" against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.



But conversely, say some experts, military chiefs are meant to oversee the management of national security and strategy in tune with what has been decided by the top political executive. ""It's actually the ease of doing business. So, the political executive should have no constraints while choosing who it wants to be the next military chief, RBI governor or foreign secretary. That's does not mean that the ones overlooked are less competent,"" said a senior expert.



Added a top government official, ""There are seven Army commanders (of six regional and one training command) and a vice-chief, who are all of equal rank. Lt-Gen Rawat got the sword of honour at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun and has had over 10 years of hands-on counter-insurgency operations and Line of Control as well as commanded an infantry battalion along the Line of Actual control with China in 1986. He has been selected on grounds of both merit and suitability. Both Lt-Gens Bakshi and Hariz have had very limited operational experience in J&amp;K; and elsewhere "" Butr Congress leader Manish Tiwari, on his part, said: ""Why has seniority not been respected in the appointment of Army chief? Why have Lt-Gens Bakshi and Hariz been superseded, Mr PM? Why has third senior most officer, Lt-Gen Rawat, with due respects to his professionalism, superseded other two in a heirarichal force?""'



This was echoed by some other quarters. ""Should we leave it to our opportunistic and immature political leaders to play politics with top appointments in the armed forces. Next, we will have caste considerations being taken into account in the armed forces,"" said a retd Lt-General.



Apart from prominent examples like that of Lt-Gen Sinha , successive governments have stuck to the seniority principle. The current NDA government, for instance, appointed General Dalbir Singh Suhag as the next Army chief from July 2014 onwards soon after it came to office despite minister of state for external affairs Gen V K Singh (retd), the BJP Lok Sabha MP from Ghaziabad, actively gunning for him on all fronts.



Earlier, again on the seniority principle, Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major was appointed the IAF chief to replace Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi in April 2007 despite being a helicopter and not a fighter pilot. ACM Major became the first-ever helicopter pilot to take over the reins of IAF since it came into being in 1932.



The one recent supersession in the Navy was when Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha was superseded by Admiral Robin Dhowan to become Navy chief in April 2014 after the then chief Admiral D K Joshi resigned taking moral responsibility after a string of warship accidents.

Since day one, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has been promoting the dream of cashless society in India, urging the people to use mobile banking and e-commerce technology in their day-to-day life. That's an imminent future, but now a new question arises: how secure are e-wallets for the nation?

Since last 40 days, Paytm is making waves with its aggressive marketing strategies - by airing television commercials or by putting full-page advertisements (almost every day) in national newspapers. There is no denying of the fact that for such e-commerce companies, the demonetization-to-digitisation process has become an attractive business proposition.

Also Read: 9 simple reasons why India can't go cashless irrespective of whatever PM Modi says

In last two days, Paytm has made headlines for showing its weakest side of security compliance. On Thursday, thousands of customers all over India complained that Paytm servers were down for at least 1-2 hours, affecting transactions in large numbers.

Next day, in an official release, the company admitted that by saying, ""Paytm has identified about 48 fraudulent users in the physical goods marketplace business, who was trying to game the company's consumer friendly practices."" Paytm indicated that some users were misusing consumer-friendly return and refund policies.

However, Paytm also assured that its marketplace has robust risk management practices and regularly reports users who try to game the company's fair usage policies.

Why Paytm still need credentials?

Surprisingly, one of the complaints was none other than internet-guru and senior cybercrime expert, Vijay Mukhi. He made a complaint with India Today saying, ""Paytm for me was down for 90 minutes and for my wife 60 minutes. Lots of people faced the same problem on social media as well.""

He was quite critical on Paytm's services. ""I cannot trust Paytm because banking should be like electricity or water. It should work 24/7 without a glitch. The bigger problem was that inspite of filing a complaint, there was no response from Paytm."" He advocated that people should always carry cash as they cannot trust technology to be reliable.

Market analyst and vice president of Pratibhuti Viniyog Securities Ltd, Suniil Pachisia said, ""Initial reaction was very encouraging but once the number of users is increasing we have already come across the scam. Besides, there are full chance of misuse of data and and legal action will have to challenge in origin country.""

Pachisia believes that it is very unlikely to stop frauds through such applications, which will be used through our mobile phones. He said, ""Security breach is always going to happen and still we are way behind in the stopping of frauds happening in credit/debit and ATM cards.""

Even bankers are having their own fears. Meera Sanyal, former banker kept a point that United Payment Interface (UPI) launched by RBI itself, is more secure as it's based on the IMPS platform developed by RBI/NPCI and uses double factor authentication.

What are the major concerns?

In last few months, at least one dozen e-wallet entities have emerged to get the bigger cake of digital business. Some are: Paytm, PayUmoney, Mobikwik, Citrus Pay, SBI's Buddy, Vodafone's M-Paisa, Citi Masterpass, ICICI Bank's Pockets and SBI's Mobicash.

Experts argue why for paying Rs 10/20/50/100 rupees, people in India require Paytm and others. ""It shows inefficiency on part of RBI to put smaller currencies in system. It's like a person moving in open market with a self-signed cheque"", a market analyst said.

""Indian money is not safe anymore with chances of more frauds and hacking happening. Stopping these cybercrimes would be a tedious task for mobile operators. And what happened in case of mobile phone is lost"", Pachisia feared.

The ownership pattern could become another major issue for Paytm in bad times. World's largest e-commerce player and Chinese giant Alibaba is the single largest shareholder of Paytm.

Cyber Law &amp; Security Expert, Advocate Prashant Mali said, ""We have that slight risk of data exported to China about consumer spending and behaviour by Paytm, if China exerts pressure or threatens to pull out.""

Also Read: Know your e-wallets: Quick intro &amp; comparison of Paytm, Mobikwik, Freecharge and others

Banking expert V S Girish has a similar opinion. According to him, the money would remain safe with such companies, but not the data. ""It is the transaction history that is stored in the servers overseas. Money does not go out of India. The challenge is: will the Indian law enforcement agencies get access to the data?"", Girish noted.

What does Information Technology (IT) Act says?

When it comes to financial data, Indian IT Act 2000 has clearly mandated that any sensitive personal data of clients before sharing with a new legal entity requires permission of the client and this has to be done every time the data gets shared further.

""The ministry should behave as a regulator and implement these rules formulated in 2011. I think not sharing financial data with investors should be made a mandatory rider in India's FDI policy for such e-wallet companies too"", Mali added.

Mukhi advocated that rules should be simple in India, pointing out that, ""All e-wallets need to have their server and backup servers in India. We are going digital but the infrastructure to take care of digital does not exist. This includes relativity and security"", Mukhi said.

If experts are to be agreed with, e-wallets make money in two ways: one from transaction costs, and other called floating income. The money you put in your Paytm wallet stays in Paytm's bank account. The interest earned out of it constitutes the floating income.

""UPI is therefore a far better option for Indians wanting to transact digitally-zero transaction cost and you earn interest on your money rather than Paytm"", Sanyal said.

A detailed questionnaire sent by India Today to Paytm enquiring about their security wasn't replied by the company.

As of November 21, 2016 Paytm had registered 5 million new users and over 7 million transactions worth Rs 120 crore in a day. ""The company is currently doing more transactions than the combined average daily usage of Credit and Debit Cards in India,"" the company had recently claimed.

Also Read: Paytm lost over Rs 1500 crore in FY 16

Some tips for using e-wallets

Cyber Law &amp; Security Expert Prashant Mali advocated some guidelines for using digital payment systems. They are mentioned as below:

-- Keep up to Rs 2000 in your Paytm or any other mobile wallet. Its better keep money in two different wallets from two different companies.

-- Whenever you require money you can immediately transfer it from bank account into wallet and use it. The risk is less here.

-- Never store bank details in the wallet.

-- Your wallet is linked to your phone number. So someone can block your SIM, withdraw money after procuring the SIM on fake papers from another gallery. So once the mobile is seen to be blocked or gets lost, immediately call the wallet company (and your bank) to get your accounts blocked.

-- It is better to use different wallets than park all money with same wallet company and you can even use bank wallets to keep your data in relatively safer hands.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, holding him “responsible” for the “complete failure” in implementation of the demonetisation initiative and the “unprecedented rise” in terror attacks against armymen.

Watch What Else is Making News



Pawar’s attack against Modi, which comes a day after the month-long winter session of Parliament ended amid the storm over the demonetisation row. The Maratha leader had originally praised Modi for the decision on demonetisation. Also last month, Modi had publicly admired Pawar’s role as a mentor during his early days in politics at a function in Pawar’s bastion, Baramati.

On the demonetisation row, Pawar said, “While there is no doubt in my mind that the demonetisation of the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would have helped curb black money and boosted the economy, there has been a total operational failure of the government in implementing it, which has left the common man reeling and the economy in disarray.”

“The old saying that the operation was a success but the patient died sums up the Centre’s fiasco in the implementation of demonetisation,” he added.

“You (Modi) take such a major decision, but do not prepare for it. The government and those behind the move cannot simply wish away the responsibility of the pain and hardship people are facing due to the poor implementation,” said Pawar.

He also fired a barb at the Centre over unearthing of Rs 200 crore in new currency notes during raids on certain businessmen, hawala operators and politicians. “On the one hand, the common man is grappling to find cash to make ends meet while, on the other, the Income-Tax raids have caught some people with crores in new currency notes. The latter suggests someone in the official machinery had helped some take away crores in cash through the backdoor. The Centre is to be held responsible for this mess too.”

But Pawar’s sharpest attack against Modi was in the swipe he took against him over the unchecked terrorist attacks coming from Pakistan. “I’m concerned about national security. Our information is that between February 4 and December 9 this year, the country has braved 162 terror attacks. Of these, 104 attacks have been on the country’s security forces, which have seen 57 armymen martyred. Never has the country seen such a spike in attacks against armymen,” said Pawar.

The NCP chief said, “Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi had consistently counselled the then UPA government to ‘stop writing love letters to Pakistan’ and had used the 56-inch chest rhetoric. But national security has been under seige and no concrete action is being taken.”

When a reference was made to the surgical strike across the border in October, Pawar quipped, “You (Modi government) build such an environment around one strike, but fail to enact concrete steps to guard our borders.”

Pawar added that he was “not politicising” the national security issue and that the Opposition was willing to walk with the government in this regard. “But the terrorist attacks demand a firm response,” he said.

On demonetisation, Pawar claimed that the aftershocks of the poor implementation have already been felt in the economy. “The worst-hit is the farm sector and small-scale businesses. But the government does not seem to be taking the distress signs seriously. The construction sector too has been hit,” he said.

Dropping names of two manufacturing giants (names withheld), the NCP chief said the companies had begun laying off employees. “All this will lead to a rise in unemployment. But the government does not seem serious about it,” he said. Pawar also criticised the Modi government for curbs on transactions of district cooperative banks.

Demonetisation does send this into overdrive, as well as I am sure a million other channels for funneling money.

Belagavi:  A day after he met Prime Minister, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi again hit out at the latter for the  demonetisation of high value currency notes.



Mr Gandhi claimed that the prime minister had attacked the economic system of the country to benefit the one per cent ""super rich.""



""For the first time in the history of India, Prime Minister has attacked the poor people of this country. Usually the Prime Minister works for the country. They work for the economy, but Narendra Modi has attacked our economic system,"" Mr Gandhi alleged at a Congress rally in north Karnataka.



""As it is said a man-made disaster, in the same way demonetization is Modi-made disaster,"" the Congress Vice-President said as he targeted the Prime Minister squarely blaming him for the hardships post-demonetisation.



 More than 100 people had died, he claimed, adding, ""Fidel Castro (Cuban revolutionary) was remembered in the Parliament and we stood in silence for two minutes as a mark of respect to him, but BJP leaders did not have two minutes time for these hundred people.""



""Who is responsible for their deaths? Narendra Modi is responsible....In the last two and half years Narendra Modi government has been attacking the poor,"" he said.



Accusing the Modi government of trying to divide India, he said on the one side, there were one per cent super rich who have private aircraft, flashy vehicles and big businesses and on the other, there were 99 per cent of people who are honest like farmers, labourers, small traders and middle class who toil every day for the sake of the country and their lives.



""In the last two and half years, one per cent super rich in this country have amassed 70 per cent of India's wealth and if you look deep into this one per cent, only 50 families have major portion of India's wealth.""



""You know their names; these are the people who travel with Narendra Modi to America, Japan, and Australia,"" Mr Gandhi said.



""Congress wants to get rid of corruption from India and whatever step the BJP government takes whether it is big or small if it is against corruption we will give it full support,"" he said.



Asserting that demonetization was not against the rich but against the poor, middle class, farmers, labourers and small traders, Mr Gandhi said ""all black money is not cash, and all cash is not black money.""



""Who has black money, it is with those 50 families, and it is with one per cent super rich in this country..,"" he said.



""...All the black money is not in cash, India's thieves are clever, and as soon as they get money they invest it in land, real estate, gold or in foreign bank accounts like Swiss bank.""



According to government figures, he said six per cent of black money is in cash, 94 per cent in real estate, big buildings and in foreign bank accounts.



Claiming that the Swiss government had given a list of Swiss bank account holders' names to Indian government, he said the Congress had been asking the government to table the names of ""these thieves"" in the Parliament for the last two and half years.""Why is it not being tabled? Why is Modi protecting them?""



""Why are Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya sitting in London? Why are they not in India? Why didn't you get them back? Vijay Mallya is India's thief. After demonetization why did you waive Rs 1200 crore loan of this man? Answer me why did you feed him a toffee of Rs 1200 crore?""



Mr Gandhi said Mr Modi knows that most part of black money is in Swiss bank, real estate and in huge buildings, ""but I don't know for what reason instead of going after 94 per cent black money, he is after the six per cent. Instead of going after one per cent super rich he is behind 99 per cent.""



""He is not after thieves, but behind poor farmers, labourers,"" the Congress vice president said.

The opposition Congress party criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday over the appointment of new army chief Lt Gen Bipin Rawat, with the government overlooking a tradition of elevating senior-most officers as service chiefs.

The Congress asked why the Centre did not follow the seniority principle in appointing Lt Gen Rawat, the vice-chief in the army.

“Why has Seniority not been respected in Aptt.of Army Chief?Why have Lt Gen PRAVIN Bakshi &amp; Lt Gen Mohamed Ali Hariz been superseded Mr PM?” questioned former Union minister and Congress leader Manish Tewari on Twitter.

Eastern Army commander Lt Gen Praveen Bakshi is the senior-most official after incumbent army chief Gen Dalbir Singh, who retires on December 31. Southern Army commander Lt Gen PM Hariz is the next senior-most official.

Tewari claimed that Lt Gen Rawat is “not third but fourth senior most. Even Lt Gen BS Negi army commander Central Command is senior to him”.

Political parties have generally avoided commenting on internal matters of the armed forces, including key appointments. But the Congress, which has targeted PM Modi over the demonetisation exercise, upped the ante against the government with Tewari’s pointed questions.

The Left, too, questioned Rawat’s appointment. CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim said: “Generally, we never comment on issues related to the armed forces. But it seems that the government is trying to change the traditions and norms of India’s major institutions.”

There were early indications that the government might not follow established norms. The names of news chiefs are conventionally announced 2-3 months before an incumbent retires. But this time the next appointments have come barely a fortnight before the incumbents retire.

In early 1980s, Lt Gen SK Sinha was overlooked in the appointment of Gen AS Vaidya as the army chief.

Rawat will be the second consecutive chief from the Gorkha Rifles. He will succeed Gen Dalbir Singh who was commissioned into 4/5 Gorkha Rifles.

  MUMBAI: Anyone who's never had more than Rs 2 lakh in his or her bank account but does so now should be worried.  

 

  Such accounts will be red-flagged and invite scrutiny by RBI, which may report them to the income-tax department to be investigated for possibly suspicious transactions as the government gears up for the next phase of its anti-black money campaign.  

 

  The central bank has ordered banks to provide data on such accounts as it steps up efforts to ensure that the banking system is not misused to launder black money after the demonetisation drive that was announced on November 8, said people familiar with the matter.  

 

  This appears to be a lowering of the threshold for inquiry — banks are currently providing information to the Financial Intelligence Unit on accounts where customers have deposited Rs 2.5 lakh or more in cash. This comes as raids have uncovered bundles of currency stashed away in bank lockers or being transported across the country. Several bank employees, including one RBI official, have been suspended or sacked for unauthorised exchange of notes amid a currency shortage that has hit regular customers and hurt the economy.  

 

  The regulator has written to banks asking for details of accounts at specific branches, particularly those in tier-II and tier-III cities that have witnessed abnormal jumps in deposits.  

 

 

  

  “What RBI has now asked is far more difficult to compile. There are accounts which may see deposits and withdrawals and thus compiling those with balance of Rs 2 lakh would be time-consuming,” said one of the officials.  

 

  The government fears that dormant, benami and no-frills accounts are being used to park unaccounted money. The central bank and other agencies are intensifying efforts to ensure that black money supposed to have been rendered worthless by demonetisation doesn’t find its way back into the system.  

 

  Of the Rs 15.4 lakh crore of currency accounted for by the cancelled Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, Rs 12.44 lakh crore or 80% has been deposited.  

 

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the notes would cease to be legal tender on November 8. They can be deposited or swapped at bank counters until December 30.  

 

  The new threshold is being seen as a further tightening of the screw, a banker said.  

 

  “The government had in the past said that immunity would be given to those depositing up to Rs 2.5 lakh. Now RBI has asked information about deposits up to Rs 2 lakh,” he said. “This may send a signal that even those deposits of Rs 2 lakh will be under scrutiny.”  

 

  In an earlier letter, RBI had ordered banks to undertake internal audits at branches and currency chests where they spot unusual patterns in cash movement, a move that bankers said was aimed at preventing illegal note swaps.  

 

  In recent weeks, there has been a surge in money flowing into nofrills Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana accounts that were opened as part of the government’s financial inclusion drive.  

 

  Close to Rs 27,000 crore was deposited in Jan Dhan accounts within two weeks of demonetisation as against Rs 45,000 crore mobilised in two years prior to the scrapping of high-value notes.  

 

  That’s led to concerns that unaccounted money may be channelled through this route.  

 

  Newspaper advertisements issued by the income-tax department on Friday exhorted people not to “put other’s money in your bank accounts”. Earlier this week, an RBI official was suspended for allegedly seeking to exchange notes illegally.  

 

  Last week, Axis Bank suspended 24 officials after the I-T department raided the bank’s Chandni Chowk branch in Delhi that had opened 44 fake accounts holding Rs 100 crore. On Thursday, Axis Bank uncovered 20 fake accounts at its Noida branch holding Rs 60 crore.  

 

  About 27 state-run bank executives have either been suspended or transferred for unauthorised transactions. Early December, HDFC Bank sacked four employees in Chandigarh for the unauthorised exchange of notes.

151,"India’s “Lutyens Zone” (analogous to the “Washington Beltway”) went into overdrive from 16 May 2014 to ensure that Narendra Modi becomes a single-term Prime Minister or even be forced to quit his office in between, as took place during 1979 in the case of the other PM from Gujarat, Morarji Desai. This strategy cannot be dismissed as impossible to implement.

---

&gt; * Although Rahul Gandhi has often been dismissed as an intellectual lightweight by several of his peers, according to a credible strategist working in the interests of the Lutyens Zone, the fact is that the vice-president of the All India Congress Committee has been working to a plan to derail Modi from the start.

&gt; * Whether because of a continuation of the Vajpayee line (of backroom compromise with the Congress while verbal pyrotechnics abounded in public), or because (PM) Modi was advised by some key associates friendly to the Lutyens Zone that he should not appear vindictive, but statesmanlike, the NDA government has thus far done almost nothing to enforce accountability on those UPA-era central heavyweights perceived as having made billions through stock exchange frauds, foreign currency manipulations and through tweaks in government policy.

&gt; * Although it is impossible to verify whether Lutyens Zone moles were deliberately ensuring the sabotage through distortions in detail of Prime Minister Modis hugely consequential scheme, it seems clear that unpardonable errors have been made in both the conceptualisation as well as the operationalisation of the details of the swap of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, as well as in calculating its after-effects.

&gt; * More than any outside force, it is those on the inside who have the highest potential for inflicting damage on the Modi administration, and this may nowhere be clearer than in the manner in which the 8 November decision approved by Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi has been implemented thus far, although knowing his strong personality, Prime Minister Modi is likely to continue to stand by his entire team despite increasing political fallout from the manner in which his 8 November 2016 announcement has been tweaked and implemented.

The result would be to move more and more people to use their bank accounts. This is, by itself, not a bad thing. Danger is the huge risk of scams and cheating that would happen to people who are new to the banking system, online payments and so on.

The objective of the demonetisation exercise was never war on black money, counterfeiting, terrorism funding blocking etc. All that was the PR. The real objective was to bring more people into the banking system, and a fraction of them more into the tax net. Which will happen. For this to happen, cash has to be in 'relatively' limited supply compared to earlier.

Queues etc will vanish in max 3 months. (Too long perhaps). Higher transactions will happen digitally, smaller transactions by cash and a fraction of them digitally. Good enough for Modi and Jaitley.

That's because it isn't believable. That you swallow the conspiracy theory outright from the most powerful PM India has had in decades just goes to show that his brainwashing and propaganda works very effectively.

The idea was brilliant, he will claim, but he was undermined by Jaitley's bad implementation of it. Maybe Patel at the RBI can be made into a scapegoat, too, if there is a need for it. Just keep pushing the goalposts and shift them endlessly.

It won't matter that Jaitley was loyal as a submissive self-selected slave. Modi has shown that he has no compunctations about throwing people under the bus if it suits his agenda. Loyalty doesn't count for anything if betraying a loyal friend means you get political benefits.",2016-12-18 14:42:16

Applies to the departments I mentioned as well. If they had done their job well, none of this fuckery by Modi would be required. He could have very well targeted them and they would have spilled the beans on all the illegal transactions going on - easily netting him much higher BM than what is being netted now with the added benefit of not troubling the common man as well. - ie if Modi really wanted to curb BM, which was never his plan or idea though.

He is the face of the BJP and the BJP made him the defacto general. Just because we have no credible opposition doesn't mean that people will vote for him again. People want their businesses back. Anyone who can promise to give it to them will get their vote. They gave this man a chance and he has fucked the currency and the RBI in ways which cannot be reversed.

ideologue S on Monday said the newly issued Rs 2,000 currency note is a ""stopgap arrangement"" to tide over the after demonetisation, and it will ultimately be withdrawn by the government, albeit gradually.

Gurumurthy, who is said to be in the loop all through the process, said in an interview with India Today news channel that the Rs 2,000 note was introduced only to meet the demand-supply gap after Rs 500 and Rs 1, were sucked out of circulation.

He said the banks would be asked to hold back Rs 2, and replace them with lower denomination notes.

""Obviously, the banks will be told not to return Rs 2, they receive. Slowly, the banks will accumulate Rs 2, and replace them with lower denomination notes,"" said Gurumurthy, a prominent member of the RSS-backed think tank Vivekananda International Foundation.

He said the government would be phasing out Rs 2, and not demonetising them.

""We have phased out many series of notes like this in the past,"" he said.

said the government was committed towards lower denomination currency.

Gurumurthy's remarks came after the government's contradictory stand that it was demonetising Rs 1, since higher denomination currency encouraged black money, but instead introduced Rs 2,000 note.

Very simple. They were hoping old notes being deposited will result in 30% deficit which they can proudly claim as the Black Money! But their calculations just misfired and almost all of it is back now - leaving no BM! Now to save face the goalposts are being shifted - from one stadium in Delhi to a stadium in Chennai - which the people nor the opposition are just not ready to buy!

Modi could have apologized for this Tuglaqian blunder and concentrate on how BM can really be brought back. Instead his inflated ego can't accept it and he keeps dragging everyone under the sun all the way back to Indira Gandhi to justify his move.

To pull more wool over the common man, he's now turning to catch the little fry with the help of the IT dpt, ED, MoF etc 

He also knows the people's memories are short lived. Once he can conjure up an image of acting on the BM hoarders he thinks he can fight the elections by saying oh look how many people have been caught. But he can't fool the people so easily - if they know facts!

Yes it was never his plan or idea to curb BM. If you read my 3 part series (I linked 2nd part above) you'll find out more about it. Its backed with real accounts and facts. you can verify it yourself after reading it.

I'm not saying the money seized is not illegal. I'm saying those who are caught are the small 'fry'.

NEW DELHI: Union Finance MinisterArun Jaitleytoday said political parties haven't been granted any exemptions afterdemonetisationand the introduction of the Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 2016, which came in force on December 15, 2016.



""Under Section 13A of IT Act 1961, Political parties have to submit audited accounts, income and expenditure details and balance sheets. Post demonetisation, no political party can accept donations in 500 and 1000 rupee notes since they were rendered illegal tenders. Any party doing so would be in violation of law,"" Jaitley said in a statement.



""Just like anyone else, political parties can also deposit their cash held in the old currency in banks till the 30th of December provided they can satisfactorily explain the source of income and their books of accounts reflect the entries prior to 8 November"", he explained.



""If there is any discrepancy in the books or records of political parties, they are as liable to be questioned by the Income Tax authorities as is anyone else. They enjoy no immunity whatsoever.""



Under the Income Tax Act, income of political parties is exempt from tax subject to condition that all donations above Rs 20,000 are taken through cheques and smaller ones are properly documented with full details of donors. These accounts also have to be audited.



A message for the media



The Finance Minister today also had a message for the media.



""I implore all journalist friends to be fully outraged against any step of the Government, if it is not against corruption. But in equal measure, I would also implore them to do adequate research before jumping the gun,"" Jaitley explained in his statement.



He said income of, and donations made to political parties fall in the purview of Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1961, and there's no change in its provisions.



""In this era of instant outrage, a 35-year-old law is presented as a new law being passed by the NDA Government,"" he said.



Jaitley also asked other political parties to follow PM Narendra Modi's lead and ask their MPs and MLAs to submit bank account details from the period that followed the note ban.



""There is no question of sparing anyone, and the political class is no exception. In fact, PM Modi is setting a new example of propriety in public life, by asking all MPs &amp; MLAs of BJP to submit their bank account details post demonetisation. We would like to urge the other parties to do the same and prove their intentions against corruption.""



No changes in legal and taxation regimes for registered political parties



In Mumbai, Jaitley told reporters that ""the legal and taxation regimes for all registered political parties remain as they were 20-25 years ago. Our government has not made any changes to these rules, nor we are planning to make any"".



He warned political parties not to misuse the system. ""There is no relaxation in the tax scrutiny of political parties. This is a complete media creation. We will take strong action against those parties which misuse the system.""



Stating that no changes have been made in the law regarding political funding, he said, ""Not a single change has been made in the last two months or so, or in the last two-and-a-half years with regard to taxation of political parties.



""Nothing has been done, whatever was the existing system which has existed for the last 15 years is continuing and if somebody creates a political party for the purpose of channelising funds... obviously law will step in,"" Jaitley said.

&gt;* The Defence Ministry sources also asserted that selection of Army chief is the sole prerogative of the government and it is based purely on merit, irrespective of the Corps to which the officer originally belonged.

&gt;* ""Lt Gen Bipin Rawat fulfills this criteria by virtue of his operational assignments as Commanding Officer of 19 Division in Jammu and Kashmir and his outstanding track record, his familiarity with the functioning of the Army HQ and MoD in his capacity as Vice Chief and his general dynamism has also played a role in tipping the scales in his favour,"" the sources said.

&gt;* A political slugfest broke out over the new army chief's appointment with Congress and the Left asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spell out the ""compelling reasons"" for superseding the senior officers even as BJP hit back saying they should not politicise an issue related to defence forces.

&gt;* The Ministry maintained ""that the selection is based purely on merit, irrespective of the Corps to which the officer originally belonged"".

Traffickers usually peg the ‘cost’ of a woman or girl at Rs2.5 lakh, made up of the cost of transporting her and paying off local politicians and the ultimate cost of grooming her. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/Mint

New Delhi: Demonetisation has brought the trafficking of women and girls for sex work—a Rs20 trillion industry—to a grinding halt, studies and rescue workers said.

Rescue workers on the field said the process of trafficking of women is usually completed by November, after which trafficked women and girls are transported to various parts of the country to be sold to brothels, placement agencies and as child brides. With Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes withdrawn since the 8 November demonetisation announcement and new currency notes in short supply, the trade has hit a dead end, they said.

“Trafficking has stopped completely. Girls are usually trafficked from Guwahati in Assam and Jharkhand in the north and Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad in the south. Over the last one month, not a single girl has been trafficked. This is primarily because there is no liquidity left. All transactions used to happen in cash and now employers have no money to pay the middlemen. All the money that changed hands till now is useless,” said Rakesh Senger, a child rights activist with Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO.

In what is one of India’s biggest organized crime rackets, traffickers usually peg the “cost” of a woman or girl at Rs2.5 lakh, made up of the cost of transporting her, paying off local politicians, authorities and police officials and the ultimate cost of grooming her.

However, the actual cost incurred stands at around Rs20,000. The remaining Rs2.3 lakh is pocketed by the trafficker, rescue workers said.

A study by Global March against Child Labour, a network of trade unions, teachers and civil society organisations, pegs the annual figure in India at a little over Rs18.6 trillion.

The study said that there are multiple figures that are involved in the trade whose earnings have taken a hit—traffickers, brothel owners, money lenders, law enforcement officials,and members of the judiciary. “The movement of money is quick and creates a mirage for all players involved. Whenever possible individuals peripherally attached to the business, such as law enforcement, judiciary, doctors, and money lenders capitalize on the illegality of the trade.”

“A 10-12 year old girl costs Rs5 lakh, while girls between the groups of 13 and 15 cost Rs4 lakh. These transactions are all done in cash, in black money. The brothel owners are now caught in a bind because they can’t convert this cash at the banks. Because the new currency is not readily available, clients have stopped going to brothels and the brothel owners have no money to pay the traffickers,” Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi said.

ALSO READ | Modi govt’s move to curb black money a ‘disaster’ for rural women, activists say

Senior Delhi Police officers said, on condition of anonymity, random checks on trains bound for Delhi from Bengal, Assam and Bihar, failed to unearth trafficked girls.

“Black money is the backbone of the trafficking industry in India. At the moment that structure has been fractured by demonetisation. It is a matter of time before the new currency is back in the system and the trade picks up. We have approached the PM and informed him of this situation as well,” Satyarthi added.

Russia's nebulous public position on its growing ties with Pakistan continues to give sleepless nights to Indian policymakers who have sought to isolate Islamabad on the issue of terrorism.



After it officially denied reports that it had shown any interest inChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor(CPEC), Moscow has not just declared strong support for the China-funded project but also announced its intention to link its ownEurasian Economic Unionproject withCPEC.



CPEC, which will link Gwadar in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province to Xinjiang in China, remains a major bugbear for Indian foreign policy as it passes through the Gilgit-Baltistan region in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (Pok) claimed by India. Beijing has shown scant regard for India's concerns despite PM Narendra Modi himself having taken up the issue of Chinese involvement in the disputed territory with President Xi Jinping.



Moscow last month emphatically denied Pakistan media reports that it was looking to involve itself in CPEC by acquiring access to the port built by China at Gwadar. Russia's ambassador to PakistanAlexey Y Dedovhas now been quoted as saying that Russia and Pakistan have held discussions to merge Moscow's Eurasian Economic Union project with the CPEC.



Dedov said Russia ""strongly"" supported CPEC as it was important for Pakistan's economy and also regional connectivity.



The mixed signals emanating from Moscow, as strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney said, are injecting uncertainty in the direction of the Russia-India relationship whose trajectory long epitomized constancy and stability.



""It is as if Moscow no longer sees India as a reliable friend or partner. Indeed, by seeking common cause with India's regional adversaries — including by supporting the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor through internationally disputed territory and engaging with the Pakistan-backed Taliban — Russia is challenging India's core interests,"" said Chellaney.



India continues to officially maintain that it doesn't see any ""downward trend"" in relations with Russia even as it works behind the scenes to convince Moscow that Pakistan remained the fountainhead of terrorism in the region. For India though, Russia further queered the situation in Afghanistan by declaring that it regarded Afghan Taliban as a national military-political movement. Russia is looking to engage the Taliban apparently to defeat IS but, as the MEA spokesperson warned last week, India wants any engagement with Taliban to respect the internationally recognized red lines, including giving up violence and severing ties with al-Qaida.



The comments made by Dedov are only the latest in a series of Russian doublespeak on Pakistan this year. As it officially conveyed to Moscow, India was disturbed by Russia's decision to hold its first ever joint military exercise with Pakistan days after Uri terror strike which left 19 Indian soldiers dead. The Russians justified it by saying that the exercise was meant to help Pakistan deal with terrorism.



At the Brics Goa summit in October, Russia chose not to help India publicly name Pakistan based terrorist outfits like Lashkar and Jaish in the official declaration in the face of Chinese resistance.



Russia continues to insist that its ties with Pakistan will not come at India's cost. Asked about the Russia-Pakistan military exercise though, at the recent Heart of Asia conference, Russia's presidential envoy to Pakistan Zamir Kabulov said Moscow didn't complain about India's close cooperation with the US and so India also shouldn't complain about ""much low level"" of cooperation between Russia and Pakistan. India may or may not complain, but it's certainly watching with eyes wide open.

If the allegations and charges are found to be true then there could be a stay against the use of the trademark and Paytm might have to pay hefty damages as per the trademark registration laws of the country. (Reuters image)

Digital payment and e-commerce platform Paytm has been going through rough times. Global digital payments company PayPal has accused the Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s company, which has been reaping a windfall from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation drive, of trademark infringement, according to media reports. The California-based international payment gateway has reportedly filed a case in this regard in the trademark office in India alleging that Paytm has copied its logo that the company has claimed to be using since 2007. If the allegations and charges are found to be true then there could be a stay against the use of the trademark and Paytm might have to pay hefty damages as per the trademark registration laws of the country. Paytm on Friday claimed that 48 customers have cheated the company to the tune of over Rs 6.15 lakh. According to a PTI report, CBI has registered a case in this regard and a probe is on. According to a report, Paytm’s revenues have risen by nearly 200% but losses have increased fourfold.

The complaint from the Manager Legal, M Sivakumar, claimed that the company makes payment for defective products received by a customer and also arranges a reverse pickup of the damaged product which is sent to the merchant. The process is done by a team of customer care executives who have been assigned specific IDs and passwords to handle such complaints from the customers and arrange refund and pickup. It is alleged that the company found that in 48 cases customers had received refunds even though the delivery of orders was made successfully to them. “As a matter of facts wherein delivery of orders were successful and satisfactory to the customer, refund should not happen. However, in all these 48 cases refund of order amount happened to the respective customers to the tune of Rs 6.15 lakh,” the complaint, which is now part of the FIR, alleged. It alleged that customers “illegally” appropriated money refunded in their bank accounts and wallets. It claimed that the acts reflects “serious” fraudulent act and foul play with common intention to wrongfully gain along with such involved customers.

Soon after a political blamegame erupted over issue. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday took shots at the PM as he said that the Narendra Modi government was in Paytm’s pockets. Kejriwal was speaking about reports where it was stated that the Central Bureau of Investigation had lodged FIRs against the 48 customers PayTM had accused of cheating the company of over Rs 6.15 lakh. Kejriwal was retweeting journalist Rohini Singh, who had asked as to why CBI was taking the case when Paytm was not a government firm. Kejriwal said that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself was in the advertisements for Paytm. Kejriwal further said that the CBI would not dare to not take orders from Paytm.

&gt;* A statewide agitation will be launched in all districts at designated places from last week of January and will continue till our demand for quota is fulfilled,"" Malik said.The president of the umbrella organization of Jat bodies, however, said the protest would be completely peaceful on similar lines of their agitation in June.Meanwhile, various representatives of Jat organizations led by AIJSS gathered outside BJP's national office on Ashoka Road in Delhi on Friday and submitted a memorandum in the name of party president Amit Shah regarding demands of the community.The main grievance of the Jat leaders was that after the Supreme Court had quashed the other backward classes (OBC) quota for Jats of nine states on March 17, 2015, PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Shah had invited them at their residences and assured them to restore the quota after removing the discrepancies left by previous regime while giving OBC status to Jats.In their memorandum, submitted to Shah, it was alleged that despite a period of more than one-and-a-half years, the PM and ruling party's president has failed to keep their promises.From November 28 to December 15, the Jat organizations had submitted memorandums regarding their demand for restoration of OBC quota for the community by the Centre to around 100 MPs who were elected from Jat-dominated constituencies.

&gt;* ""We have been begging to the Centre about our legitimate rights for almost two years and BJP is testing our patience by not responding and that is why we have decided to re-launch the next round of agitation from next month,"" Malik added.The Jat stir for reservation in February had turned ugly when around 30 people had lost their lives and hundreds were injured.

&gt;* Public and private property worth crores of rupees was also destroyed.

&gt;* However, the protest launched by Jat community in June remained peacefully.Demands submitted to BJP chief:Inclusion of Jats under OBC quota of Centre through fresh billAction against Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini for his hate speeches causing division in the societyWithdrawal of cases against Jat youths who were arrested by Haryana police for their alleged role in violence during February agitationJobs and compensation to those killed during Jat agitation held in FebruaryProbe by the parliamentary ethics committee against Saini regarding his hate speeches and disqualification from Lok Sabha

Prana held after BJP worker’s complaint. Prana held after BJP worker’s complaint.

MALAYALAM writer and theatre activist Kamal C Chavara alias Kamalsy Prana was arrested by the Kerala Police on Sunday on charges of insulting the national anthem in a Facebook comment. He has been charged with sedition under Section 124A of the IPC.

Police said Prana was arrested from Kozhikode on the basis of an FIR registered at Karunagappally police station in Kollam district, following a complaint by a worker of the BJP’s Yuva Morcha. The case was registered two days ago.

Inspector M Anil Kumar of Karunagappally police said prima facie there was ground for charging Prana with sedition. “But whether the charges would stay, we can say only after investigation.”

They have sent a team to Kozhikode to question Prana, said the inspector.

Watch what else is in the news

Prana had taken a few sentences from his recent Malayalam novel Smamashanangalude Notepusthakam, and posted them on Facebook. The excerpt talks about a situation at a school where teachers do not allow students to go to the toilet during class. At 4 pm, when class is over, the students recite the national anthem. The novel says that for the children, the national anthem meant they could now go to the toilet.

There had been no controversy regarding the novel till Prana’s Facebook post.

The writer’s arrest comes close on the heels of police booking a dozen delegates of the International Film Festival of Kerala for not standing up while the anthem was being played before film shows.

Slamming the registration of a case against him two days ago, Prana had said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should not become a “Kerala Modi”. “Police are depicting me as a terrorist,” he said.

On Sunday, after his arrest, he repeated that the case against him was “illegal”. “I had mentioned in my novel what schoolchildren do when the national anthem is being sung. Dubbing comments in the novel disrespect to the national anthem, police have slapped the sedition charge against me.”

CPM Politburo member and former minister M A Baby said the arrest and sedition charge look like a kneejerk reaction from police. “I hope the government will look into the issue in detail and make necessary corrections. Police acted in a hasty manner without applying its mind and proper examination of the details,” said Baby.

The bill proposes to reduce the number of years, from 11 to six of the last 14, required to live in India to obtain citizenship by naturalisation. REUTERS The bill proposes to reduce the number of years, from 11 to six of the last 14, required to live in India to obtain citizenship by naturalisation. REUTERS

Home Minister Rajnath Singh introduced the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 in Parliament in July this year; it seeks to give citizenship by naturalisation to immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Cimmihristian communities, facing religious persecution and coming to India before December 31, 2014. Such people would be living illegally in the current context of the provisions of the Passport (Entry into India) Act 1920 and the Foreigners Act 1946.

However, while all regions welcomed the move, opposition grew in Assam — on the premise that Hindus from Bangladesh who came thus would obliterate the culture of local indigenous communities. Many of these protests smack of vested interests which have always derailed peace in the state. Several political entities, activists and perennial “student leaders” have been blowing the issue out of context, trying to mislead the public on the applicability of the bill and its actual impact.

Former CMs Tarun Gogoi and Prafulla Mahanta, who are opposing the bill, miserably failed in their long tenures to implement the Assam accord signed in 1985 — but they are trying to take refuge in this now. Their failure was a calculated design to ignore the issue while in power. It also reflected both poor capacity to send back illegal immigrants and votebank considerations. Thus, ration cards were rampantly garnered by many and over three decades, such arrivals mingled in the state. From six such districts in 2001’s census, there are now nine Muslim-majority districts in Assam as per 2011’s census. The number of Hindus has come down in those districts. Also, as informed by MoS, home affairs, Kiren Rijiju in Parliament, there are about two crore illegal Bangladeshis in India.

The Modi government took the call in August to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the bill; this is chaired by Lok Sabha MP Satyapal Singh, a reputed police officer earlier. This committee’s term has been extended till the end of the budget session next year. The committee is doing a meticulous job of examining all the issues closely, with many interest groups. It will offer suggestions that make certain provisions more relevant and implementable, and also hopefully touch on other provisions to fine-tune the bill’s details.

The bill proposes to reduce the number of years, from 11 to six of the last 14, required to live in India to obtain citizenship by naturalisation. This could be further relaxed as persecuted people from the six religions and three countries would have nowhere to go. Also, the amendment of section 6A of the current act would be of paramount importance, so these communities are exempted from its provisions, the term “Bangladesh” being in Section 6A. Further, as the current National Registrar of Citizens (NRC) update is underway in Assam and requires documents to be provided as proof for oneself and one’s ancestors’ citizenship prior to March 25, 1971, in the context of the proposed bill, the same provisions become irrelevant for migrants from these six religions. They should be exempted. Much harassment has already happened with many Bengali Hindus, categorised as “doubtful” for no fault of theirs.

A few arguments are being offered regarding the validity of the bill in the context of reasonable classification under Article 14 of the Constitution, which grants the right to equality by attempting to cover the six minorities from the three countries. But, as the whole issue goes back to the days and basis of Partition, persecuted minorities have to be taken care of on humanitarian grounds. Till date, religious violence continues in the three countries — the recent burning of temples and killings of Hindus in Bangladesh are clear indications of the prevailing situation.

A few quarters have also suggested a separate state for the Barak valley in Assam: That will aggravate problems as many demands will ignite again and create serious law and order issues. The greater Assamese society must prevail now to cover the current ethnic spread across the two valleys — Brahmaputra and Barak — and the hills, so that Assam remains united.

While the bill should be passed at the soonest, the Satyapal Singh-led committee and the government must reach out to various groups, understand the rationale behind their opposition and explain how the legislation benefits Assam and sets right the situation created by the almost non-implementation of the Assam accord. That the cut-off date is already notified and henceforth, no more foreigners will be allowed, should motivate every group to work together to ensure foolproof measures are taken to prevent illegal migrants from entering Assam.

Border-fencing and technology to detect suspect movements should be implemented in a time-bound manner. Equally important is proper documentation for citizens and persecuted minorities who will wait for their turn to apply for citizenship as soon as the time period is satisfied as per the amended act’s provisions. Assam can move forward, instead of remaining a burning state with misplaced political issues.

Shiv Sena on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a cue from US President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to protect jobs for ‘sons of the soil’ and act against Pakistani artistes ‘snatching’ jobs from Indians in the country. “Pakistani artistes, technicians and TV people come to India to earn money, while touting words like friendship and ties. They snatch away livelihood of locals here.

“Can India implement a policy like Trump and say that these Pakistanis won’t get a job here and also declare that those who give work to Pakistanis are the enemies of India,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said.

President-elect Trump had recently said that he would not allow Americans to be replaced by foreign workers, in an apparent reference to cases like that of Disney World and other American companies wherein people hired on H-1B visas, including Indians, displaced US workers.

“What someone like Trump…can do, our PM, who is known as courageous and knowledgeable, can certainly do,” the Sena said.

The Sena claimed that Trump seems to have been inspired by Balasaheb Thackeray on his slogan of ‘jobs in the US for sons of soil only’.

India is going to bear the maximum impact of Trump’s stance and it should be seen how Modi government deals with it by talking to Trump, the editorial said.

Incidentally, Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan called upon MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday ahead of his upcoming film ‘Raees’, which features Pakistani actress Mahira Khan.

The issue of Pakistani artists created a storm this year after the MNS objected to casting of actors from the neighbouring country in Bollywood movies citing their involvement in terrorist attacks in India.

In October, the MNS had staged high-voltage protests against the release of filmmaker Karan Johar’s ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ for featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. But they later withdrew it after assurances from the film fraternity following ‘mediation’ by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to calm tempers.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Uttar Pradesh Police has given clean chit to BJP President Amit Shah in two separate cases of alleged violation of code of conduct during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.



While filing the final reports yesterday, police said there was no evidence against Shah.



Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Arun Kumar has fixed dates for filing of an objection by the complainants in the two cases.



The court has fixed January 17 in Baburam case while January 3 in Ramkumar case for filing of objections, according to the prosecution.



Earlier this year the court had returned the final report to police in the Barwar case filed by Baburam, saying they were deficiencies and asked them to rectify it.



Police had registered case against Shah on the complaint of the then Sub-Divisional Magistrate Baburam under sections 188 IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 123(3) of Representation of People Act (relating to appeal by a candidate to vote on basis of religion, race, caste, community or language) and on the complaint of Assistant Returning Officer Ram Kumar separately in Kakroli and New Mandi police stations in the district.



The BJP leader was accused of making objectionable speeches in Barwar village.Shah had allegedly said that, ""If (Narendra Modi) Modi wins, 'mulla' Mulayam's government will fall"".



The cases against the BJP leader were registered on the directive of the Election Commission which had banned the leader from campaigning in UP.

Rajya Sabha select committee dilutes anti-graft law

Archis Mohan |

Image via Shutterstock The winter session of Parliament that ended this Friday, hit as it was by constant disruptions because of the Narendra Modi government’s “note ban” decision, transacted a little business.

Among the Bills that it didn’t take up for discussion and passing, but was slated to, was a much watered-down Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2013, after a Rajya Sabha select committee had recommended changes to the existing law.

Cutting across party lines, the Rajya Sabha select committee members agreed to a report that substantially weakens even the existing anti-corruption sections of the law. The committee interviewed 85 witnesses and spoke to stakeholders from across the country.

One of the witnesses was Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy, who suggested to committee members to retain a crucial section of the old law, but this was ignored. Swamy argued that deletion of section 13 (1) (d) would make it nearly impossible to prosecute public servants who have misused their official position.

It is the only provision that makes senior public officials liable for criminal action, as Swamy also pointed out, in several big scams, including Bofors, 2G spectrum and coal block allocations. “I want this (section 13 (1) (d)) to be retained as it is. By deleting this, you have, actually empowered corrupt politicians to again engage in the same things that we saw…”

The section defines “Abuse of Official Position” under the overall category of “criminal misconduct by a public servant”. Currently, an investigating officer can prove corruption by establishing that legal provisions, guidelines and rules were violated which led to pecuniary advantage to somebody, including a third party. The investigating officer does not need to prove a direct trail of money, or any other quid pro quo, to have reached the public servant in the transaction. This provision was put in with the knowledge that pecuniary benefits accrue to an official in post-retirement benefits, benami property, etc.

Swamy, among other stakeholders, told the committee that section 13 (1) (d) has been the most successful in ongoing litigations in the Supreme Court in the 2G spectrum and coal block allocation scams.

The section states: “While holding office as a public servant, obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest.” Swamy even argued with the committee that while the Congress-led UPA had reasons to weaken the existing law, but there was no reason for the existing government to do so and advocated retaining of the section.

However, the final report has deleted the crucial section. It has also watered down existing sections that will make it difficult for corrupt public servants being caught red-handed taking bribes, limit the powers of investigating agencies to act against corrupt officials accused of owning assets beyond the known sources of their income and dilute the offence of abuse of official position. It also weakens the Lokpal Act, a body constituted to fight high-level corruption.

The select committee, constituted on December 11, 2015, held 15 sittings and tabled its report at the end of the monsoon session of Parliament, on August 12, 2016.

The committee report, now available on the Rajya Sabha website, claims that the committee’s task was to bring domestic anti-corruption legal framework in conformity with current international practices under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).

It also claimed to have suggested amendments “in view of several judicial pronouncements on the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988”.

But even with deletion of section 13 (1) (d), the committee has ignored UNCAC’s Article 19 that relates to “Abuse of Functions” and is similar to “criminal misconduct” as defined under section 13 (1) (d).

Even where the committee has sought to make the law more consistent with international laws, it has suggested caution. For example, the committee has proposed insertion of the expression “undue advantage” accruing to a public servant.

It is borrowed from the UNCAC, but the committee has expressed apprehension “that the enforcement/probe agencies may misuse” it to “harass public servants”. It “advises that adequate precautions be taken this in this”.

The amendments have also sought to rephrase section 7, which relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.

Other amendments are including deletion of sections 8, 9 and 10 (these relate to public servants being bribed, to bribing a public servant and bribing a public servant by a commercial organisation). As stakeholders pointed out, the deletion of these sections will make it difficult to prosecute middlemen and significantly weakens, let alone strengthening, even the existing anti-corruption provisions.

272,"**The many canards surrounding currency swap**

In this space a fortnight ago (Fixing The Plumbing—Of Our Political Economy, 5 December), I had argued that the Narendra Modi-led government’s currency swap (popularly, but misleadingly, referred to as “demonetisation”) constitutes a classic political economy trade-off: between the short-term costs of the policy and its medium- to long-term benefits. These putative gains and losses may be construed both economically and politically. Last time, I explored both of these, laying stress on the latter, arguing that Modi’s method may be understood as trying to “fix the plumbing” of the economy, the currency swap being but one element of this.

While political commentators may disagree on whether the currency swap will be a winner for Modi politically—my stated view is that I believe it likely will be—economic commentators, at a minimum, should be clear on the monetary economics of the policy. Unfortunately, as is often the case in politically contentious economic policy debates, there has been more obfuscation than enlightenment from many of the usual suspects.

Consider the canard that the currency swap must be considered a failure because a large quantum—of the order of 80% or so—of the old, denotified high-denomination notes have re-entered the formal monetary system either by being exchanged for new notes (a small proportion) or being deposited (a large proportion). The reasoning is that the government supposedly touted a “fiscal bonanza” to be realized by a bonfire of the old notes representing black money, which, therefore, presumably could not be converted or deposited without attracting the attention of the tax authorities, and that this has come a cropper.

There are many fallacies here.

First, one would be hard-pressed to find an explicit, official assertion by the government that a fiscal gain could be realized by cancelling the liabilities associated with old notes that were not turned in by a certain date. This seems to be a claim propagated by the overzealous, that somehow become accepted as gospel truth.

Second, most sensible observers expected that only some fraction of the old notes, representing a portion of black money, would fail to make it into the system—most back-of-the-envelope estimates were around 20%. Well, that is about the percentage we are at now, so, by this metric, that portion of the stock of old notes has effectively been taxed at a 100% rate.

As a corollary, the current situation is one, thus, of a shortage of cash, not of money, and this may be a nudge for the behavioural change towards less cash and more digitization that Modi is seeking.

Third, let us assume that some chunk of the 80% of old notes that have entered the formal financial system represents black money that holders are attempting to launder into white money through one or more of many well-known mechanisms, such as using intermediaries. On the one hand, such holders of black money have paid an implicit tax—some anecdotal accounts suggest that the discount on old notes in the illegal, secondary conversation market is up to 50%. While it is true that the proceeds do not benefit the treasury, they certainly represent a tax on the holders.

ALSO READ | Why demonetisation has been disruptive for India

On the other hand, it is not correct to assume that black money deposited into bank accounts, and thus supposedly laundered into white, will escape scrutiny. Unusually large or suspicious deposits would be audited, and, if irregularities are found, be potentially subject to penalties or confiscation.

This process will not be perfect, to be sure, but the use of modern data analysis (“big data”) could be put to use to sift through the many deposits that have been made since the currency swap went into effect to ferret out such suspicious transactions.

Fourth, those who have argued for, and against, a fiscal bonanza from note cancellation are making a fundamental conceptual error, by conflating the fiscal benefit from bringing black money under the tax net, as discussed above, with the putative fiscal gain to be reaped from part of the currency stock going up in smoke.

The reason is twofold. First, it is mistaken to assume that notes not turned in cease to be a liability on the books of the central bank, unless they are explicitly and legally demonetized—which has not been done thus far.

Demonetisation: A Mint reading list

Second, even if this happens, and as I argued about a month ago (“demonetisation: Fact And Fiction”, 14 November), it is always possible for the Reserve Bank of India to “sterilize” the monetary effects of a portion of the currency stock being destroyed. The latter is a form of negative helicopter drop—call it a “vacuum cleaner”—in other words, a one-shot reduction in the stock of high-powered money.

This can always be reversed, in principle, by an equivalent and offsetting helicopter drop, through conventional open market operations, or even through unconventional monetary policy such as the purchase of non-traditional assets. Depending on the method employed, the composition of the stock of broad money may change, but any effect on its level can be fully offset.

Whether the Reserve Bank of India does so will depend on whether they expect more than merely a transitory deflationary impact. I think it unlikely, based on their rationale for keeping the repo rate unchanged on 7 December.

274,"&gt;Cutting across party lines, the Rajya Sabha select committee members agreed to a report that substantially weakens even the existing anti-corruption sections of the law. 

Proof if ever need that BJP is the biggest when it comes to corruption, yes much bigger than Congress and its 'scams'

How else do you attribute for BJP leading in party funding?

&gt;Swamy argued that deletion of section 13 (1) (d) would make it nearly impossible to prosecute public servants who have misused their official position.

When Modi wants to shield the public servants(??? sic) from CBI and any enquiry, who is this Swamy to oppose it?

&gt;Swamy, among other stakeholders, told the committee that section 13 (1) (d) has been the most successful in ongoing litigations in the Supreme Court in the 2G spectrum and coal block allocation scams.

&gt;Swamy even argued with the committee that while the Congress-led UPA had reasons to weaken the existing law, but there was no reason for the existing government to do so and advocated retaining of the section.

&gt;However, the final report has deleted the crucial section.

So looks like Modi is trying very hard to save the scam tainted. but hey, why would he do that if he and his party is not involved in it? Makes sense?

&gt;It has also watered down existing sections that will make it difficult for corrupt public servants being caught red-handed taking bribes, limit the powers of investigating agencies to act against corrupt officials accused of owning assets beyond the known sources of their income and dilute the offence of abuse of official position. It also weakens the Lokpal Act, a body constituted to fight high-level corruption.

Anurag Thakur at the rally in Ludhiana. (Source: File) Anurag Thakur at the rally in Ludhiana. (Source: File)

Challenging Rahul Gandhi to prove the allegation of corruption he had levelled at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP MP Anurag Thakur said, “I challenge Rahul Gandhi to prove even one corruption allegation against our PM or the BJP-led central government. He can’t do that because neither has he guts nor anything substantial against the BJP government. Why is he quiet after claiming that he has proof of corruption against PM? Who is stopping him.”

Watch What Else is Making News

Thakur had come to Ludhiana to address a BJP youth wing rally on Sunday. He told Indian Express, “If he really has any proof, why is he waiting to speak in Parliament? Why can’t he speak and prove his words outside. The leaders of his own party are laughing at him for making such a statement. After promising an earthquake against Modi ji, Rahul himself has gone underground. He has made a mockery of himself and his party.”

Beginning his speech in Punjabi with ‘Jo Bole So Nihaal… Sat Sri Akal’, Thakur called Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal “mass leader” and claimed, “The SAD-BJP alliance is extremely important to maintain Hindu-Sikh unity in Punjab.” He contniued, “I would like to congratulate the SAD-BJP government for Mohali, Amritsar and Bathinda airports which are operational. Soon Adampur airport of Jalandhar will become operational, too.” Then, realising that Ludhiana’s demand to make Sahnewal airport operational had not been met, Thakur said, “People of Ludhiana need not be disappointed. Soon an international airport will start from here too. By April, we are going to start domestic flights from here.”

Then, training his guns on Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP MP said, “Jo party kabhi Yogendra Yadav ki nahi hui, Prashant Bhushan ki nahi hui, Anna Hazare ki nahi hui aur Dilli ki nahi hui, wo Punjab ki kaisi hogi,” adding that if Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is never visible in Delhi, how will he be visible in Punjab.

Launching a scathing attack on Captain Amarinder Singh, he said, “A man whose morning comes at noon can never be an efficient CM. Our lunch time is his morning tea. Our afternoon is his morning. How can a person with such maharaja lifestyle be the CM of Punjab? He doesn’t know what is the cost of potatoes.”

The Ministry of Finance Monday imposed fresh restrictions on bank deposits till December 30. For amounts exceeding Rs 5000 in old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, they can now be deposited only once per bank account. The money will be credited to the account only after receiving a satisfactory reply from the customer as to why the amount couldn’t be deposited earlier, the Economic Affairs Department said. Also, an equivalent value of specified bank notes tendered may be credited to a third-party account, provided specific authorisation by the third-party. And deposits collected by District Co-operative Central bank between November 10 and 14 in old notes will be subjected to audit checks to verify the KYC documents provided by individuals or members of Primary Agricultural Credit societies. The limit for withdrawals has remained unchanged at Rs 24,000 per week.

The Central government and RBI have been accused by Opposition parties of shifting goal posts ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcement on November 8, recalling old high denomination notes. So far over 50 such directives have been issued, with banks requiring to monitor CCTV footage for suspicious activity being among the latest.

The government had also cut short the dates till which Rs 500 notes could be accepted. Earlier, the government allowed the use of Rs 500 notes to pay for utility bills and medical expenses. The few exemptions granted before have now been lifted.

AHMEDABAD: TheBJPis keen to advance Assembly elections in Gujarat. Parleys to advance the election has been initiated at the top level in the BJP and the RSS. As per schedule, elections are supposed to be held in December 2017 but the BJP is contemplating to prepone it by at least six months. A top BJP leader told Mirror that early elections clearly benefit the BJP. A section of the BJP also feels that 'there should be a total revamp and even the chief ministerial candidate of BJP should be changed"". This is under discussion. While one section feels that Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is not even six months old and imposing another chief ministerial candidate may not augur well for the party, some other senior leaders strongly believe that Rupani lacks the appeal to lead the party in the crucial 2017 polls.



They feel that the best way to counter Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress is by throwing up a leader belonging to Other Backward Class (OBC) as the party's chief ministerial candidate. Nearly 45% of the state's population falls under various OBC categories. This includes 32.5% percentage in rural areas. An OBC chief ministerial candidate could hugely upset the Congress and AAP calculations. It could also consolidate the OBCs against the Patidars who are demanding affirmative action. However, the only catch is, would the public be ready to accept a third chief minister from the same party in a year's time? A senior BJP leader told Mirror, ""No announcement in this regard is likely to come in before end of January but there definitely is a movement to prepone polls in Gujarat.



We feel this will benefit us."" BJP has been doing phenomenally well in Gujarat since 2002. At present, BJP has 123 of the 182 seats in the State Assembly. A source, a BJP leader with strong connections in Delhi, told Mirror, ""A new chief ministerial candidate for the party has not yet been decided so I cannot comment on this but at the moment current Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and senior BJP leader Shankar Chaudhry's names are doing the rounds. A dark horse may also emerge."" RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is camping in Gujarat since last four days.



He is leading a four-day pracharak meeting, chalking out strategies to woo tribals into the BJP fold. He has already spoken to nearly 200 people. ""The BJP and RSS are ready for elections in Gujarat,"" an RSS leader told Mirror. ""We are ready to go to polls along with UP and Punjab. In fact, that will benefit us largely,"" a BJP minister said. Mirror spoke to over 18 different BJP and RSS leaders.



Reasons BJP wantsearly elections in Gujarat



1. At present, the mood in Gujarat is that the inconveniences of demonetization are temporary. The general consensus is 'Narendrabhai has introduced demonetisation to check black money and terrorism'. The BJP feels that as days pass, this pro-BJP sentiment in Gujarat could convert into skepticism.



2. The Patidars and their andolan is amajor issue in Gujarat. The Patels are not in majority in Gujarat but they can stake claim for maximum political influence. Out of 182 seats, 37 Patidars are elected MLAs. Patels can influence up to 80 Assembly seats in Gujarat. At present, Patel leader Hardik has been banned by the courts from entering Gujarat. The Patels and BJP have reached no compromise yet. The situation is expected to get worse.



3. On the whole, 2016-17 has been a good year rainfall wise. The BJP is keen on taking a chance, considering the good rainfall in state. In case of poor rainfall next year coupled by demonetisation, the rural scenario in Gujarat can change which may not be to BJP's benefit.



4. Patidar leader Hardik has teamed up with Nitish Kumar. Nitish is visiting Gujarat in January-end. The BJP feels it should not give Hardik and Nitish time to set up their political game plan in Gujarat. If elections are held in December as per schedule, both Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Nitish could get nearly a year to set up operations in Gujarat.



5. The BJP has changed a chief minister recently.Anandiben Patelwas unceremoniously dropped and Rupani was made the CM in her stead. This, however, has not calmed the social unrest, especially of Dalits and Patidars in Gujarat. Over the months, this unrest is only likely to accelerate to BJP's disadvantage.



6. Gujaratis are oriented towards entrepreneurship. Of late, the economy has been facing a slump. In coming days, the micro-, small-, and medium scale (MSM) industry is going to be impacted further.



7. The Congress in Gujarat has yet not got its act together. In urban areas, even if there is a disillusionment towards the BJP, there is no new-found love for the Congress. The state Congress leaders have so far done nothing concrete to tap the frustration of the common man (and woman) following demonetisation.



8 And perhaps the most important reason why BJP is contemplating early polls in Gujarat could be the growing influence of Aam Aadmi Party. First, AAP captured the imagination of the politically and economically influential Patidars in Gujarat. Then, the Dalits after the tragic flogging in Una. Slowly and steadily, AAP has made significant inroads in rural Gujarat and among youth and women in urban Gujarat.





If AAP does well in Punjab and Goa, their presence in Gujarat could increase manifold.



Indications of an early election in Gujarat



1. Increased political activity. The prime minister has visited Gujarat four times in less than two months. This could be a sign of the party wanting to seek an early mandate. The prime minister's last visit to Banaskantha throws up the probability of an OBC leader being pushed by the BJP. Banaskantha is the home state of BJP leader Shankar Chaudhry. Prime MinisterNarendra Modialso belongs to OBC. In Congress, the OBC faction is represented by party president Bharatsinh Solanki.



2. Increased political activity by the Congress, AAP, JDU etc Rahul Gandhi will be visiting Gujarat on Wednesday. Nitish Kumar is coming in January.

Hardik Patel plans to further consolidate the Patidar agitation. AAP has begun an outreach programme which has been well-received even in urban areas of Gujarat.



3. Increased activity and ground work by RSS including shibirs and personal outreach programme. The personal guidance of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to bring back tribals into the Hindutva fold, besides organising Hindu sammelans.



4. PM Modi will be spending more time for the Vibrant Gujarat summit. The forthcoming Vibrant Gujarat 2017 is being publicised more than what it was in 2015 held under the chief ministership of Anandiben Patel.



5. Revamped prohibition policy in tune of Bihar model as demanded by the Patidars and OBCs in the state.

The AIADMK on Monday announced Rs 3 lakh compensation for families of those who have died of grief post former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death. The party claimed that 597 people have died so far after hearing the news of her demise. The announcement was made on the day newly-sworn in Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam arrived in Delhi to request the Modi government to grant Bharat Ratna posthumously for Jayalalithaa. Construction of an ‘Amma’ bronze statue outside Parliament is also among the list of demands. He is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday and handover a letter seeking Central aid for restoration works in areas affected by Cyclone Vardah.

On Sunday, expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking CBI probe into Jayalalithaa’s death. In her writ petition, she claimed that the circumstances leading to her death were “suspicious”. She also claimed that the people of Tamil Nadu feel that Sasikala Natarajan, Jayalalithaa’s close aide, and her family had a role to play in the former chief minister’s death.

In 2009, when former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y Rajasekhara Reddy died in a helicopter crash, over 100 people reportedly died of shock and grief. The report, however, could not be independently verified.

By Amit varma



I am a great admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, but the man had some strange views. In Hind Swaraj, written shortly after he turned 40 in 1909, Gandhi tore into some of the symbols of the modern age. “Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin,” he wrote. “To study European medicine is to deepen our slavery.” He railed against the railways, saying “it is beyond dispute that they propagate evil.” He argued against lawyers, despite being one himself, saying they had “impoverished the country.” But here’s a thing to note: despite these personal views, he never once suggested that railways, hospitals and lawyers should be banned.



There is a notion being spread these days that is as absurd as the ideas above: it is the notion that there is something wrong with using cash, and that we should head towards being a cashless society. This is nonsense. Acashless societywould be a disaster for India. Here’s why.



One, a fully cashless society would mean the end of privacy. There would be a digital trail of every action you take through your purchases and transfers. If you buy AIDS medication or a porn magazine or book a hotel room for a romantic alliance, this information can be accessed by the government — or any hacker with the requisite skills — and used against you. India has no privacy laws, and data protection is also a big worry — every week we hear stories of some big hacking or the other, from the Congress in India to the Democratic Party in the US.



Two, a fully cashless society could mean the end of dissent. The government can use any data it gathers against you. (Even if you commit no crime, there is much you may be embarrassed by.) What’s more, they could make any opponent a pauper with one keystroke, freezing your bank account while they investigate alleged misdeeds. Just the fact that they have this power could have a chilling effect on dissent. Those in government now may well salivate over this, but tables turn fast, and when they are in opposition, would they want their opponents to have such power over them?



Three, a fully cashless society endangers freedom. Cash is empowerment: ask the young wife who saves spare cash from her alcoholic husband; or the old mother who stuffs spare notes under her mattress for years because it gives her a sense of autonomy. Indeed, in a misogynist country like India, cashlessness would hit women the hardest.



It is a myth that an advanced society must necessarily be cashless. In Germany, a country which knows the perils of authoritarianism, more than 80% of transactions are in cash, as citizens safeguard their privacy and freedom. Even in the US, 45% of transactions are in cash. Note that Germany and the US actually have the banking and technological infrastructure to enable cashlessness. In India, 600 million people have no bank account, and less than 20% of all Indians have a smartphone. Internet penetration is iffy, as is power. (By ‘power’, I mean electricity, not the government’s control over you.) Trying to make India cashless is akin to putting a bullock cart in an F1 race, and whipping the driver because he’s too slow.



It is true that many technologies imperil our privacy, like any app we download on our phones, for example. But those actions are voluntary, and we can choose to avoid them. That is the crux of the matter. My objection here is not to cashlessness per se, but to the coercion implicit in the currency swap of November 8 and its aftermath. A cashless society would only be good if we evolve towards it, not if we are forced into it.



At the moment, the common Indian is wary, for good reason. Digital payments involve transaction costs, are unreliable because of infrastructure issues, and hey, who would trust an Indian bank after what the RBI just did? The beneficiaries of forced cashlessness are not consumers, but vested interests like banks and payment companies. Indeed, this might even be the largest redistribution of wealth from poor to rich in the history of humanity.



The BJP itself continues to take cash donations and shift goalposts. When thedemonetisationwas announced, they said it was meant to attack black money and counterfeit currency. Once it became apparent that those reasons were nonsense, the government tried to change the narrative into one about a cashless society. Within a fortnight of that, they are already backtracking and saying they meant ‘less cash’ when they said ‘cashless’. The truth is this: demonetisation is a humanitarian disaster that is crippling our economy, and no matter how many times Modi and Co try to rationalise it, it cannot be done. One day, these men will stop trying. When they cannot justify any more, they will distract.

Business will begin early for the Indian Parliament next year. With the winter session proving a washout, and the deadline for the goods and services tax (GST) looming, the government could convene the budget session of Parliament as early as the second week of January. The Union Budget itself will be presented on 1 February.

I expect a rash of people-friendly announcements in the budget. The narrative around demonetisation—the government’s move on 8 November to render invalid all old Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination currency notes, 86% of the cash in the system—is turning negative in parts, although it is a measure of the goodwill Prime Minister Narendra Modi still enjoys that most Indians continue to put up with the fallout because they think it is well-intentioned. The move has hit business in the second part of the third quarter (October-December) and could affect business in the next quarter (January-March) too. The government needs to address this and the budget is a good platform to do so. Elections in India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, may happen as early as February. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against the governing Samajwadi Party, the resurgent Bahujan Samaj Party, and the Congress, which may or may not forge an alliance with the second. A year ago, the BJP seemed to be gaining a lot of momentum in the state where it swept the parliamentary elections in 2014 (although people have been known to vote differently in state elections). That’s changed, not the least because of demonetisation, and the budget is, again, a good platform for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government to regain its mojo.

If the elections in Uttar Pradesh have to happen in February, they will have to be announced sometime in early January. The so-called model code of conduct will come into effect immediately, preventing any populist measures from being announced by both central and state governments. This restriction, though, is unlikely to apply to the Union Budget, another reason why it will have to serve as the platform for such measures.

There have already been murmurs within the BJP—they are all you will hear in a party led by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah —about how the fallout of demonetisation is hurting the party, and some people- and business-friendly measures will, no doubt, quell these too. Industry will cheer even a watered-down GST and the government will try its best to finalize the fine-print of one in January. The government will likely announce wide-ranging cuts in income tax, both personal and corporate. That should boost both consumer and business sentiment. The tax cuts may be announced in the budget. With an eye on the rural economy, and Uttar Pradesh, the government is also likely to announce a farm package in the budget.

What else can we expect in the budget?

With the rail budget anyway being integrated with it, the Union Budget already comes with a built-in emphasis (and a big one) on infrastructure. With private investment still not kicking in, the government probably recognizes the importance of spending on infrastructure. The focus on solar and wind power, and highways and inland waterways could continue.

Digital and cashless are perhaps the two most used words by anyone in government since 8 November, when Prime Minister Modi announced the invalidation of old high-denomination currency notes. Both will get a fair share of attention (and money) in the budget too. I expect more sops and incentives for cashless transactions and the makers of hardware required to power such transactions.

Other (perennial) favourites of the government, schemes such as Make in India, Skill India, and Start-up India will likely get a look-in too.

It is important to recognize the kind of budget India needs at this point in time. There are times when a country needs a budget that can spur growth. There are other times when a country needs a budget that can cut expenditure. There are still other times when a country can get by with a middle-of-the-road budget that maintains the status quo. Then, there are times when a budget has to focus on a specific sector—agriculture, for instance. The budget which finance minister Arun Jaitley will present on 1 February needs to have a different and singular objective. Demonetisation has left people feeling low and tired. While it is effecting one kind of behaviour change, towards cashless transactions, it is also encouraging the hoarding of cash and forcing people to defer expenditure. Consumer, business, and investor sentiment are all down. The budget needs to change all that. We need one that is, in letter and spirit, true to that cliché popularized by headline writers—a feel-good budget.

We will probably (and hopefully) get one.

A dry state for almost six decades, Gujarat has now made its prohibition law even more stringent. But that’s only for locals who could now end up in jail for three years and pay a hefty Rs 5 lakh fine if caught with a liquor bottle.

For visitors and tourists though it’s good cheer as access to alcohol has been made easier. The guests can raise a toast by just walking into the hotel liquor shop and furnishing certain documents.

Now, a click of the mouse can get them the permit required to consume liquor in Gujarat.

That’s two sides of the Gujarat prohibition model — strict for residents and friendly for tourists.

The prohibition policy started becoming tourist-friendly during the last few years of the Narendra Modi rule in the state and remained so under his successor Anandiben Patel, with more and more hotels getting licences to run liquor shops. Besides, the process for on-arrival permits at airports and hotels and even e-permits had been eased.

And now, the Vijay Rupani government that faces crucial assembly elections next year seems to have succumbed to the demands of two electorally important communities — OBCs and Patidars — to make the law tougher for locals.

“For the promotion of world class business events like the biennial Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors Summit (VGGIS) and tourism fairs like Rann Utsav (Desert Festival) — both conceived and promoted by Narendra Modi as Gujarat chief minister — the home department had to accept the suggestions of the tourism department to ease the prohibition policy for visitors,” said a top official from the home department.

On the other hand, the government on Thursday, while announcing an ordinance for stricter punishments to tipplers and bootleggers, called it the need of the hour.

“These (amendments) will help stop social, economical and moral deterioration of society,” said minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja.

Under their leader Alpesh Thakor, the OBC communities that account for 40 per cent of Gujarat’s over six crore population, had joined hands with SCs and STs to press for a stricter prohibition law and its better implementation.

Thakor also got support from Hardik Patel, who is spearheading the Patidar quota agitation, and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani.

Besides Patidars and OBCs, the Rupani government also aims to win over women voters with Thursday’s ordinance.

The Narendra Modi government may increase base Income Tax slab up to Rs 4 lakh per annum.

Facing criticism from the opposition over demonetisation, the Narendra Modi government is considering a proposal to revise the base Income Tax slab and increase it up to Rs 4 lakh per annum from the current Rs 2.5 lakh per year, according to a report by India Today news channel.

The channel reported that the government may announce revised tax slabs before the announcement of Uttar Pradesh assembly election dates.

Quoting sources, India Today also said while people in the Rs 4-10 lakh income group may be taxed at 10%, 15% tax is likely for the 10-15 lakh income group. Similarly, while people in the Rs 15-20 lakh income group may have to pay 20% tax, 30% tax may be imposed on those having income above Rs 20 lakh.

If implemented, the new tax proposals will give a huge relief to taxpayers reeling under the impact of high inflation and high tax rates.

Currently, income up to Rs 2.5 lakh is exempt from tax, income from Rs 250,001 to Rs 5,00,000 is taxed at 10%, from Rs 5,00,001 to Rs 10,00,000 at 20% and above Rs 10 lakh at 30%.

However, government spokesperson Frank Noronha rejected the report about new income tax slabs. ANI reported him calling it “‘baseless and unfounded”.

Earlier on December 14, Union Finance minister Arun Jaitley had indicated that the government may reward the common man by lowering both direct and indirect tax rates in Budget FY18 as demonetisation is set to expand the tax net.

While the central bank is remonetising by constantly releasing new banknotes, which would be “significant” in the next three weeks, Jaitley said the strategy is to make future transactions substantially digital to reduce dependence on cash. “Once they (black money hoarders) are substantially digital, they will get caught in the tax net,” he said.

“Therefore, the future taxation level would be much higher than what is currently being collected. This would also enable the government at some stage to make taxes more reasonable which will apply to both direct and indirect taxes,” the minister said.

I'm starting to think that these people are part of some social media cell of the INC(the main opposition party). 


So the PM made a decision to demonetize the high value notes without informing anyone(the 500 and the 1000 Rupee note), including his own party members(or so they claim, who the hell knows) with the stated intent to go after the black money, move the economy towards a digital economy(the phrase used was less-cash economy I believe), and fight the counterfeit notes currently in circulation.


Now the black money is the money that people are hoarding and not paying taxes on, thus also not having the money circulate in the economy, which asking any economist will tell you is not good for said economy. Unlike most of the developed world, people do hoard money in this country. Especially the politicians who also double as thugs and gangs a lot of the time. We're not talking just couple thousand dollars worth but the amount tends to be in millions of dollars worth. Across the country, by far too many people. This move forced a lot of those people to now deposit said money in the bank while also disclosing where and how they got this money or risk having most of it turn useless. Now if it's found out that this money was gotten illegally or was not taxed, the Income Tax Department could take action on these people. There were also a few schemes introduced to let people declare their money before hand several months ago and steps were also taken to get more people into the banking system.


As for going digital is concerned, the rationale was that it'll be easier to keep track of people's money so that it can be taxed properly. Because right now only 2 to 3 percent of the population pay taxes. This move will hopefully increase the tax base. Whether it succeeds or not remains to be seen, as the full effects of this move will not be seen until Feb of next year, at least. Keeping track of people's money should also make it easier to combat the corruption and the bribery culture that is rampant in India. 


As for the counterfeit money, a lot of our domestic terrorists tend to operate on fake currency and there were also reports that the ISI (the pakistani intelligence agency) was slowly flooding the Indian market with fake currency, and that they were also funding extremist groups around the country, almost exclusively with the large denomination notes. Now scrapping these large notes and replacing them with different ones was so that the funds to these groups would dry out quickly. And it takes a lot of times and money to get make good counterfeit currency again, unlike what many here seem to believe. This also plays into the going digital push, as it'll be easier to keep track of the money if the majority is done digitally. 


Now these were the stated goals and they were lofty goals. Whether they will be achieved or not remains to be seen. The bloody move still hasn't even been completed yet. The last day of the whole demonetization(or re-monetization as they're calling it now) exercise will end on Dec 31st I believe. The earliest we'll see the results of this whole things should be around Feb of next year. The long term impact will not be clear until even later. 


But the majority on r/India has already decreed that this is stupidest move in history and that it has and will not have any benefits whatsoever. That this has destroyed the economy. And that the people are suffering and are in agony because they have to wait in lines. I have family living in the middle of nowhere in some no name village in India. I also have family who live in cities and even three relatives who work in banks. Now they all agree that yes people are not happy that they have to wait in ridiculously long lines, sometimes for nothing because the ATMs keep running out of cash. My grandparents and cousins who live in villages had to deal with trying to setup a proper bank account and trying to understand going digital through credit cards and phone payments. It hasn't been that easy on them or the people they know. My banker relatives were completely overworked the past few weeks. 


But the one sentiment that they all shared was that atleast this government was doing something. Anything. To combat the corruption that has plagued this country for decades under the INC(Indian National Congress) rule. The INC made corruption the backbone and bribery the culture of this country for the half century that they ruled this nation. Their last PM was known for maintaining a ""dignified"" silence as his party was found to be complicit in one scam after another. What amazes me is that everything that the people on this sub accuse the BJP and Modi of doing is something the INC is far more guilty of. India has seen far more communal divide and riots and decisions and measures that are closer to fascist regimes under the INC rule than we have seen under the BJP rule. Everyone here seems to conveniently forget how the INC looted this country for decades. And just how many hundreds of millions were truly suffering and dying under their rule. 


Disclaimer: Not a fan or the supporter of BJP. I believe that the top leadership of BJP is filled with either corrupt or incompetent idiots.

  As India continues its scorched-earth campaign against cash, the question baffling many analysts is why a country so unfamiliar with digital payments would outlaw 86 per cent of its currency, the most-favored method of settling transactions.
  





  Sample the following three factoids from a study led by Tufts University researchers:
  





  Fewer than 10 per cent of Indians have ever used any kind of non-cash payment instrument. Less than 3 per cent of the value transacted in the year ending March 2014 used cards. Fewer than 2 per cent of Indians had used a mobile phone to receive a payment, compared with over 60 per cent of Kenyans.
  





  Beyond showing the enormity of the challenge facing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, these statistics are of little relevance now. What's done is done. With Modi asking people to embrace electronic payments as a way of life, investors want to know what shape these digital networks will take, and who'll own them: banks, or non-banks such as telcos and e-wallet apps? Either party's dominance will be wholly artificial.
  





  Indians who have used a mobile phone to receive a payment is less than 2%.
  





  The Tufts researchers see it differently. India, they say, has erred in choosing a bank-led model over a telecoms-led one. ""Consumers have been left unaware of how they might use mobile phones for services other than communications, texting, or Facebook.""
  





  It's true that India doesn't have anything like China's Tenpay, controlled by Tencent Holdings, which runs the WeChat social network, or its larger rival Alipay, owned by Alibaba Group Holding's banking and payments affiliate, Ant Financial. Paytm, the most popular Indian wallet, is tiny versus Ant, which services 450 million customers in China and was valued by CLSA at $75 billion in September.
  





  Although the Indian startup has witnessed explosive growth since the government's November 8 currency ban, tapping opportunities isn't proving to be easy. Paytm launched an in-store payment app last month, only to withdraw it amid security concerns.
  





  Paypal-style wallets, which customers fill from their bank accounts, won't pose too serious a challenge to traditional lenders. But Paytm, as well as mobile operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries, are close to establishing so-called payment banks that can accept customer deposits so long as they only invest in government bonds and don't make loans.
  





  These newer payment systems could have an edge over ATMs and cards from commercial lenders. The latter are simply too smug. Even basic maintenance of infrastructure — like switching ATMs out of Windows XP, which is no longer supported by Microsoft Corp. — is a cost that full-service banks in India avoid incurring, blithely ignoring the security risks.
  





  But with both banks and telcos suffering from a deficit of trust and access, neither should be the No. 1 choice for replacing cash. The only institution whose balance sheet people actually want is the one they've always used to settle transactions: the Reserve Bank of India.
  





  That's not such a bad thing. The government could still meet its goal of a ""less-cash"" society if physical money were to be gradually replaced by a national digital currency, whose lawful use would be certified by a network of distributed ledgers. It would be an official bitcoin, or BharatCoin, as some commentators have called it.
  





  The central bank's balance sheet is already available to the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker, but only via cash. RBI has no idea who owns its currency. With BharatCoin, it would know the identity of owners, though transactions would be scrambled for privacy. As Gadfly's Tim Culpan and Christopher Langner have noted, the goal of a national digital currency is to take ""the banking out of cash.""
  





  Even at the Bank of England, the idea is still just a research project. If Modi had embraced it, the pain of demonetization would have become unnecessary. Given people's preferences, it's still not too late to consider.

&gt; * The RBI announced that people could deposit older notes of an amount over Rs 5,000 just once by December 30, and even on that one occasion, they would have to satisfy at least two bank officials with an explanation for why they waited until then to make the deposit.

&gt; * Later in the day, however, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that one-time deposits of any amount would not attract any questions.

&gt; * Although the RBI circular very clearly contradicts him, Jaitley insisted that only people who repeatedly deposit older notes will be questioned.

Institute of Chartered Accountants of India advisory was withdrawn after receiving flak on social media.



The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which issued a diktat to its members against expressing any negative opinion on demonetisation on any platform on December 9, hastily withdrew its advisory yesterday. According to sources, the advisory was withdrawn after it received a lot of flak on social media.



“Members are strictly advised not to indulge in any nefarious act as to subvert the intentions of the Government in any remote possible way. The members are also advised not to share/write any negative personal views by way of an article or interview on any platform regarding demonetisation,” stated an email sent by ICAI president M Deviraja Reddy.



It also said that, “The recent move of Government of India to demonetize the high value denomination currency as announced by the Hon-’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a welcome step, which has given a definitive boost to the economic growth and dealt a lethal blow to the parallel economy that has cast its ugly shadow on the nation’s economy for long.”



In his mail Reddy also expressed grave concern about some members of the institute indulging in illegal activities and helping businessmen convert their black money into white money. He warned that strict action would be taken against such members under provisions of Chartered Accountant Acts 1949.



The diktat didn’t go down too well with ICAI’s members.



“Whatever was said in the mail was Reddy’s personal opinion and not some directive issued by the ICAI. So, there was no need to worry on this count. Members were free to express their opinion on demonetisation, whatever they might be,” said Pune-based chartered accountant Shridhar Marathe.



Other chartered accountants Mirror spoke to said that the diktat was an infringement on their freedom of speech.



“Though I support demonetisation, such a mail from the president of ICAI is clearly an infringement on my freedom of speech. I will definitely raise this issue in our internal meetings,” said a Mulund-based chartered accountant.



“The email clearly proves that demonetisation has backfired, and the government is now engaging in damage control.”



YP Trivedi, a city-based senior Supreme Court lawyer who specialises in tax-related matters, said, “The professional body can’t issue such diktats to its members, and its members must speak up against such arbitrary directives.”



The ICAI is the governing body of chartered accounts, and its president regularly communicates with its members on important issues related to the profession.

2016 may well go down as a watershed year in history. It was the year when contradictions in the global economy were finally forced out into the open. It was the year of Donald Trump, the year of Brexit. It was the year when the restless masses in advanced economies, fed up with a stuttering economy on the one hand and smug homilies of the liberal establishment on the other, started a political backlash against globalization and immigration. It was the year when the old order started to unravel.

Since the nineties, with the opening up of the formerly statist economies, globalization has been the mantra that was supposed to deliver growth and prosperity for all. And it did deliver stellar growth to Asia, enabling some countries to join the ranks of the developed nations within a generation and others to substantially reduce poverty. But the vast increase in the global labour force also held down wages in the advanced economies and reduced labour’s share of income. At the same time, the rise in immigration ignited racial tensions and led to the revival of nationalism and the rise of the far right.

For a time, these economic and social fissures were papered over by keeping interest rates low and stoking a debt-fuelled boom, especially in housing. In peripheral Europe, fiscal deficits were ramped up to pay for social welfare programmes. At bottom, though, a huge question, hastily smothered, remained: now that the emerging markets could supply skilled and educated labour at a fraction of the wages prevalent in the West, could the high-cost developed nations compete while carrying the burden of the welfare state? And how could these democratic societies deal with the whittling down of social welfare? Those questions, with all the social turmoil that they imply, came out in the open when the financial bubble burst in 2007.

The upshot: nine years after the great financial crisis, the backlash has finally begun. The masses in the developed economies are now raising their voices against what they see as a steady drain of jobs to immigrants and across the border. They are demanding that their companies create jobs at home instead of halfway around the globe. They are fed up waiting for the promised good times. Political and economic nationalism is on the rise. The old hypocritical elite has been shown the door, the gloves are off and to quote Marx, ‘man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind’

Consider that, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) database, the per capita income at constant prices of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden were all lower in 2015 than in 2007. For the UK, per capita income at constant prices was higher by a mere 0.8% in 2015 compared to 2007. For the US, it was higher by 3.5%. And if the growth of per capita income is so dismal, consider what income growth will be for the working class. A new study on economic inequality in the US by economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman says that from 1980 to 2014, the share of income received by the bottom half of the population fell from 20% of the total to just 12.5%.

The IMF has continued to mark down its estimates of global growth. And this is the state of affairs after almost limitless monetary stimulus. It’s little wonder then that most people are deeply sceptical of the abilities of the old elites to get them out of the mess.Nor are emerging markets doing much better. Tepid growth in the advanced economies has cut the wings of the export-oriented growth strategy pursued by Asia’s ‘flying geese’, bringing them crashing down to earth. The slowdown in China has led to lower commodity prices, which in turn has led to slower growth in commodity producers all over the world, from Brazil to Russia, though there are now signs that commodities may finally be turning the corner. Oil producing nations are desperately trying to shore up crude oil prices. Trade growth has faltered. The IMF and the Bank for International Settlements have warned of the rise in debt levels.

As economies falter and fissures within societies grow, charismatic ‘strongmen’ politicians have positioned themselves as saviours who will rescue them from an effete, corrupt and incompetent establishment. They range all the way from Trump in the US to Modi in India to Duterte in the Philippines to Xi in China to Putin in Russia and Erdogan in Turkey. In a world grown disenchanted with the old ideologies, maverick strongmen are seen as the only hope. It is another matter altogether if the fond hopes placed on these messiahs will bear fruit.

We have seen a similar movie before, in the last century. The period before the First World War was also a period of globalization, albeit with the UK as its leading light. We all know how that story ended. So, as 2016 ends, we are faced with a stagnant world economy, slowing world trade, more protectionism, growing inequality, rising nationalism, increasing policy uncertainty and a motley crew of maverick strongmen steering the ships of states. It’s a brave new world.

NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: The government'semail address for black money tipoffs+has been flooded with 4,000 messages since Friday, when blackmoneyinfo@incometax. gov.in was made public. ""We are getting a good response,"" a finance ministry official told ET.



That's in addition to vast amounts of data flowing to tax authorities and other investigative agencies on a daily basis about deposits in bank accounts and other undeclared income through theFinancial Intelligence Unit(FIU), part of the finance ministry. The government is already acting on the FIU information. ""The system is capturing a lot of data,"" the official said. ""We are able to get daily reports on deposits made and that is the reason agencies have been able to carry out focussed action.""



The allegations contained in the emails will boost the government's ongoing efforts toroot out black money+.Income taxand enforcement directorate officials have been conducting raids across the country unearthing old and new currency apart fromjewelleryand other high-value items. Several bank officials have also been detained, suspended or sacked for swapping old notes with new without authorisation. The information received relates to deposits in Jan Dhan and urban cooperative bank accounts, loan repayments, credit card payments, electronic transfers, withdrawals, among others.



Information also poured in regarding high-value purchases including jewellery,luxury goodsand realty. Companies showing high cash balances could also come under the taxman's radar.



Given the amount of data the government has, the belief that all money deposited in banks has been converted into legitimate wealth may be misplaced as banks have been taking note of unusual deposits and alerting authorities.



For instance, the alleged wrongdoing by employees was reported by the banks themselves to the FIU and the information was then used by other investigation agencies, officials said.



State Bank of India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and others have been getting large deposits after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on November 8 that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes would cease to be legal tender.



All banks are required toreport suspicious transactions+to the FIU. It could not be independently verified how many banks have sent alerts.



The government unveiled the whistleblower email last Friday along with the rules for the
  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana
  income declaration scheme for people to send information about possible money laundering.



""People who have knowledge of money launderers can give direct information to us,"" revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia had said.

420,"**Engagement on Smart Cities initiative: US trade body flags clarity of plans, autonomy of states**

AECOM is partnering with the Indian government in developing Visakhapatnam into a smart city. AECOM is partnering with the Indian government in developing Visakhapatnam into a smart city.

More autonomy to states for funding projects, greater clarity about the plans and initiatives of the government alongside an exclusive channel for US investors are the key issues the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) officials flagged in their engagement with India on the Smart Cities initiative.

“…what we continue to do is that we keep on inquiring have you set the SPV, what does the SPV mean…with the minister of urban development or the secretary or down through, we get different messages sometimes, too. I know they are working hard at it but they are saying now that we had this (smart cities) competition and the money has gone to the states, then we go to the states and some states say we don’t have the money because these things haven’t been done. What we do is just encourage more of that Centre-state work through your pieces there, because in the US government we do have this mission of national engagement where for some projects there are engagements with states as well, but what we do is that there is co-partnership to keep pushing on that,” Vinay Vijay Singh, deputy assistant secretary, US department of commerce, said.

Watch what else is in the news

Singh said governance is critical so that more can be done in enabling the cities. “Right now, the states have a lot of autonomy, but it’s the smart cities programme enabling the cities to have more of the autonomy to make more of these decisions,” he said.

While acknowledging the support received from the Andhra government, officials from AECOM, which is partnering with the Indian government in developing Visakhapatnam into a smart city, said that there is a need for clarity in governance for execution of projects as those involve huge amounts of investment.

“Clarity will be nice. In Vizag (Visakhapatnam), in particular, there were talks of a new airport. It would need significant investment, so clarity around these, what is in works and how are they working forward would be helpful for the business side,” Ashley O’Connor, vice-president, Region Business Line leader, AECOM said.

The USTDA officials also spoke of how an exclusive investment desk along the lines of the ones provided to Japan and Korea will be conducive for attracting investment from US investors. “A special cell will definitely help,” Devin Hampton, USTDA chief of staff, said.

The officials said recent initiatives such as a pilot for municipal bond issuance in Pune will also help in attracting more private investment in the smart cities. “…with our partners and the department of treasury, there is a municipal bond pilot happening in Pune and we look to foster municipal bonds or public-private partnerships but those are the things the governments behind the scenes are trying to enable initial funding to let the private sector then come in and actually support these projects…these are all things to enable and to get private sector get more involved. So, we are working with World Bank to channel their money as well to eliminate the initial risk involved in such projects…,” Singh said.

The USTDA officials sounded optimistic about retaining the current momentum of project implementation for Ajmer, Allahabad and Visakhapatnam, in which the country is partnering with India even as the US is in the transition phase for ushering in a new regime under President-elect Donald Trump.

“We are in early stages. Transition teams have come to department of commerce. We have shared our plans, initiatives and priorities. So those (smart cities projects) have been included,” Singh said.

As part of its initiative to develop 100 smart cities (the number later increased to 109), Prime Minister Narendra Modi after his meeting with the US President Barack in September 2014 had announced partnership plans with the US to develop three Indian smart cities of Ajmer in Rajasthan, Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, following which the USTDA had signed MoU with the three states.

421,"**Handlooms fall silent in Varanasi, $1 trillion hidden economy stalled**

___

[IMAGE](http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/12/29.jpg?w=759)

___





Zainul Abedin, 39, weaver, poses for photograph inside his handloom at Kotwa village in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, on Thursday Dec. 8, 2016. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg Zainul Abedin, 39, weaver, poses for photograph inside his handloom at Kotwa village in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, on Thursday Dec. 8, 2016. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg



In Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political base of Varanasi, Hinduism’s holiest city, weaver Zainul Abedin stares at the uneven mud floor of his home. Behind him, more than a dozen handlooms lie idle. Abedin is part of the collateral damage of Modi’s Nov. 8 decision to ban high-value currency notes, effectively cancelling 86 percent of cash in circulation. The move was designed to stifle corruption and tax evasion, but many of the hardest-hit are workers in India’s vast and intricate informal economy — the small businesses, shops, drivers and countless other basic industries and services that employ more than 90 percent of Indian workers.



Most are poor like Abedin, who earns Rs 250 a day, but collectively they account for almost half the economy. That’s some $1 trillion, or more than the GDP of Indonesia. “Modi’s cash ban has broken our backs,” said Abedin, 39, who makes Varanasi’s famous silk fabrics, shot with gold and silver, and says he can no longer feed his children. “We weavers won’t last if this continues for even another month.”



The cash ban is a massive gamble for Modi, who is trying to persuade ordinary Indians that they will benefit in the long run as rich tax evaders are forced to surrender hidden hordes and pay their fair share toward government spending. Uttar Pradesh — which houses Varanasi — will be the acid test to see whether he’s succeeding. The nation’s most-populous state is ground zero for India’s shadow economy, with the largest share of the nation’s estimated 60 million non-farm, unincorporated enterprises according to the latest government data.



Elections due early next year in the state, which contributes about a seventh of lawmakers in parliament, will be considered a referendum on Modi’s demonetization drive, before national polls in 2019, with both ruling and opposition parties making it a key issue. Successive governments turned a blind eye to India’s booming underground marketplace, giving it space to form intricate supply chains where commerce thrives even as account books record little industry. The reliance on cash helps avoid India’s byzantine regulations, fueling a unique approach to innovation called jugaad, now openly discussed in global business schools. Fewer than 5 percent of Indians declare their incomes and 1 percent pay income tax.



“These are precisely the kind of things Modi wants to change,” said Hansraj Vishwakarma, who heads Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in Varanasi. “People may have to suffer a bit in the short term but it will help the economy in the long run.” The opposition Congress party, which governed India for most of its history, says the cash crunch is damaging the development of the economy and disproportionately hurts the poor, while the rich continue to salt away their wealth.



“The Prime Minister single-handedly decided to declare war on the world’s fastest-growing economy,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said at a Dec. 2 briefing. “A huge portion of India’s poor people use cash. These are honest hardworking people. All cash is not black money and all black money is not cash.”

Economists slashed growth estimates for the year to March but several, including analysts at the Asian Development Bank, forecast expansion to rebound in the following 12 months. The Reserve Bank of India has been more circumspect, suggesting that the cash ban’s impact seems transitory, but that more data must be analyzed. The process of replacing the amount of money lost — either through new bills, digital payment systems or by boosting government spending — could take months.



At the heart of the problem is the way informal businesses like the Varanasi weavers make payments. When the clothmakers deliver an order of saris, they get a “bearer check,” payable to whoever presents it at the bank. Like a parallel currency, these cash-checks are passed among a chain of suppliers to settle accounts until they reach the bank, often via a moneylender who provided the initial lump sum for bulk raw materials or new equipment.



“The small producer has borrowed from the informal sector, which means more often than not from the local moneylender,’’ said Pronab Sen, country director at London-based International Growth Centre and formerly India’s top government statistician. Now the moneylenders are saying “pay me back in new currency.” Daily wages are also paid in cash, which is then used to pay shopkeepers for food and other necessities.



Moneylenders are a key part of India’s economy, charging higher, sometimes usurious interest rates but requiring few formal guarantees. The nation has just 13 bank branches per 100,000 people and only about one in four people have access to the internet. Single households run about 96 percent of the nation’s unincorporated non-farm enterprises and only 1 percent got loans from the government, latest data show.



Bank Queues

Modi’s cash decision has forced many families to spend as many as four days a week lining up to withdraw money or exchange old bank notes, costing them an estimated 615 billion rupees in lost business through Dec. 30. Modi has pleaded with the public to give him until the end of December to solve the problems created by the sudden shock of the ban.



“The lines are so long that my turn almost never comes on the same day,” said Mumtaz Ahmed, 38, who has six looms lying idle a few houses away from Abedin’s. Yet, Mumtaz says he supports Modi’s move, which he believes will penalize the rich more than the poor.



That’s bad news for the Congress party, which traditionally claimed to champion the rights of the poor. Modi blames the Soviet-style policies of previous Congress-led governments for fostering India’s shadow economy. Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi — Rahul’s grandmother — raised tax rates as high as 99 percent in the 1970s and largely controlled industrial development.

Separating illegal and legal payments in India’s cash economy isn’t easy. In Varanasi’s cloth markets on the banks of the Ganges, India’s holiest river, printed receipts are rare and purchases are recorded on handwritten slips of paper. The weavers are among the most famous of India’s 4.3 million handloom workers, the heart of a textile industry that is the country’s biggest sector employer after farming and contributes 13 percent of exports.



The Varanasi weavers, mostly Muslims, make the Banarsi sari, a 17-foot-long piece of silk that is a regular of Indian bridal trousseaux. More than 60 percent didn’t have a bank account as of Nov. 9, according to Shashikant, a 36-year-old project coordinator at the All India Artisans and Craftworkers Welfare Association, who goes by one name. The group has since helped more than 2,000 open no-frills accounts under Modi’s financial inclusion push, though they still require cash for many transactions.







Political Bribes

Poor workers and unscrupulous businessmen aren’t the only ones to benefit from the anonymity of cash. Currency in circulation normally spikes before elections as local leaders hoard bank notes to bribe voters. Even when it comes to electronic payments, the law requires political parties to declare only a few high-value transactions. Donations to Modi’s BJP more than doubled in the year he swept to power, of which almost 70 percent was from undeclared sources.



Modi should have tackled this political corruption first before he banned bank notes that so many ordinary Indians rely on for daily life, said Ravindra Chaurasia, 54, who has a little stall on the banks of the Ganges selling paan, a chewy combination of betel leaf, areca nut and tobacco.

422,"I'm reminded of an old video of Lee Kuan Yew(former PM of Singapore) who spoke about what he'd do if he was PM of India. He was in very advanced age so he spoke slowly compared to his youth, but it is well-worth watching in [full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vELNwtQO1E).

A short summary: There is no ""India"". When Modi speaks in Hindi he only reaches about a third of the population natively. When the Chinese president speaks, he reaches 90% in one go. Even if you have plenty of dialects in China, almost everyone understands Beijing-dialect Mandarin.

There are structural differences in a country like India that makes it more akin to the EU than to China. You have many nations/cultures/languages in one big place. 

This isn't to excuse Modi, whom I've found to be a blowhard and an incompetent, but I think we should temper our expectations that someone else would be a spectacular success by default. They may do a better job, but there are limits to what you can achieve in a deeply de-centralised and highly diverse/heterogenous society like India.

His antics sometimes (now most of the times) totally betray the kind of politics he was supposed to represent. Like hugging Lalu, all BS about note-bandi and Calling Jung a chess piece of Modi..... seriously?? It sounds like the BJP propoganda which called AAP congress' B-Team.

Demonetisation has been terribly implemented, no doubts about it, but the structural impacts won't (in my limited opinion)  beyond the first quarter of 2017. Unlike say the utter mismanagement of the rural economy by the UPA II leading to 10%+ inflation year on year, wiping out savings and causing immense rural distress.

Problem is, the above is not easy to understand or as clickbaitey as your post, hence nobody talks about it.

Swach Bharat is a societal change, literally nothing one man or even 100,000 people can do anything about.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday claimed the corruption level in the country has grown after demonetisation. “The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) had on November 8 said that demonetisation aimed to finish corruption. But has corruption ended even by one percent after that? In fact, it has increased since then. Black money is on the rise,” he said.

Watch What Else Is making News

The AAP national convenor was addressing an election rally in South Goa’s Cuncolim constituency. “I am begging before you on behalf of the entire country to save our nation. Today a huge scandal has been unleashed on the country in the name of demonetisation. The economy is in distress,” he claimed.

Kejriwal alleged that the tourism industry in the coastal state was in trouble and even the fisheries business was affected due to the move.

“I have seen in the entire country the industries are getting closed. The farmers are not able to work. Country’s economy is sinking.

“There is also a rumour that demonetisation scheme is good but its implementation is bad. But I feel that the scheme itself is bad. Modi’s intention with this move is also bad,” he said.

The Delhi Chief Minister also claimed that since demonetisation, several cases of corruption have come to light.

“Corruption is going on even in banks. Bank officials are asking for bribe to exchange old notes,” Kejriwal alleged.

He said if Modi wanted to finish corruption or curb black money, he should have taken action against the 648 people, whose accounts are in the Swiss bank.

“The who’s who of India are in that list. First, Congress did not take any action and now Modiji is also not acting against them. Modi’s friends’ names are on that list.

“If he (Modi) really wanted to finish corruption, the first thing he should do is arrest all the 648 people and corruption will be finished,” Kejriwal said.

He said demonetisation was a “Rs 8 lakh crore scam”. “Modi’s intention is not to finish corruption. It (demonetisation) is Rs 8 lakh crore scam. The super rich have taken bank loans, out of which Rs 8 lakh crore has been siphoned off by Modi’s friends. CAG has said that out of this 50 per cent has been sent abroad,” the AAP leader alleged. “In last two years, Modi has waived off loans worth Rs one lakh 13 thousand crore. In February, the Supreme Court has asked for the list of the people, whose loans have been waived off due to which the banks went empty,” Kejriwal claimed.

He alleged that demonetisation was a “conspiracy by Modi and (BJP chief) Amit Shah”.

“They stopped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes which would be deposited in the banks so that the loans of super rich can be waived off,” he added. Goa goes to polls next year.

455,"&gt;Ram Charan Tiwari, originally from Muzaffarpur in western Uttar Pradesh, said that he had been driving other people’s cars for 22 years. His salary was also Rs 15,000 a month. He was not sure if the car he was driving cost Rs 6.4 crores or Rs 64 crores – it was a sum so large that he could not get his head around it. It was also one of four similar cars that his employers’ family used, he said. They were politically connected distillery owners.

&gt;Tiwari had no illusions about black money vanishing – one of the purported reasons for demonetisation. But he said that he hoped that the government would place curbs on the lifestyle of the rich. “For example, if the government said that no one can buy more than half a kg of gold,” he said. “[Or said that no one could] own more than two cars”.

Half the article the author gives examples of how the poor support demonetisation because they think it will make the rich less rich, and then then goes on to say its not schadenfreude!

The author talks about how auto drivers are happy that 
&gt;“It makes no difference to our lives,” said another auto driver. “It will only make a difference to people who have money. Maybe people don’t say it openly, but there is also pleasure in seeing the rich made uncomfortable, for once.”

She should have asked Ram Charan Tiwari if his distillery owners have stood in line at ATM's? The auto drivers and other such people have been fooled to believe people standing in ATM lnes are BM hoarders! Which is why they are happy BM is somehow going to be curbed.


&gt;Uncertainty about getting work, being short of cash, being in debt, standing in queues or making several trips to get their government-provided entitlements, being treated badly in banks and other public institutions are all part of the everyday experience of most working class Indians. The fallout of demonetisation is only one more such experience.


That being a part of their everyday experience only implies it is felt more so by them at this juncture because ordinary people are not willing to spend money freely and thus these poor people who earn their daily wages from such spends do not have any money or any job!

&gt; The prime minister, has an unerring sense of where the social fault lines lie.


Social fault lines - the rich vs poor and the corruption that runs deep, not just Modi, everyone has an ""unerring sense of it""  too!

But what has he done to change it?

Will the Demonetisation just tear apart the rich poor divide? Will it stop corruption in its tracks? Will the auto drivers not need to pay for their RC registrations come next time? Will the maids not need to pay the 'bribes' in form of registration fees etc for their wards in schools next year?

&gt;The prime minister, however, whom we can fault for his poor decision-making style and lack of policy acumen,

The author clearly identifies Modi's lack of policy acumen and piss poor decision making skills - basically a Pappu Version 2.0",2016-12-20 12:22:55

If the govt didn't foresee this when they made the promise, they have no business being a govt. 

&gt; If the banker complains only for side cash, then record it. 

Yeah, Right. Everyone in India is a literate person armed with a smartphone. The targets for side cash will be illiterates.
&gt; Bankers behaviour isn't govt responsibility it is banks and then the people themselves.

Bankers behavior is the govt responsibility when the entire schemes rests on the bankers efficiency or lack of it. The govt has literally left the bankers responsible for accepting cash over 5k rupees. If I'm a banker in charge of the questioning, I'd prefer to err on the side of caution because the IT may think I'm a crook banker who allowed people with invalid reasons to deposit money. In the process, I'll severely restrict more people depositing money by being more cautious because it is less risk for me and my bank. ",2016-12-20 12:32:11

also,the randi-rona is not gonna stop.But hey,you should be gentle,these guys need a safe place for their venting

the fact is,every effort was made by media and the Congress Pr machinery,which has it's roots in all the media organisations on account of their bias and money,in 2014 to stop Modi. But they failed.they have kept trying since then,and while the Government hasn't made necessary efforts  to invest in media propaganda and PR machinery.

This hate of reality is the culture of every shakha and of every fool that passes by that institution. At the core of Modiji is a dim witted pracharak at war with reality.

Because this never happened. This directly after his govt, under the govt he supported (Chandhra Sekhar had 64 MPs, Congress 197).

Just supported computerization doesn't clear him. Isn't Modi being called incompetent buffon, while achieving much more than Rajiv Gandhi ever did. 

And economic growth picked up? The graph I see, 

1980  1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991

He had the ruled from 1984 October to December 1989. And supported the govt from Nov 1990 to June 1991. I see one year of exceptional growth. While, iirc, growth under him was 3.5 %, in comparison to 2.5 under Indira and 1.5 under Morarji (2 years with demonetization). 

Mired in corruption, Rajiv Gandhi was nowhere near, P. V. Narasimha Rao. Show me where is the increased growth, they are same with one year, all that goes away in the light that those values are fueled by what occurred in the 1991 financial crisis.

Whatever grievances I have with the BJP and it's choice of certain allies, the opposition is far far worse than anything these people have done. 

AAP and Kejriwal turned out to be just as incompetent as they claim everyone else is. Rahul and the INC are some of the most corrupt, parasitic worms the country has been plagued with. They ruled for half a century, virtually unopposed and failed to so much as guarantee drinking water to the whole country, forget electricity and education and everything else. They had half a century to prove themselves and they failed utterly and completely in pretty much every aspect. Mamata and Trinamool are nothing more than goons that belong in a different era.

---

&gt; * With just over a week to go before we bring the curtains down on note-badli  the exchange of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new ones  we now have enough facts from which we can deduce how the Narendra Modi government nearly ended up with a fiasco.

&gt; * The four starting facts we have to work on are the following: the number of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes with the public as given out by the Finance Ministry in parliament (Rs 15.44 lakh crore as on 8 November); the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) reply to an RTI query, where it stated that it already had Rs 4.94 lakh crore of the new Rs 2,000 currency notes printed and ready on 8 November; the central bank also said that Rs 20.51 lakh crore was the value in these notes, Rs 11.38 lakh crore in Rs 500 notes and the balance Rs 9.13 lakh crore in Rs 1,000.

&gt; * Assuming the numbers put out by the Finance Ministry and the RBI on 8 November are correct, one can deduce that about Rs 5 lakh crore of demonetised notes were already in the banking system, leaving only a potential Rs 15.44 lakh crore to be replaced.

&gt; * The irony is this: the ATM problem made it impossible to disburse the cash actually printed (Rs 2,000) and the slow rate of disbursals through bank counters ensured that very little cash was actually going to the public, accentuating the shortage psychology.

For example, there are many ways to criticise demonetization. Implementation, changing rules etc. But, he goes one step above and shouts ""8 lakh crore scam"", ""it is a scheme to transfer money into corporate pockets"" kind of kinds of arguments that make him look stupid. He basically throws allegations without any basis and repeats the same stuff ad nauseam.

&gt; * The opposition Congress party, which governed India for most of its history, says the cash crunch is damaging the development of the economy and disproportionately hurts the poor, while the rich continue to salt away their wealth.

&gt; * The Reserve Bank of India has been more circumspect, suggesting that the cash bans impact seems transitory, but that more data must be analyzed.

&gt; * Modi should have tackled this political corruption first before he banned bank notes that so many ordinary Indians rely on for daily life, said Ravindra Chaurasia, 54, who has a little stall on the banks of the Ganges selling paan, a chewy combination of betel leaf, areca nut and tobacco.
