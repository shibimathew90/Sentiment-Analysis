0,"&gt;**Yes, I know that there's some logic in this.... the ""poor friendly/business unfriendly"" UPA might've been more prone to levying charges,** whereas they don't expect Modi to... and hence they're more comfy in getting locked into deals, but ALL THAT IS SPECULATIVE. Where's the extension of good-faith?

There's more to this. They were disillusioned that the UPA government wouldn't even reply within a month or two of the proposals being submitted. They'd rather wait and see government become more efficient and then get a fast turnaround than lose sleep over pending proposals.

1,"Oh for fucks sake .


If god, Modi or mms had been in charge it would NOT have made a difference. I know this seems to get in the way of many people's fantasies and desire to pin blame, but please for gods sake, know what's going on.

This uptick is also NOT, the Modi effect. Get your damn causes correct.

The biggest thing, the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs so to speak, was the great recession of 2008. It killed - everything GDP and business related.

The world markets are picking up now, and so - obviously - India is also picking up.

This is NOT the Modi effect. The various changes he has implemented will take time to bear fruit. Long term infra and project and even licenses take time for their ingress into reality from planning. There are some core effects in the short term from having a decisive majority, a budget that continued sensible policy and so on, yes. But this isn't why the markets will tick upwards.

But the major things Modi is working on, will be significantly more important than just these current piddle numbers. IMO, India can manage 7% growth without government policy and assistance of the level that Modi can provide.

We managed 9% under  the UPA, driven by global cues - our internal markets aren't very developed or lucrative enough/spend happy because of buyer habits and plain wealth distribution.

We will hit 9% again, on the backs of just sheer business ability (provided no long term new macro factor queers the pitch). I predict that the Modi effect will kick in gradually, and push the growth rates even higher.

The biggest thing we have to solve- right now - is staying ahead of the commodity cycle, and oil prices.

6,"&gt;This uptick is also NOT, the Modi effect. Get your damn causes correct.

The uptick is the effect of a bullishness on a near-certain NDA, if not BJP victory.

While market recovery also plays a role, it won't result in such a high growth alone. It has to be a combined effect.

Saying that Modi wave had no effect on the increase in growth would be completely incorrect.

I will also say that Modi is not going to bring back a strong economy simply because he's PM. If he manages to make government services at the central level efficient, that's what is going to bring the growth back.

So I'm not saying that reaching 5.7% now means it will reach 6.5-7% at the end of the year. I'm saying that it will probably hold at around these numbers for a year or year and half and only if there's tangible changes in how the government works for the non-government, that too for the better, will we see improvements in growth.",2014-08-30 01:37:06

In the interest of the country, I hope the left can pull its act together. Embrace markets and FDI - at least partly. Invest in physical infrastructure. Go for improving social freedoms - not pseudo secularism and blind muslim appeasement.

Ever heard of Political meetings ? Hawkers ? Parking ? or something the left indulges in all the time, protests ?. There are police permissions, clearance from Civic authorities and rent.

Oh, here is another thing, **the constitution draws legitimacy from the people not the other way around**. When the constitution was initiated and the state came into existence, there were no limitations on traditional lifestyles of the people. To change the terms of the agreement today is bad faith. It is a basic premise of the law that the lack of law favors the defendant.

If you are okay with changing the terms of the state today based on popular opinion, you're welcome to advocate that pandora's box. Then, I will push for a Hindu rashtra so that I can celebrate without being called a bully and thug for living my lifestyle that I share only with those who want to partake in it.

Also, How much economic activity do festivals bring in ? Are you willing to forego that, ever heard of shopping festivals ? Would you protest then also, if some streets are blocked for promoting commerce as it is done all over the world ? If you don't, you're a hypocrite.

If you say that any usage of public infrastructure should be unanimous, then will you allow for Hindu only cities so that they can live their heathen lifestyles ? Do you want to create a Hindu flight (similar to white flight) because you don't want to show an ounce of flexibility.

There is the benefit of a strong un fractured government, and this benefit would accrue to both the UPA or the NDA. Seeing as the budget was also a continuation of policy (which isn't bad, since the policy is good but needs to be implemented). These bumps are not Modi related.

What is Modi related is the belief that it will be a more business friendly government, but this is too nebulous for people to act on.

There's basically some amount if election effect, followed by a macro resurgence.

The BRIC nations enjoy huge growth during the bull phases of the market, and India and china need to see 6%+ to keep the populace happy. During UPA 1 these numbers were achieved. 

So for India. 5.7 -7% is just getting back on track. 

Global demand drives way more for our exports and hence productivity. 

And for gods sakes, look at the time period. Modi isn't magic, his work needs time to start making an impact. Infra moves in particular are really long term problems, as would be GST.

&gt;the ""poor friendly/business unfriendly"" UPA 

No, the way MoEF is treated is a stark pointer to the difference in the way UPA and Modi approach things. Under UPA, projects worth Rs 50,000 crores were held up over their entire term. Under NDA, the MoEF has a mandate to close (approve or deny) projects with a maximum of 4 file moves and a month. You as a Quirite can see this online for [yoursef](http://forestsclearance.nic.in/). It is very private sector like in it's efficiency - tells you how many files submitted, how many pending at what level, how many cleared. Now contrast this with UPA when after Jayanthi was sacked, they literally found physical files in her office on which she (and UPA) had been sitting on for years, and to even know progress, you would have had to influence and bribe somebody.

To say that the UPA was ""business unfriendly"" is a massive massive understatement, they were only crony capitalist (Ambani, Jindal, Maran etc) friendly and downright hostile to the others.",2014-08-30 10:17:48

Anyway, my argument is severely emphasizing macro factors. I don't see too many major step function like policy which will really boost the economy .

Gst is languishing - If I see it come back alive, I'll expand my domestic market outlook.

FDI in retail - dead, so most consumption patterns will match historic patterns since the system hasn't been changed.

Logistics - picking up, but by now it's been baked in.

Commodity cycle/ super cycle - some improvement. The newer environmental regulatory scheme seems to hinge on scrapping the more accurate survey which was being done in UPA 2 in favor of a more lenient metric. Standard policy to allow stronger resource extraction.

Government workers working harder - meh, I'm obviously looking beyond the hype and waiting to see the core reforms which they will help. Reducing paper work matters more- which is happening. 
I have to see how this actually impacts the market though, so I can't say anything about it.

Tax restructuring - I think there's some rumbling on the double taxation agreements, let's see how that pans out. Knowing policy direction, I expect it to improve capital inflow into the country. 



Military expenditure - expect this to become a big part of the economy. India is probably going to start fielding an army several times larger than it's needs. (Politics is way too good here. Wrap up the military vote , appeal to the core demographic, create jobs, move foreign policy into a more party preferred direction) :: maybe several percent of GDP here.

36,"Mandating maximum times for file clearances is funny. The BJP aren't fans of regulations. Why is that applicable only to government regulations ON business, and not government regulations ON government?

I remember candidate Modi talking about how there was an archaic rule on the quantity of fuel approved for each government vehicle, per month - in some ministry (telecom I think). This was the same for vehicles in the plains, as well as those in the Eastern hill states. He portrayed that as absurd. (Sidetracking: It needn't be absurd. Poorer mileage could be offset by lower commute distances. There's always nuance).

I'm citing that to caution against having such broad-brush rules - on things as large as infrastructure/industrial projects! Due diligence on various things is going to take some time! Make it mandatory to do things IN A MONTH(!), and you'll have things slipping through the cracks - ""haste makes waste style"". Blame apportionment - and calling a bureaucrat/government incompetent isn't going to work either. Environmental effects can take years to show... by which time the political potency of this clearance issue would've decayed.

*(Of course, I'm assuming that the MoEF people were already working hard).*

But I'm not *only* complaining. For instance, I'd fully support a move which mandated that a company could requisition a copy of the government memo associated with their pending file (to ascertain what specific issue was being debated in the govt. that day). This allows companies to follow up, requires the ministry officials to document their concerns, and remain on their toes - while still respecting the differences of various cases; and the different time and effort required to process each case. **A specific regulation - aimed at the style of working, at the process, rather than the deliverable end results of that work.**",2014-08-30 15:53:27

How is working with a time bound, TAT driven system a ""regulation"", it is the defacto way of working. I assume (probability and all) that you work for the private sector organisation, and in your org, every activity, task you do is time bound with an escalation matrix for your customers (clients) to follow if you are in breach of that.

What is wrong with saying, within 4 weeks you need to tell the applicant if it is a yes or a no...not like say POSCO which has not been told a yes or a no for 9 years now.

Sorry but if things are done in a rule based, binary way (which is how any government should be run) and not in the usual Babu way of discretionary bs, there won't be any issues with due diligence failing.

Keep one thing in mind, India ranks abysmally low in the Ease of doing business rankings - Papua New Guinea, Swaziland, Kiribati, Ethiopia, Maldives, Namibia, Zambnia, Mongolia are but a few stellar nations which are above or way above us in rankings. Why even our bete noire Pakistan is at a healthy (relatively) 110, Bangladesh is higher - we languish at 134, of these, our sub ranking in ease of starting a business is at 179 out of 189 nations, yes, we are that fuckin poor that Libya or war torn Sudan rate higher than us, well we have only some 10 below us, so that is pretty much the whole world ahead of us.

This should tell you (along with what we have seen in our own media) that something is fundamentally fucked up somewhere.

&gt;Of course, I'm assuming that the MoEF people were already working hard)

Which Utopian world are you living in? Does it take 9 years (again taking POSCO) to study whatever it is that needs to be studied to arrive at an answer (be it yes or no).

&gt;But I'm not only complaining. For instance, I'd fully support a move which mandated that a company could requisition a copy of the government memo associated with their pending file (to ascertain what specific issue was being debated in the govt. that day).

NDA II has taken this a step further, it is putting things (as with Gujarat govt) online for anybody to follow. 

Till now, the only way one could find out where the fuck your file was stuck (and not the file) was via filing an RTI which the department concerned might or might not respond to in a truthful manner. Another move by Modi is that any form of instruction / discussion like emails are allowed to move files, not notate a single file with a green pen by a babu who works 5 hours a day.

Not sure if you have engaged the bureaucracy and tried starting a business, but my dad has and we went fuckin bankrupt thanks to the government.

In 1987 he put in Rs 1 crore of his, borrowed another crore and tried...operational word is tried to start a pharma manufacturing business. 318 clearances were required, many of it required (Almost all of it) bribes, and unfortunately my dad is a very principled guy and he refused flat out to pay bribes.

The plant went operational in 1998 (11 years later, despite us having every single documentation that the government wanted), just to give you an idea of the hold up's - this was in a Central govt run Central Pharma SEZ (cluster), and despite this, the TNPCB (TN Pollution Control Board) was involved as they had to issue the clearance for pollution controls - they took 7 years...7 FUCKING YEARS (And approx 100 visits by my dad / colleagues in this period).

After all these delays, fuckin project was not viable and we had to fold. Took my family 10 years to recover from the loss. On the other hand, Orchid pharma which was started at the EXACT same day as ours, got the clearances (they had a smaller budget) and was up and running in 3 years.

&gt;

&gt;__Ramdhari Sinha (Singh) 'Dinkar'__ (23 September 1908 – 24 April 1974) was an [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi) poet, essayist, patriot and academic,   who is considered as one of the most important modern Hindi poets. He remerged as a poet of rebellion as a consequence of his nationalist poetry written in the days before [Indian independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence). His poetry exuded *veer [rasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_(art\))*, and he has been hailed as a *[Rashtrakavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrakavi)* (""National poet"") on account of his inspiring patriotic compositions. 

&gt;The present [Prime Minister of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India), [Narendra Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi) wrote a message appreciating the translation of [Rashmirathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashmirathi) into [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) by the [Mauritian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritian) cultural activist Leela Gujadhur Sarup.  As a mark of respect for him, his portrait was unveiled in the Central Hall of [Parliament of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) by the then [Prime Minister of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India), [Dr. Manmohan Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Manmohan_Singh) on his centenary year, 2008.   On 23 November 2012, the [President of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_India), [Pranab Mukherjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranab_Mukherjee) gave away Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar' Sahitya Ratna Samman to 21 prominent writers and social workers at a function organised in [Rashtrapati Bhavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrapati_Bhavan).  On the occasion, the President recalled the contribution of Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar' in the freedom struggle and his service to Hindi literature.  Poet and former [Prime Minister of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India), [Atal Bihari Vajpayee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee) spoke of Dinkarji in high esteem.  Others who have praised his literary genius include [Shivraj Patil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivraj_Patil), [Lal Krishna Advani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Krishna_Advani), [Somnath Chatterjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnath_Chatterjee), [Gulab Khandelwal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulab_Khandelwal), [Bhawani Prasad Mishra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhawani_Prasad_Mishra), and [Seth Govind Das](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Govind_Das). 

&gt;Dinkar initially supported the revolutionary movement during the [Indian independence struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement), but later became a [Gandhian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhian). However, he used to call himself a 'Bad Gandhian' because he supported the feelings of indignation and revenge among the youth.  In *Kurukshetra*, he accepted that war is destructive but argued that it is necessary for the protection of freedom. He was close to prominent nationalists of the time such as [Rajendra Prasad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasad), [Anugrah Narayan Sinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anugrah_Narayan_Sinha), [Sri Krishna Sinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Krishna_Sinha), [Rambriksh Benipuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambriksh_Benipuri) and Braj Kishore Prasad.

&gt;Under the aegis of the highly-educated officials who ran the Planning Commission was created the worst social and physical infrastructure in the developing world. While they planned badly for the average Indian, they planned very well for themselves. Their children went to the best foreign universities while Indian students struggled to get into college even after getting 95 per cent marks. They went to the best foreign hospitals when they got sick, while the average Indian was forced to rely on private doctors because public healthcare was so abysmal. These are things that should have been analysed by us political pundits, but instead we have mostly heard the voices of those who mourn the end of Nehruvian socialism. Why? Could it be because the media continues to treat Narendra Modi as a pariah in Lutyens Delhi — an usurper who does not deserve to spend even 100 days in this exalted space?

I doubt she has any understanding of why all those lofty plans were executed so miserably (read : inadequately). Or if she does, it would be detrimental to her stance.

103,"&gt;In his later years in the RSS, an organization known to take pride in its barebones approach to physical appearance, Modi’s self-indulgent fastidiousness in matters of attire was a cause of not a little discomfort.
Today, of course, Modi’s sense of refinement goes beyond clothing—he sports Bvlgari glasses, wields a Mont Blanc pen, and wears linen kurtas stitched at Jade Blue. Incidentally, when Mukhopadhyay meets Modi’s tailor in Ahmedabad, he makes it a point to ascertain the politician’s exact chest size, and goes so far as to confirm that it is not the 56 inches his devotees would have you believe, but sadly shies away from sharing with us the correct measurement. He notes, however, that Modi carries a “special shaving comb” for his beard, and underwent a hair transplant that enabled him to “reclaim part of his receding hairline and appear less bald for the December (2007) election campaign.”

118,"we have NO English heritage. It was just a predatory business based relationships that was attempted to be portrayed as gentrification of the natives. However, even the most charitable attitude towards the British shall come from some of the liberal elite who answer in ""Railways"" and ""English based school system"" before coming all over themselves.

Having traveled quite a bit in South America, especially in Chile/Peru, I feel that while the British fucked us pretty bad, and impoverished us in every which way imaginable - they did (EDIT: Tried but could not) not break our *national spirit*, if you will. For right or wrong, the influence of British is largely academic outside of a few silly areas such as cricket, tea and English language. They also gave us a fucked up Victorian ""morality"" disguised as ""Indian culture"" which we are trying desperately to overcome. There has been a constant push by Indian intellectuals (especially those who are unapologetic about OUR heritage) to celebrate and bring to the forefront the splendid nature of our history and philosophy. 

In South America, I felt the presence of the SPANISH even now, every day. In your food, in your language, in your religion, in your governance - EVERYWHERE. See, we have British food (tea / sliced bread etc.), English, Christianity, Anglo-Indians and what not. But in Latin America, I kept getting bemused by how little original Chilean monuments were on display. Sure, the hike to Machu Pichu is great, but why is it still just a trek and nothing more than that? What about ancient festivals and not just Christmas. I also felt a *very* strong correlation between top businessmen and government officials, and a ""direct Spanish blood"" linkage. A very high percentage of big wigs are blondes with blue eyes, and I have heard the ""motherland"" talk from them a lot more. 

India is very different. We are still early in a journey to truly find and fix ourselves to a past (or a brand new) glory, but our heroes whether [Dhirubhai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani), or [Murthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._R._Narayana_Murthy) or [Ratan Tata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratan_Tata) or (too early to say) [Modi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi) or [Abdul Kalam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam) are going to be as Indian as they come. Our doors are open to Indians of British heritage such as [Ruskin Bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruskin_Bond), and [Mark Tully](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Tully) but just because they feel fairly ""Indian"" at this point of time, and not because we feel they are any superior to us.

I had read many things about Pandit Nehru and Gandhi family in my textbooks, only good things. I had never read anything that exposed their misdeeds. When I had read about the Independence movement in history books, it was portrayed as if everybody was enchanted by Gandhi and they never had any ideological differences. As if Patel and Nehru were just two brothers sharing common thoughts. I had always seen names of Gandhi, Ambedkar, Bose etc taken in one breath, and their pictures on the same banners. It's only latter I learnt how ideologically apart they were. And there were times when they downright hated each other. 

Also, dis-respect and respect should not equal support or opposition. I don't like Indira Gandhi, because of emergancy and how she reduced Congress to bootlicker's party. But I can't deny the fact that her diplomacy was an important factor in the war of 1971. I like Modi. Fuck it, I am a Bhakt through and through.

&gt;That Was Not Funny Mr Modi!
VISHNU SHARMA


&gt;NEW DELHI: My friend Laxman knew better than most of us what bullying was. His father worked in Pahalwans fields, a small time landlord of our town with a penchant for bullying people dependent on him or weaker. Pahalwan also ran a tea shop. The tea shop was the place, where grown up people of our locality met and talked.

&gt;When Laxman was 13, Pahalwan asked his father to send him to work in his shop after school. Laxman’s work was to wash dishes and server tea. Seldom, we would go to the shop to meet Laxman. Due to the work, he had become irregular in the playground where we used to play in the evenings.

&gt;Many a times, we saw Pahalwan and other bullying Laxman. Pahalwan would hold his ears and role them. ‘ye dekho Ganapati ka chuha’, one day we heard him mocking Laxman. Often, we too would become part of that regular dose of fun. We were too young to understand how Laxman was taking it. Later, we too started doing the same with Laxman. The tallest and the heaviest of us would caught hold of Laxman’s ears and make him Ganapati. We would laugh holding our pants. Those giggles cost Laxman too much. He started avoiding us. One Monday, the day PahalwaN kept his shop closed, Laxman didn’t come to play. As he was the most sought-after player, the curiosity was obvious.

&gt;When his absence became regular, we knew something was wrong. One Monday we went to meet him in his house. We found him playing with his sisters. He couldn’t convincingly tell us why he stopped coming to play. He just said that he had lost interest. Sometimes after, he left school too. His father told our teacher that Laxman cried every time he was told to go to school.

&gt;Soon we forgot Laxman. I don’t know how is he now but I know that it was bullying of Pahalwan and us that took him away from us. Who knows what he would have become had we not bullied him? After all he wasn’t lacking anything. Only thing that had saved us from suffering the fate of Laxman, perhaps, was that we survived Pahalwan’s bullying. By bullying Laxman, Pahalwan had set a trend. He had made Laxman a clown for others too. Now there is no Laxman in our town but Ganapati. Often people see him dancing in the processions against crowd cheering, ‘wah Ganapati, shabash’.

&gt;I have lived and relived Laxman a thousand times. His fate is a realization for me what bullying can do. It breaks children’s confidence. In India, there are many Laxmans who are bullied every minute for sadist pleasure of mentally sick people. When PM Modi, held the ears of the boy in a temple in Japan and made fun of him I was taken back in time. I saw myself standing in front of Pahalwans shop watching Laxman being bullied.

Even if Modi does not want to do that, people would go for it. **In the United States the civil war started roughly around hundredth year of its independence. So, I have a feeling, here also around seventieth year after the independence, there will be a civil war.** Because, they could oppress the backwards and others when they did not have education at all, there was no organic intellectual, nobody to speak, no TV, no phone, nothing. They were in the forests and villages, they did not know what the state was, who was in power. Now the situation has changed.

Please read the full article. There are important several key points from Modi's speech but the only thing they found worthy of the headline was this. Not points like these,

&gt;They also agreed to speed up talks on a so-far elusive deal on nuclear energy cooperation, welcoming what they called ""significant progress"" in the negotiations.

That doesn't count as a source, hope you realise it. 

&gt;The non-Muslim butchers practice jhatka which severs the head in one clean blow. Which is probably painless since the brain drains of blood almost immediately. 

This article suggests otherwise.

&gt;Halal involves a swipe with a sharp blade across the animal's neck, severing the windpipe, jugular vein and carotid artery. Contrary to popular belief, Dr Modi, who trains butchers in the art of slaughtering at the institute's abattoir, says evidence suggests that animals slaughtered through jhatka suffer more trauma than those killed by halal. ""The less an animal struggles, the better the meat. When animals face trauma, the glycogen content in their muscles is activated, leaving the meat tough. Stored glycogen is the agent that leads to rigor mortis (or, stiffening of muscles on death),"" Dr Modi says.

Mathematics or rather the history of it should be used by our society to show people that we were once leaders in research, that our culture has some value. We can get there again, we need to push in the one direction. We, the Indian people, are not just the sum of the British occupation of the subcontinent. We are more, we can achieve more. We have in the past. Wake up and get cracking....

Your stance is rather foolish. Do all the americans gloating about their country going first to the moon know rocket science or astro physics? It is a thing of pride that motivates people on. The moon landing spurred on so many americans to be the best that they could be. The sense of achievement was palpable. That their culture, their civilisation could leave this planet and land on another heavenly body led more students to get into science. A celebration of American exceptionalism followed for the next two to three decades and had many positive repercussions on their society besides just the development of rocket science and astrophysics.

276,"&gt; Part of ruling is motivating his people.

I never questioned the logic of giving speeches and motivating people.

&gt;Was his Aug 15th speech propaganda?

Neither I, nor government official were asked to sit in their office at night, way after the normal timings, and listen to telecasted speech of PM and get motivated. It was everyone's choice to watch or not watch the telecasted speech as he deemed fit. I personally spent entire morning sleeping like I would do on any other holiday. I caught up with his speech when I woke up and liked it. But that is beside the point.

&gt;Have you seen the text of this speech? Is it propaganda if he tells the kids to work hard and do India proud? Why must everything be ""propaganda""?

Propoganda is not in telling what, propaganda is in telling how. If on independence day I was asked to sit in office and listen to his speech, no matter what he said it would feel like propaganda.

&gt;What kind of asinine logic is this? Did the PM / CM's fight for our independance? So no speeches on Aug 15th. Did they help in drafting our constitution? So no speeches on Republic day. Do they go and fight in the frontlines? So no speeches to the army at all...so on and so forth.

Independence day is a national day and for entire country. It is natural that the leader of the nation will address the nation and put forward his vision/agenda. But teachers day is completely different. It is between Teachers and students. It is not a national day. It is just a tradition. Good on him that he thinks highly of this day but addressing every kid in country is not the way to celebrate it. 

&gt;Technically though, he heads the govt, the HRD minister who heads all teachers in all state run unis reports into him, so you could say when it comes to teachers, the buck stops with him.

This logic is as asinine as they come. Technically he is everything in country, doesn't mean he actually is. Now what? Should Srinivasan(comparison with post and not person) be lecturing Indian cricket team on how to perform well. He leads BCCI, so technically he is the head of the team ain't he? If there was Gavankar in Srinivasan's place and he lectured Indian team on cricket and playing for the nation etc. it would make sense wouldn't it?

321,"The paragraph I cared most about:

&gt;The government has not yet revealed any blue print as to how it will revitalise agriculture. Can the Modi government get agriculture moving at 5-6% for the next 10 years? States such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, etc, have achieved more than 7% growth per annum over a long period, from 2001-02 to 2012-13. Can that magic work at an all-India level? When will the agriculture ministry focus on Modi’s slogan ‘per drop, more crop’? Also, in its manifesto, the BJP had promised to raise the profitability in agriculture to 50% above cost. How will it do that? Surely, it needs much more time for the government to come up with its action plan to respond to these questions. But some movement in that direction should be visible, which seems to be missing so far. Controlling food inflation seems to have pre-occupied the attention of the Modi government, at least for now, and it has succeeded in minimising the damage despite poor monsoon.

Close to 12,000 farmers have committed suicide in the past decade and millions more are stuck on a cycle of debt and misery. We add 15 million kids a year into the job market and the only sector that can place them is manufacturing which is seeing negative growth. Our military is in a shambles. We need to invest in a trillion dollars worth of infrastructure just in our urban areas to make it livable...but no, #prod warrior on Reddit is bothered by meat sales.

* Will the govt take concrete steps for population control.

&gt;The __2002 Gujarat riots__, also known as __2002 Gujarat violence__ and the __Gujarat pogrom__,   was a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the [western Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_India) state of [Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat). Following the initial incident there were further outbreaks of violence in [Ahmedabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad) for three weeks; statewide, there were further outbreaks of [mass killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Muslim_violence_in_India) against the minority Muslim population for three months.   The [burning of a train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra_train_burning) in [Godhra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra) on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims and religious workers returning from [Ayodhya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya), is believed to have triggered the violence.   Some commentators, however, hold the view that the attacks had been pre-planned, were well orchestrated, and that the attack on the train was a ""staged trigger"" for what was actually premeditated violence.

There never was a problem with the power that Sonia enjoyed per se. The problem was she enjoyed absolute power with zero responsibility. The responsibility was thrust onto a puppet. Say what you will about Modi, but he bears a responsibility commensurate to his power. 

Besides, there is a massive difference in the way both acquired that power. Modi got that kind of power because he led his party to the biggest Lok Sabha victory in over 20 years.

Consolidating power in the party is wrong how? You want the Govt and Party (like in the UPA) to work at cross purposes? Also in case you didn't know, 

* Sushma Swaraj has gone up against him in the past [by allying](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/sushma-swaraj-hits-the-road-without-a-mention-of-narendra-modi/) with Advani. 
* [Smriti Irani](https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=smriti%20irani%20fast%20against%20modi) once went on a fast unto death demanding Modi's resignation. 
* [Uma Bharati](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dV1fBJ6ECI) called Modi a Vinas Purush or agent of destruction.

All these people (and maybe more) have more than just had a dissenting opinion, yet are all part of his cabinet. Seems like the exact opposite of what you are saying. Yet in INC if a leader dare say that Sonia or Pappu are wrong - that is it, they are out in the wilderness never to return

&gt;all the party members act like his servile slaves

Please point out ONE senior minister (or any BJP worker in a national capacity and not some random worker in Jumritaliya) who has behaved or continues to behave like a Sibal, PC, Aiyar, Jayanthi or any of Sonia's minions doing anything even remotely critical of Sonia, Pappu or even the long dead Smt Indiraji?

The main issue people who railed at the ""Italian Bitch"" have is manifold.

* She has next to no skills. If the erstwhile family retainer Natwar Singh is to be believed she would ""practice"" speeches for days...One speech mind you, and her speeches are always very short. She till 1991 had next to no experience in running a party, let alone a country. Contrast this with Modi. He started small, worked his way up the party cadre, ran a state (Very successfully) for 12 years before becoming PM.

* She held power without accountability - Every single fuck up of the UPA would be placed on MMS. Even the election disaster, you had cronies lining up to take the blame. She and her brood have ZERO accountability and this should scare any Indian irrespective of what party you support or don't support. Now look at Modi, till December 2012 he was not even sure if he would be the PM candidate. If BJP lost the elections or even won only 180 odd seats, Modi would be on his way to political extinction....unlike Sonia Barmaid Gandhi who is still being protected by her cronies.

* She denigrated the office of the President (by placing turds like Pratibha Patil) and the PM (by controlling his every move). You might hate Modi, you might hate the BJP but you I guess are still Indian. The President is above all, the PM is THE head of the govt....but this bitch insulted all these positions by treating them like some family servant.

* She is not Indian and yet controlled the lives of a billion people. She did not even give a shit about active politics or Indians or even take an Indian passport till her husband died.

What part of ""taking on all responsibility but no accountability and using a extra constitutional post called the NAC to subvert every single constitutional authority we Indians respect"" don't you get?

Such innocent lambs Sonia, Rahul and Vadra are. Am sure she is not corrupt at all. 

Which explains why the first act of UPA was to get interpol to remove the red flag notice on Quattarochi and unfreeze his assets. Am sure Robert Vadra is the most honest person (after Kejriwal) and only via his exceptional business acumen was he able to turn 50 Lakhs into 1,000 crores in 4 years.

Don't forget she held supreme control over the party and govt and is fully accountable for every single Rs looted in her regime. 

Though am sure apologists like you are already spinning it as MMS ka govt, MMS ka accountability. It is very evident here. The fact that a great leader like PVN was mercilessly booted out despite winning 180 seats but mother and son still being genuflected to after taking congress to its absolute low tells me ask that I need to know.

&gt; I assume it is because you see her as a foreigner or maybe you do not like the fact that she is a Christian.

Yeah the fact that she ran without any constitutional powers and accountability, the most corrupt govt in Indian history and treated the highest posts in t the land as her own family serfdom has nothing to do with it. As also the fact that aside from the fact that she slept with the right Gandhi she has no other qualifications to run a nation of 1 billion all have nothing to do with it...but go on, spin it into a religious thing.

* Questions were sorta 50/50. There were some questions that were just a waste of time (like the kind who asked how one can become a PM like Modi). Then, again I think these were just cases of teachers restricting the question askers to adarsh balaks and gave them the most reasonable question they could think of that wasn't too hard. 

* Modi had so many childhood incidents to refer to. I think 'Modi ka bachpan' might be something thats gonna get published.

* ""chunni staple kar deta tha""LoL

&gt; At one level, this ought not to surprise us. We know, for example, from the 'do your rajdharma' advice Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave him in 2002 that Modi was seen as someone who forgets or is unsure about what the duty and obligations of a ruler really entail.

Sometime or the other, we have to move towards the direction of saving electricity.....He also cited an example of families teaching their children to apologise mother Earth for causing her pain before putting their feet on the ground when they wake up in the morning.

469,"&gt;&gt;    So, Hindus would have to accept the slaughter of cows, which they consider sacred (some Indian states have banned cow slaughter); the Muslim community’s perceived infatuation with Pakistan; the conversion of poor, low-caste Hindus to Christianity by evangelists; and the near impossibility of getting admitted to some prestigious schools and colleges run by Christian organizations because so many places are reserved for Christian students.

&gt;Source

&gt;Ever imagined how the Hindus might feel that despite they being the majority for all of India's history, the Prime Minister of the nation has to look over his shoulder before gifting a book that the entire world acknowledges as work of enduring significance that originated from this very land?

Let me address each point:

- Slaughter of cows.

    Do you know in how many states cow slaughter is banned? Except in my home state of Kerala, I do not think it is legal in most other states. Except maybe in states like Goa and the North-East. Even in Kerala, most Hindus eat beef.

- Muslim's infatuation with Pakistan.

    In general you cannot force someone to be patriotic. If a citizen likes/respects his country or its fellow citizens, he will tend to be patriotic. It cannot be forced. I have met many Muslims who are patriotic. I have also met Muslims who support Pakistan. I would say it is not much different from Indian Hindus supporting Pakistani Hindus over other Indians of other religions. 

- Conversion of poor, low-caste Hindus to Christianity

    The higher caste Hindus are quite welcome to convert them to upper caste Hindus. Remove the caste system. Respect human beings irrespective of class/caste. Instead of treating them like shit. You can refer some of the posts on /r/India to get my point. 'Dalits students wrist slashed for wearing a watch', 'boycott of Dalit', 'rape of Dalit girl' etc. Solve this and this problem is solved.

- Admission to Christian colleges

    Maybe Hindu orgarnizations such as RSS/VHP should get their priorities right and start similar prestigious schools and colleges. Instead of attacking minorities all the time. But they seem to have different priorities.

&gt; Prime Minister of the nation has to look over his shoulder before gifting a book that the entire world acknowledges as work of enduring significance that originated from this very land?

That was just the Prime Minister trying to manufacture a controversy, and almost everyone reading this comment knows it. Neither me nor anyone who you would call 'secular' would have criticized it and we all know that. Yes, some idiot like Arnab might use it to up his TRP ratings. But nobody who has half a brain would endorse it. If you suggest so, it is just intellectual dishonesty on your part.

&gt; Communal Violence Bill - Hindus caught even in crossfire in a riot will be presumed to be guilty until proven innocent, and the onus of proving innocence will be on those Hindus! 

I have not heard of this. Could you please provide a source?

&gt;&gt; If there is a post in which a Muslim has committed a crime, there will be a huge number of comments, such as 'religion of peace', 'muslims are bad', 'send them to Pakistan' etc.

&gt; Francis Xavier said a lot of bad things about Hindus and their way of life. And to this day Christians venerate him. Does that mean you're responsible for all of that?

Do you *really* mean that? It's all-out on r/India, man. Anyway, here:

&gt; Talking to journalists later, Modi said climate change was a subject close to his heart, referring to his book on tackling climate change 'Convenient Action'. ""Look at the US. They used to be dependent on Middle East oil, now they are a net exporter of energy. That's where we want to be,"" he said. He added that the environment versus development debate should not be seen through a western perspective but from an Indian point of view. 

[Source](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Narendra-Modi-gives-mantra-to-take-on-China/articleshow/36265685.cms)

&gt; 'Convenient Action - Gujarat's Response to Challenges of Climate Change' ,the book penned by Chief Minister Narendra Modi,received rave reviews from former president A P J Abdul Kalam and R K Pachauri,the co-recipient of Nobel Prize.

&gt; Presiding over the book launch at Tagore Hall here on Tuesday,Dr Kalam advised Modi to pioneer initiatives to make Gujarat a carbon-neutral state by 2030 and said he saw the book as a source of inspiration for other states.

&gt; Kalam said that after reading the book,he believed a carbon-neutral state was possible to achieve. The former president was also all praise for the Sabarmati Riverfront Project which he held as an inspiration for the nation in desilting.

&gt; As the guest of honour,The Energy Research Institute (TERI) director Dr Pachauri said Modis book went beyond describing the problem of climate change and suggested actions to be taken in a well-documented form. Pachauri said Modi had attended a training programme at TERI to study climate change issues like a student earlier.

&gt; Speaking on the occasion,Modi said the ecological debt should not be passed on to future generations. He said environmental concerns were not a new thing and that his book would throw light on tackling them.

&gt; The chief minister said the approach to the problem would turn the tables just like the World Bank was forced to change its position in the case of Gujarat wherein it first refused help on Narmada project funding and then did an aboutturn to confer green award to the state.

&gt; Modi said while tackling the challenge of climate change,the focus should be on climate justice. He said that in his letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,he had suggested that other states be told to emulate the pioneering action taken by Gujarat in handling the crisis as the result of climate change.

&gt; He said the humankind had a right only to milk natural resources and not to exploit them.

477,"&gt;It is amusing how you right-wingers manage to feel so persecuted despite being the majority in this country.

It is ironically the ""Seculiberals"" who think there is a fuck ton of rightwing persecution happening in this country.

&gt;Assuming you live in a city, go to the Muslim majority areas there. They would be the poorest, slum-iest areas in your city. I have been to Mumbai and Bangalore and witnessed this first-hand

Ok, and your point is? Has anybody denied this? Also this country has had a Muslim from the slums reach the heights of presidency. We also likewise have millions of tribals and Hindus languishing in massive poverty. What are is your non-point here?

&gt;The majority of Muslims I have met are hardworking, honest, decent people.

Ok, and who denies this? See, you seem to have drawn this massive strawman in your head about what the ""right wing' perceives and you attack it ceaselessly.

&gt;Yes, there are crappy, criminals among them. But the right-wing here wants to project them as the representative of all Muslims. This bullshit has been increasing ever since the BJP has come to power.

Now we come to the ""seculiberal"" victim mentality. No, sorry nobody is saying all Muslims are evil or criminal scum, but we constantly say that as a religion Islam has deep structural flaws (and now will come the Tu-Quoque with links to some Manusmriti portal) and that Islam has to fix it. Problem with you ""seculiberals"" is that you think, calling out the violent aspects of Islam is tantamount to hating Muslims.

On the other hand, ""seculiberals"" in the name of being ""secular"" are willing to whitewash any religion motivated crime done by Muslims as...""hate crimes, political motives etc"", whereas if a Hindu lunatic does the same it becomes ""Hindoo Nazis on the rampage"". Case in point how the Saharanpur riots were treated or how the Meerut incident was treated or the MASSIVE silence on the 7 (and counting) murders of Hindu org workers by Muslims in TN.

&gt;Another post, in which the criminal is a Hindu, there will be absolute zero mention of religion. Says a lot about the hypocrisy of you guys.

Au contraire - Pune Techies incident was blown up as an act of all Hindus ganging up against that poor Muslim guy who was killed. 7 Hindu Org workers slaughtered in TN and...it is a crime by a few select individuals belonging to a certain minority community.

This is visible even on our randia threads -a dear Mod for any such ""Hindu Nazi"" crime will have no hesitation in saying ""Fucking Hindutva nutjobs""...but if it is a case like where that Sharia made a women the mother to her own husband it is ""damn Religious nutjobs"".

The hypocrisy implicit in your own posts is stunning.

I railed against Sonia Gandhi, gave multiple reasons (chief amongst them on how she subverted every constitutional authority we hold dear), and the only thing you read (incorrectly was), is her profession as Barmaid offensive to you and is it her religion yet you have no qualms in calling Modi a chai wallah quite derisively, you state no other reasons for why you at the least dislike him. So could I assume that you hate his religion and caste in the same puerile manner you did to me?

So is the Christian world completely homogeneous? Have Christians never fought battles amongst themselves? The point is that a false picture of utopia existing within Christianity is painted to induce these people to convert. And, that Christian proselytizers often preach very negative message about Hinduism is a well-known fact.

&gt; Maybe Hindu orgarnizations such as RSS/VHP should get their priorities right and start similar prestigious schools and colleges. Instead of attacking minorities all the time. But they seem to have different priorities.

It's all about money. Christian groups in India receive massive funds collected from the ordinary, unsuspecting public in the West [who are told](http://www.religioustolerance.org/sbc_pray2.htm) they will be funding good work in India. Would you endorse such things?

The antics of the *p*seculars have become very predictable, which is what Modi anticipated very well. And that is [exactly what happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2f9vr3/haha_modi_was_right_secular_parties_have_started/).
