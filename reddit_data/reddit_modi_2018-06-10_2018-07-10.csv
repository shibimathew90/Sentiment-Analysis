**In 2017, India moved to top 10 FDI-hosting economies** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India has moved up a notch to enter the top 10

foreign direct investment

(FDI) host economies in 2017 despite the challenging condition of

global FDI flows

.

According to the

World Investment Report 2018

, global flows of foreign direct investment fell by 23% in 2017, largely due
to contraction across developed economies.

FDI flows across developing economies, especially in Asia have remained
stable, even though the growth has been flat, according to the commerce
ministry.

‚Äú2018 is slated to be a tough year with the slowing pace of international
production and stagnation of growth in GVCs. Having said that, the Ministry of
Commerce &amp;amp; Industry working on critical aspects such as modernising
existing bilateral, multilateral and plurilateral treaties, and releasing the
new industrial policy focussed on making the Indian industry future ready,‚Äù a
statement from the ministry said.

Data released on Friday showed foreign direct inflows into India rose 3% to
$62 billion during 2017-18, the slowest pace of expansion since the Narendra
Modi government came to office four years ago.

FDI

inflows during the previous financial year were estimated at a shade over $60
billion.

of India at the critical position of a Joint Secretary. The

Narendra Modi

government has opened ten such positions for 'lateral entry'.

The selected individuals will be given three-year-contracts extendable to five
years based on performance in key ministries and given the pay scale of a
Joint Secretary which is from Rs 1.44 lakh to Rs 2.18 lakh per month plus

areas of Revenue, Financial Services, Economic Affairs, Agriculture,
Cooperation &amp;amp; Farmers‚Äô Welfare, Road Transport &amp;amp; Highways, Shipping,
Environment, Forests and Climate Change, New &amp;amp; Renewable Energy, Civil

Indian nationals willing to contribute towards nation building to join the
Government at the level of Joint Secretary. Joint Secretaries are at a crucial
level of senior management in the Government. They lead policy making as well
as implementation of various programmes and schemes of the Department assigned
to them. Joint Secretaries report to the Secretary/Additional Secretary in the
Ministry/Department,"" the government has said.

Officers of any State or UT Government who are already working at equivalent
level or are eligible for appointment to equivalent level in their cadre, with
relevant experience are eligible to apply along with individuals working at
comparable levels in

(PSUs), Autonomous Bodies, Statutory Organisations, Universities and
Recognized Research Institutes with a minimum of 15 years experience.

""Individuals working at comparable levels in Private Sector Companies,
Consultancy Organisations, International/Multinational Organisations with a

All appointees shall be deemed to be Public Servants for the purpose of the
CCS (Conduct) Rules and such other Statutes as notified by the Government from

**Currency With Public Reaches Rs 18.5 Lakh Crore: RBI Data** 

 ______ 
Before demonetisation, the currency with the public stood at about Rs 17 lakh
crore. (File)

**New Delhi: **

Currency with the public has reached a record high level of over Rs 18.5 lakh
crore, more than double from a low of about Rs 7.8 lakh crore it had hit post-
demonetisation decision in late 2016, as per RBI data.

At the same time, the total currency put in circulation by the Reserve Bank
has also more than doubled to over Rs 19.3 lakh crore -- from a low of about
Rs 8.9 lakh crore post- demonetisation.

Currency with the public is arrived at after deducting cash with banks from
total currency in circulation.

This high level of currency available with the public is in sharp contrast to
the reported cash crunch in various parts of the country a few months ago.
There has been a fear that hoarding or accumulation of large amounts of cash
for various reasons could have triggered an artificial currency crunch.

The figures for both 'currency with the public' and 'currency in circulation'
have also exceeded the levels seen before the government's demonetisation
decision on November 8, 2016, that saw nearly 86 per cent of the currency in
circulation at that time being invalidated overnight by scrapping the then Rs
500/1,000 banknotes.

The public was given time to deposit the invalidated notes in banks, which saw
nearly 99 per cent of banned notes coming back into the system.

As per the RBI's latest disclosure in this regard, people had returned Rs
15.28 lakh crore as on June 30, 2017, of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore banned
currency, or 98.96 per cent, of the scrapped notes to the banking system.

Since then, the RBI has introduced new denominations of Rs 2,000 and Rs 200,
among others, besides a new Rs 500 note. After the recent cash crunch, the
government had announced that printing of Rs 500 notes would be stepped up.

While the RBI is yet to announce its final word on processing and verification
of all the returned notes, the latest 'money supply' data from the central
bank puts the ""currency with the public"" at over Rs 18.5 lakh crore as on May
25, 2018 -- up more than 31 per cent from year-ago level.

This is an over two-fold jump from Rs 7.8 lakh crore as on December 9, 2016 --
the lowest level it had seen after the announcement of the demonetisation
decision as people rushed to deposit the scrapped notes with banks and the
RBI.

Prior to demonetisation, the currency with the public stood at about Rs 17
lakh crore.

In terms of 'currency in circulation', the RBI puts the latest figure at over
Rs 19.3 lakh crore as on June 1, 2018 -- again a jump of about 30 per cent
from the year-ago level, according to the 'reserve money' data released by the
central bank.

This also marks an over two-fold rise from a low of Rs 8.9 lakh crore as on
January 6, 2017 -- the lowest level it saw post-demonetisation. The current
level of currency in circulation is also above the pre-demonetisation figure
of Rs 17.9 lakh crore as on November 5, 2016.

The RBI publishes the figures for currency in circulation on a weekly basis,
while the currency with the public comes out every fortnight.

An analysis of historic data shows that the currency with the public stood at
about Rs 13 lakh crore before the Modi government took charge in May 2014.

It rose to over Rs 14.5 lakh crore in a year and then further to close to Rs
16.7 lakh crore by May 2016. The figure crossed Rs 17 lakh crore level by
October that year, before starting to decline due to demonetisation.

The figure again came back above Rs 10 lakh crore by February 2017 and crossed
Rs 15 lakh crore mark in September last year.

A similar trend was seen in the currency in circulation figure, which dropped
sharply from November 2016 till early January 2017 due to demonetisation,
before starting to go up.

The total money supply, described as M3 by the RBI, now stands at over Rs 140
lakh crore -- nearly 11 per cent higher than the year-ago level. It stood at
about Rs 120 lakh crore during the demonetisation period and was below Rs 100
lakh crore level before the Modi government came to power.

The M3 includes currency with the public, deposit money of the public (demand
deposits with the banking system plus 'other' deposits with the RBI) and the
time deposits with the banking system.

__ Comments

This figure is equivalent to the net bank credit to the government, plus the
bank credit to the commercial sector, plus net foreign exchange assets of the
banking sector, plus government's currency liabilities to the public, minus
the net non-monetary liabilities of the banking sector.

The government's currency liabilities to the public comprise rupee coins and
small coins.

**Private Sector Professionals Can Be Bureaucrats, 10 Senior Posts Open** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government had opened up entry for professionals in 10
senior posts.

**New Delhi: **

The Narendra Modi government has now opened the doors of bureaucracy to
skilled people from the private sector, inviting applications for 10 senior-
level posts. The post of the joint secretary -- crucial to policy making and
implementation of government programmes -- is filled by career bureaucrats,
who usually join the service after passing exams conducted by the Union Public
Service Commission.

The idea of lateral entry into bureaucracy has been under discussion on and
off for years, but this is the first time it has been acted upon. The
government has said it is keen on it to bring in ""fresh ideas and new
approaches to governance"".

The notification from the Department of Personnel Training says it is looking
for 10 ""outstanding individuals"" who are willing to contribute towards nation
building. Those eligible includes ""Individuals working at comparable levels in
Private Sector Companies, Consultancy Organisations,
International/Multinational Organisations with a minimum of 15 years'
experience"".

The recruitment will be done on contract basis for three to five years. The
recruitments will be made in 10 departments -- including Revenue, Financial
Services, Economic Affairs, Commerce and Civil Aviation.

The posts are also open to officials of any state/UT Government who are
already working at equivalent level, and individuals working at comparable
levels in public sector undertakings, autonomous bodies, universities and
research institutes.

The civil services system was considered one of the best British legacies to
Independent India, given its lack of experience in governance and huge need
for socio-economic development. But post-liberalisation in 1990s, the
bureaucracy was seen by some sections as stagnant.

The need of the day, they asserted, was specialized knowledge and pointed to
the advent of domain experts like Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Nandan Nilekani,
Arvind Subramanian and Raghuram Rajan in government organisations and advisory
bodies.

The government's announcement received mixed response on social media. While
most hailed it as a welcome step that would bring in the much-needed field
experts in governance, critics said the system can only work if the method of
selection is impartial, objective and transparent.

__ Comments

""How can this Manuvadi government sideline the UPSC and appoint whoever they
like to important posts like joint secretaries without conducting exams? This
is a violation of the constitution and reservation. Tomorrow they will appoint
a PM and cabinet without conducting elections. They have made a joke out of
the constitutions,"" tweeted Bihar Tejashwi Yadav.

&gt; The much talked and debated reform is here now. Lateral entry to government
at Joint Secretary level. Hope this reform will usher an era of good policy
formulations and without getting into the trap of spoil system.

state-run banks, only two -- Indian Bank and Vijaya Bank -- posted profits
during the year under review. Chennai-headquartered Indian Bank posted the
highest profit of Rs 1,258.99 crore and Vijaya Bank's profit stood at Rs
727.02 crore. Rest of the 19 PSBs collectively posted a net loss of Rs 87,357
crore during the fiscal, according to the latest quarterly numbers posted by
these lenders.

All 21 banks had together posted a net profit of Rs 473.72 crore in the
2016-17 fiscal. Punjab National Bank, which is reeling under over Rs
14,000-crore scam allegedly perpetrated by Nirav Modi and associates, posted a

net loss

of Rs 12,282.82 crore last fiscal. In 2016-17, the Delhi-headquartered bank
had posted a profit of Rs 1,324.8 crore. PNB was followed by IDBI Bank, whose
net loss widened to Rs 8,237.93 crore in the fiscal ended March 2018 from Rs
5,158.14 crore in the previous year.

India's largest bank State Bank of India too added hugely to the combined
losses of PSBs. SBI's net loss in 2017-18 stood at Rs 6,547.45 crore as
against a net profit of Rs 10,484.1 crore in 2016-17.

Losses by state-run banks have almost entirely wiped out the

$13-billion capital

infusion by the government, and the situation is unlikely to improve in the
current fiscal year, said ratings agency Fitch.

Indian banking sector is grappling with mounting non-performing assets (NPAs)
and host of scams and frauds. The NPA in the banking sector stood at Rs 8.31
lakh crore as of December 2017. Weak financials due to mounting bad loans have
already pushed 11 banks, out of 21 state-owned banks, under the

Prompt Corrective Action

(PCA) framework of the Reserve Bank.

The recent tight prudential norms released by the RBI on February 12 have
added to the NPA woes. Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal has

announced setting

up of a committee to give recommendations in two weeks on formation of an
Asset Reconstruction Company for faster resolution of stressed accounts.

The committee under Sunil Mehta, non-executive chairman of PNB, will make
recommendations in two weeks on setting up of an Asset Reconstruction Company
or Asset Management Company for faster resolution of stressed accounts.

__ Comments

The finance minister said the committee will consider whether such an
arrangement will be good for the banking system and, if any such suggestion is
advisable, it will also consider the modalities by which such an ARC and/or
and AMC should be set up.

**Railways punctuality slips from 80% to 65%** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: The Indian Railways‚Äô punctuality score, or on-time performance of
trains that ferry millions of people every day on the world‚Äôs busiest public
transportation network, has fallen to 65% in the past three months, one of the
lowest figures reported by railways in recent times.

Until a few months ago, the Railways reported punctuality of 80% and above,
which railway ministry officials claimed has also been the average score for
the last one decade or so. During its research, ET couldn‚Äôt verify the lowest
ever on-time performance of the 165-year-old national transporter.

Currently, many long-route trains are running with delays of even up to 20
hours, causing huge inconvenience to passengers. Even the premier

Champaran Humsafar

train launched by Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

to celebrate 100 years of Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha in April 2018
is, on an average, running late by 12 hours.

Railway Board chairman Ashwani Lohani had recently claimed that the
punctuality scores dipped not only because of a high number of maintenance
blocks but also because of implementation of automatic reporting through data
loggers.

Earlier reporting was done manually but after the change, instances of
misreporting have fallen. Lohani had said that the railways now used data
loggers to report punctuality and 90% of punctuality figures were auto
generated through these loggers. Hence, they were completely genuine.

However, a May 31 letter written by the efficiency department of the Railway
Board to all general managers and seen by ET claims that these data loggers
are operational only at 55 locations. The Indian railroad network has more
than 8,000 stations across the country. A top official said that one the
reasons for the increasing number of train delays is also the ongoing tussle
between the two premier services of

Indian Railways

‚Äì the railway traffic and engineering services. The turf war has also led to
cancellations of trains, causing the railways a revenue loss on a daily basis.

The traffic service, responsible for the operation of trains, has blamed the
engineering service, which is in charge of track and other maintenance related
issues, of availing the blocks but not completing maintenance chores.

Block is the amount of time when there is no train movement in certain
stretches due to scheduled maintenance and safety related assignments.
Officials said that the issue has also been raised with top decision-makers at
the ministry.

‚ÄúRecently, a seven-hour block was taken in Delhi's Nizamuddin. However, no
work was done. This has become frequent now. Also, different departments such
as signalling and civil works take different maintenance blocks on the same
routes,‚Äù a top traffic service official said.

Officials have now proposed to annualised scheduled maintenance blocks so that
the calendar for maintenance can be planned in advance. ‚ÄúThis model has been
tried in the Howrah division by the former divisional manager and it turned
out to be successful. This can be replicated across the country,‚Äù the official
added.

Facing flak from passengers, Railways Minister

Piyush Goyal

had warned top officials, including the secretary rank zonal general managers
at the public transporter, to improve punctuality to be eligible for
promotions. Goyal, while addressing a recent railway conference, had said that
he wanted to improve train safety without compromising much on punctuality.

After the railway conference, Lohani wrote a social media post, blaming
historical maintenance backlogs for train delays. ‚ÄúSacrificing the long-term
future for apparent short-term gains results in the spoiled present as well as
the future‚Ä¶ It is indeed foolish to think that tangible results can be
produced out of thin air,‚Äù Lohani had said in the post.

Lohani did not respond to email queries sent by ET seeking the reason for
delays and whether any action was taken against officials responsible for not
wrapping up the work on time, despite taking maintenance blocks on the super
high-density routes.

Mohit Goel, founder of Ringing Bells that offered world's cheapest smartphone
'Freedom 251', and others arrested by police in Delhi.

Launched as the World‚Äôs cheapest smartphone ‚ÄòFreedom 251‚Äô maker Ringing Bells
founder Mohit Goel has been arrested by the police. Along with Mohit Goel,
many others have been reportedly arrested by the police reports news agency
ANI. The arrests were carried out in the city of Delhi. More details awaited
about the situation.

Earlier, Mohit Goel had spent more than three months in jail on allegations of
fraud. However, on May 31, Ringing Bells Managing Director got bail from the
Allahabad High Court. Ghaziabad-based Ayam Enterprises alleged that Goel
‚Äòdefrauded‚Äô the company of Rs 16 lakh. Goel was arrested in February in Uttar
Pradesh.

Ringing Bells launched Freedom 251 back in 2016. The smartphone was dubbed as
the world‚Äôs cheapest smartphone which would cost Rs 251. As per the company,
it made claims that it received as many as 7.5 crore orders for world‚Äôs
cheapest smartphone. However, the company later said that it delivered only
70,000 units of the smartphone. Since then there has been no word on when the
remaining orders will be shipped.

The company had asked for help from PM Narendra Modi for them to deliver the
remaining units of Freedom 251 in time. Under the Digital India initiative,
Mohit Goel asked for Rs 50,000 crore from the government in a letter addressed
to Prime Minister Modi. Ringing Bells even launched an array of other devices,
such as Freedom HD LED TV in early July.

**Nirav Modi In UK Now, Seeking Asylum Over ""Political Persecution"": Report** 

 ______ 
Nirav Modi is in London trying to claim asylum from what he calls ""political
persecution"", a report said

Nirav Modi, the billionaire jeweller at the heart of a more than $2 billion
fraud case, has fled to the UK, where he is claiming political asylum, the
Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing Indian and British officials.

Britain's Home Office said it does not provide information on individual
cases. Nirav Modi could not be contacted by Reuters for comment on the

FT report

.

Punjab National Bank said earlier in 2018 that two jewellery groups headed by

Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi had defrauded it of about $2.2 billion

by raising credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks using illegal
guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff at a Mumbai branch over several years.

Nirav Modi is in London trying to claim asylum from what he calls ""political
persecution"", the FT reported.

PNB's staff at a Mumbai branch helped Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi raise credit
from overseas branches by issuing illegal guarantees

Ministry of external affairs told the FT the Indian government was waiting for
the law enforcement agencies to approach them before pushing for an
extradition, which had thus far not happened. The ministry did not respond to
a Reuters request for comment outside regular working hours.

India is already seeking the extradition of Vijay Mallya

, a liquor and aviation tycoon, over unpaid loans to his defunct Kingfisher
Airlines after the businessman and co-owner of the Formula One Force India
team moved to Britain in March last year.

The

Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed charges

against more than 25 people in May including Mr Modi, Mr Choksi, former PNB
chief Usha Ananthasubramanian, two of the bank's executive directors and three
companies belonging to Nirav Modi.

__ Comments

Mr Modi and Mr Choksi have denied any wrongdoing.

Last month, senior executives at the bank were accused by the CBI, in a charge
sheet filed in court, of misleading the state-run bank in late 2016 over the
lender's handling of the financial messaging system and credit guarantees that
were at the centre of the fraud.

**Brother Of Doctor Jailed Over Children's Deaths In UP's Gorakhpur Shot At** 

 ______ 
**Gorakhpur: **

The brother of Dr Kafeel Khan, who is out on bail in connection with the
Gorakhpur baby death case, was shot at last night in Gorakhpur. Around 11 pm
on Sunday, men on a motorcycle allegedly fired at Kashif Jameel, who is a
businessman, and fled.

The 34-year-old brother of Dr Khan was immediately taken to a private nursing
home. Dr Khan told the media a bullet was lodged in his brother's neck and he
had to arrange for an emergency surgery to get it removed.

After the bullet was taken out, Kashif was shifted to the government-run BRD
medical college and hospital, where he is under observation for another 48
hours, doctors said.

No motive was found behind the shooting of Dr Khan's brother said police
sources.

Hours after the shooting, Gujarat lawmaker Jignesh Mevani targeted the BJP-led
government for the attack on Kashif. Mr Mevani tweeted ""Dr Kafeel saved
children when Yogi Adityanath government had no money to pay for oxygen. He
was put behind bars. Now his brother is shot at. Thank you so much Modi

_ji_

for what your

_ 'acche din'_

are offering us - hate speeches, violence, bloodshed and bullets.""

On April 25, Dr Khan got bail from the Allahabad High Court. The bail was
given after he spent eight months in jail. The court said there was no direct
evidence of negligence on his part.

__ Comments

Dr Khan's family insists he was made a scapegoat in the case as he was in-
charge of the paediatrics ward, when the tragedy happened.

More than 60 children, mostly infants, had died at BRD hospital in Gorakhpur
within a week in August, 2017. There were allegations that the deaths occurred
due to disruption in oxygen supply. The BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government,
however, had denied that shortage of oxygen led to the deaths.

**At Rs 18.5 lakh crore, cash with public at record high** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Currency with the public has reached a record high of over Rs 18.5
lakh crore, more than double the low of Rs 7.8 lakh crore it had hit after

demonetisation

in late 2016, as per

RBI

data.

The

total currency put in circulation

by the Reserve Bank has also more than doubled to over Rs 19.3 lakh crore ‚Äî
from a low of about Rs 8.9 lakh crore post-demonetisation.

As a percentage of

GDP

, however, the proportion remains much lower than the pre-demonetisation
level. Currency with the public is arrived at after deducting cash with banks
from total currency in circulation.

This high level of currency available with the public is in contrast to the
reported cash crunch in various parts of the country a few months ago.
Hoarding of cash was then cited as a possible factor that could have triggered
an artificial currency crunch.

The figures for both ‚Äòcurrency with the public‚Äô and ‚Äòcurrency in circulation‚Äô
have also exceeded the levels seen before the government‚Äôs demonetisation
decision on November 8, 2016, that saw nearly 86% of the currency in
circulation at that time being invalidated overnight by scrapping the then Rs
500/1,000 banknotes.

The public was given time to deposit the invalidated notes in banks, which saw
nearly 99% of banned notes coming back into the system.

As per the RBI‚Äôs latest disclosure in this regard, people had returned Rs
15.28 lakh crore as on June 30, 2017, of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore banned
currency, or 98.96%, of the scrapped notes to the banking system.

Since then, the RBI has introduced new denominations of Rs 2,000 and Rs 200,
among others, besides a new Rs 500 note. After the recent cash crunch, the
government had announced that printing of Rs 500 notes would be stepped up.

While the RBI is yet to announce its final word on processing and verification
of all the returned notes, the latest ‚Äòmoney supply‚Äô data from the central
bank puts the ‚Äúcurrency with the public‚Äù at over Rs 18.5 lakh crore as on May
25, 2018 ‚Äî up more than 31% from year-ago level.

This is an over two-fold jump from Rs 7.8 lakh crore as on December 9, 2016 ‚Äî
the lowest level it had seen after the announcement of the demonetisation
decision as people rushed to deposit the scrapped notes with banks and the
RBI. Prior to demonetisation, the currency with the public stood at about Rs
17 lakh crore.

In terms of ‚Äòcurrency in circulation‚Äô, the RBI puts the latest figure at over
Rs 19.3 lakh crore as on June 1, 2018 ‚Äî again a jump of about 30% from the
year-ago level, according to the ‚Äòreserve money‚Äô data released by the central
bank.

This also marks an over two-fold rise from a low of Rs 8.9 lakh crore as on
January 6, 2017 ‚Äî the lowest level it saw post-demonetisation. The current
level of currency in circulation is also above the pre-demonetisation figure
of Rs 17.9 lakh crore as on November 5, 2016.

The RBI publishes the figures for currency in circulation on a weekly basis,
while the currency with the public comes out every fortnight.

An analysis of historic data shows that the currency with the public stood at
about Rs 13 lakh crore before the Modi government took charge in May 2014.

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries. A
memorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India‚Äôs first
Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR‚Äôs Central
Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI
Solar Power Pvt Ltd.

According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology
of Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr
Gopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)
New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)
Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.

‚ÄúCSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype
Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost
reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology
for mass production,‚Äù a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.

At present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for
import of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150
million in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.

Speaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister
Harsh Vardhan said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs development is a validation of the capabilities
of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support
our industry, besides other sectors.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi ‚Äì increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by
generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and
the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to
electric vehicles by 2030,‚Äù said Harsh Vardhan.

The project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi‚Äôs vision of ‚ÄúMake

**Political debate to focus on Modi versus 'anarchist combination': Arun Jaitley** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Union minister Arun

Jaitley

on Saturday said aspirational India will reject the ""anarchist"" formation of
""disparate political parties"" which are promising to come together to fight
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the next general elections.

He said the political agenda for the debate this year appropriately will be
Prime Minister Narendra

Modi

versus an ""anarchist combination"" of such parties.

""A group of disparate political parties are promising to come together. Some
of their leaders are temperamental, the others occasionally change ideological
positions. With many of them, such as TMC, DMK, TDP, BSP and the JD(S), the
BJP has had an opportunity to share power. They frequently change political
positions,"" Jaitley wrote in a

Facebook

post.

**Mega Times Group poll: 71.9% of Indians say they will vote for Narendra Modi as PM again in 2019**

Aspirational societies with vibrant democracies do not invite anarchy, the
minister said, adding that a strong nation and the requirements of good
governance abhor anarchy.

Several opposition parties including the

Congress

are trying to forge an alliance to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha
elections.

Prime Minister Modi has given 'scam-free' government and his fifth year will
focus on consolidation of policies and programmes, he wrote.

Jaitley, who had a renal transplant earlier this month and has yesterday been
shifted out of ICU, said the country's mood has transformed from despair to
hope and aspirations in last four years.

""Good governance and good economics have been blended with good politics. The
result of this has been that the BJP is more confident, its geographical base
has become much bigger, its social base has expanded and its winnability has
hugely increased,"" he said.

Attacking Congress, Jaitley said the party ""is in desperation without the
perks of office"".

""From the dominant party of Indian politics, it is moving towards the
'fringe', its political positions are not of a mainstream party but one
usually adopted by 'fringe' organisations. Fringe organisations can never hope
to come in power,"" the minister's Facebook post noted.

""Its best hope lies in becoming a supporter of regional political parties.
State level regional political parties have realised that the marginalised
Congress can at best be either a junior partner or a marginal supporter,"" he
said.

**India saved Rs-5,000 crore forex post new steel policy: Steel Secretary** 

 ______ 
The rollout of new steel policy saved forex of Rs 5,000 crore since last year
while around 24 million tonnes of

crude steel capacity

was added during past four years, Steel Secretary

Aruna Sharma

said.

India also replaced Japan as the second largest steel producer this year, she
said.

""We are not going to stop here. We all know about the ambitious

National Steel Policy

(NSP) announced last year under which we have set a target of raising the
capacity to 300 MT by 2030 and produce 250 MT of crude steel.

""Plans for further expansion are already on anvil. Immediately after the roll
out of the policy in May 2017, an estimated savings of around Rs 5,000 crore
worth of foreign exchange has been achieved as of now,"" the top official told
in an interview on achievements and initiatives taken by

Ministry of Steel

in past four years.

Steel production capacity has increased from 110 MT in 2014-15 to 134 MT in
2017-18, while 7 MT was added in 2017 alone, she outlined.

Indian steel sector has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR)
of about 5 per cent over the past four years on account of improvement in the
overall capacity utilisation, she said.

""At the current pace and outlook of the industry, steel making capacity is
expected to reach 150 MT mark by 2020.""

Steel exports have been surging since FY2014-15, she said.

""InFY17, India became net exporter of steel with significant export of 8.2 MT
registering 102 per cent growth over previous fiscal. The exports from 5.6 MT
in FY15 rose to 9.6 MT in FY18. On the other hand, the imports have declined
by 36 per cent from a level of 11.7 MT in FY16 to 7.5 MT in FY18,"" she added.

A number of PSUs including Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) turned
profitable, she said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a steel
processing unit of SAIL in Kandrori near Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh in October
last year where high-end special steel TMT bars will be produced.

To a question related to supply of raw materials like coking coal, iron ore
etc, the secretary said there will not be any scarcity of raw material for the
producers.

The new steel policy, she said, envisages to meet the entire demand of high-
end grade automotive steel, electrical steel, special steels and alloys for
strategic applications and increase domestic availability of washed coking
coal so as to reduce import dependence on coking coal from about 85 per cent
to 65 per cent by 65 per cent.

When asked about employment potential of the initiatives taken by the
ministry, the secretary observed that the policy aims at generating additional
employment for 36 lakh people directly or indirectly.

Besides raising capacity, the government also worked towards increasing the
domestic steel consumption.

""Owing to the enabling steps taken by the government, we brought it from 59 kg
in 2014 to 69 kg (provisional figure) on date. Before that it had taken seven
years to raise the per capita consumption from 50 kg to 59 kg,"" she said.

The national steel policy also aims to increase the per capita steel
consumption to 160 kg by 2030.

Sharing here experience about the sector, Sharma said the industry was facing
a tough time. It was not growing at the pace it should have been. As the new
government was working towards the progress of the sector, the issue of NPAs
(non performing asset) came up, she said adding ""NPAs in the steel sector
reached to their peak of Rs 1.15 lakh crore which was about 30 per cent of the
total industry NPAs in March 2016.""

However, it was good also that the problem was identified and so steps were
taken to resolve it. Once the cases get resolved, the plants will give their
full contribution, she said and added ""As the steel sector has been performing
well for the last two years, bidding for the stressed under NCLT process is
heading towards positive resolution.""

Besides, dumping of cheap steel items was another issue, she said. Sharma said
the ministry imposed trade remedial measures and brought in quality control
order.

""Imposition of minimum import price, anti dumping duties, safeguard duty and
countervailing duty resulted in curbing unabated exports and unfair trade
practices like

predatory pricing

by other countries.

""To decrease import and making of substandard steel items in India and to
provide a level playing to small players vis-a-vis bigger players, more than
80 per cent steel products have been brought under quality control orders by
notifying 37 steel and steel products under BIS Act,"" she said.

Basically, there's a very long history of NGOs being used as a tool by foreign govts and corporations.

**""Coca-Cola Maker Sold Shikanji"": Why #AccordingToRahulGandhi Trended** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

Rahul Gandhi today served his critics something to snigger about as he told a
large gathering in Delhi that the founder of Coca-Cola started by selling ""

_shikanji_

"" or lemonade and McDonalds was born from a

_dhaba_

.

""Who started Coca-Cola company? Do you know? I will tell you who,"" the
Congress president said as he addressed his party's convention for backward
castes at an indoor stadium.

""Coca-Cola

_wala _

America

_mein shikanji bechta tha _

(The man who started Coca Cola sold

_shikanji _

in the US). He sold sugar mixed in water. His skill was recognised and
rewarded,"" he said.

Warming up to his theme, he also said, ""You know McDonald's. It is everywhere.
Who started it? He ran a

_dhaba _

(food joint) but we all have seen the brand's progress. You show me one person
who runs a

_dhaba _

and has sent up a Coca-Cola in India. Ford was a mechanic, so was Honda.""

Where, he questioned, are these people in India?

""It's not that we don't have talent, knowledge, power, ability...but we don't
have banks willing to help, offer loans. The government isn't supportive.""

Coca-Cola was founded by American pharmacist John Pemberton in 1886 when he
prepared a soda-fountain beverage which later became the world famous cola
drink.

McDonald's was set up in 1940 by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The couple
first opened a hot dog stand in 1937 in California before growing into a chain
that is present in 100 countries.

Rahul Gandhi used the anecdotes to target the ruling BJP and Prime Minister
Narendra Modi, accusing them of benefiting a handful of industrialists. ""The
BJP's strategy is clear. 15-20 rich capitalists will give thousands of crores
to PM Modi and all benefits will go to just those 15-20 rich people.""

As expected, the Coca-Cola-

_shikanji _

story was too delicious for Twitter to pass up. Soon, the hashtag
#AccordingToRahulGandhi was trending and the Congress chief was being trolled.

One Twitter user sad the Congress IT cell had edited the Coca-Cola founder's
Wikipedia page to ""prove"" the party chief correct.

Rahul Gandhi faced similar derision over a comment he made in 2013 to a
gathering of Dalits.

__ Comments

He was explaining that Dalits have to fight harder to get ahead, when he used
the analogy of Jupiter.

""There is a concept called escape velocity in aeronautics. From Earth, your
velocity has to be 11 km a second...If you are on Jupiter, you need to go at
60 km per hour....In India, Dalits need Jupiter's escape velocity on Earth,""
he said, perhaps losing many in his audience during the explanation.

98,"&gt; So you are normalizing killings. And when the other side does it, they are fascists . 

No. He(she?) is pointing out that politically motivated violence between the militant wings of two political parties/organisations is not the same as violence on civilians. It is easy to lose nuance when you just say both these things are the same because they are murders. It's similar to saying that both Modi and RaGa are bad, therefore they are the same.

&gt; Never knew this. would be great if you can provide the official stats, for the most of them.

It's tiring to keep doing this. Last time I checked, the RSS had lost 42, the Left lost 43 in Kerala. It tends to be politically motivated violence between (mostly) the goons of each party. 

This is common knowledge in Kerala. But in the rest of India, it is framed as some sort of targeted killing of Hindus in Kerala, by the BJP. Obviously it's done for political gain.

101,"&gt;Where are the moderate BJP supporters

I could be wrong, but at the risk of sounding naive, it might be supposed that after Demonetization, there has been a re thinking in BJP. I cannot think of any business house, or large businesses that directly benefited from that move. It put the executive in a rather dominant position. If today, a Nirav Modi/Jay Shah/Bengal BJP/Rafale  scandals are gaining traction, its because people have seen how govt can be decisive, if it wants. People are bound to ask, why do you not act in these cases too. 

So, that whole exercise hasn't really benefited the BJP favoring businesses who would have preferred relative anonymity. 

Now, I would think that any reasonable BJP supporter the *so called* moderate BJP. Would have seen this, and started looking for alternatives, re thinking their choice.

But, there is nowhere, where they will be welcomed with garlands and applause. Knowing the level of ego an average BJPite would have, its feasible to think, that these people are now, receding into their own cloistered groups. Choosing to delude themselves with hypothetical situations and conspiracy theories.

I think they know that they are quite unwanted in BJP, if there is anything demonetization has made crystal clear, is that the guy at the top doesn't listen. Even the best reasonable people aren't going to convince them.

So, i guess its like a political limbo, where they have to either sacrifice their dignity and become crass goons/justify crass goonery or choose to remain silent, till someone who agrees with them, gives them an ear.",2018-06-11 20:58:29

**""Won't Bend"": Kafeel Khan, Blamed For Baby Deaths, On Attack On Brother** 

 ______ 
**Gorakhpur: **

The brother of Kafeel Khan, the doctor who was jailed last year in connection
with child deaths in Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's home base
Gorakhpur, was shot at last night in the town.

Around 11 pm on Sunday, men on a motorcycle allegedly fired at Kashif Jameel,
a businessman, and fled.

The doctor took to Twitter this morning and said, ""

_Allah rahem kare_

. M not going to bend."" He told reporters that the bullets have been removed
from his brother's body, and ""the operation has been successful. He is
currently in ICU. Three bullets were shot at him in order to kill him. Who has
fired, we do not know. But it was 500 metres from Gorakhnath Temple, where the
UP Chief Minister was staying.""

The 34-year-old was taken to a private nursing home after he was fired at. Dr
Khan told the media that one of the bullets was lodged in his brother's neck
and he had to arrange for an emergency surgery to get it removed.

His brother was reportedly shuttled from a private hospital to two government-
run facilities, and back to a private hospital. The surgery reportedly took
place around 2 am, three hours after the firing.

""Yesterday night I was insisting on a private hospital because I know a
prominent neuro surgeon there. But the police kept saying that I must go to
the Sadar hospital first and then to the BRD hospital. But it is the doctors
at the BRD hospital who sent him back to this private hospital. So crucial
time was wasted yesterday night,"" Dr Khan said.

Dr Kafeel Khan said his brother was shot 500 metres away from Gorakhnath
temple

No motive was found behind the shooting of Dr Khan's brother said police
sources.

Kashif is now under observation for another 48 hours at the private nursing
home, the doctors said.

Hours after the shooting, Gujarat lawmaker Jignesh Mevani targeted the state's
BJP government. Mr Mevani tweeted ""Dr Kafeel saved children when Yogi
Adityanath government had no money to pay for oxygen. He was put behind bars.
Now his brother is shot at. Thank you so much Modi ji for what your 'acche
din' are offering us - hate speeches, violence, bloodshed and bullets.""

On April 25, Dr Khan was released on bail from the Allahabad High Court after
eight months in jail. The court said there was no direct evidence of
negligence on his part.

__ Comments

More than 60 children, mostly infants, had died at BRD hospital in Gorakhpur
within a week in August, 2017. There were allegations that the deaths occurred
due to disruption in oxygen supply. The BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government,
however, had denied that shortage of oxygen led to the deaths.

Dr Khan was in charge of the pediatrics wing and had arranged oxygen cylinders
from a private hospital. But he was removed and arrested on charges of
negligence. His family insists he was made a scapegoat.

As for moderate BJP supporters, I'd say that some of them would be anyone who isn't a rabbit Muslim hater, anyone who thought the Gujarat model would spread and the benefits would trickle down, anyone who isn't aware of the ghettoizing if Muslims (especially in Gujarat and elsewhere as well), anyone who genuinely believed that the BJP would have a better sense for the economy than a regime which was headed by MMS, anyone who didn't read the news pre 2014 where RaGa was pretty much treated with respect (the BJP hitjob on his image hasn't succeeded yet), people who thought the BJP would fixed corruption, etc etc. A lot of these would be middle class folks, those whom I direct most of my ire at. 

As for ego, there's plenty of it in all sides. But what is interesting is how all these educated people have bought into the conspiracy that the""left/liberals"" hate the country and are lying, while the govt misrepresents numbers all the time. This means that the moderate BJP folks don't seem to be bothered at all by the state of the... well, state and the echo chambers validate their choices.

Also worrying, is this tendency to portray Modi as this patriarch who's doing his best for the country. But as anyone who's had a traditional Indian father would tell you, the trouble with these dads is that their authority cannot (and should not) be questioned and you cannot replace them. Those aren't good qualities for a prime minister. He's our representative, not our ruler.

Like a bad manager, he takes all the credit and all failures are blamed on the others or they're spun at a Shane Warne-esque level. His Star campaigner is this fundamentalist nutjob who's trampling over the rule of law in his State and no one has a problem with that. Every misstep is described as something Congress has done in the past and I don't understand when these moderates will get tired of it.

My personal feeling is that in the end something really banal would spell disaster for the current regime, because there's no one in their movement who's holding them to account for anything. They're too powerful for the opposition, so it'll have to be sheer luck that brings them down.

**Grant statehood to Delhi, will campaign for you in 2019 elections, Arvind Kejriwal tells BJP**

Kejriwal has equated the fight for Delhi‚Äôs full statehood with the freedom
struggle. (File)

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said if the national capital
was granted full statehood before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, AAP would
campaign in favour of BJP, but anything less than that would result in a ‚ÄúBJP
leave Delhi‚Äù movement. Kejriwal‚Äôs remarks came on the last day of the special
session of the Delhi Assembly, which accepted the resolution on full statehood
to the national √ßapital.

Kejriwal, who has turned the fight for Delhi‚Äôs full statehood into a plank for
the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, further said if the Narendra Modi-led government
acceded to its demand, it would ensure that ‚Äúeach and every vote from Delhi
goes in your favour‚Äù.

However, he warned that if the AAP demand was not granted, people of Delhi
would throw out the BJP from the state. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt do so, Delhi residents
will put up boards saying ‚ÄòBJP leave Delhi‚Äô,‚Äù ANI quoted Kejriwal as saying.

The last day of the special session of the Delhi Assembly witnessed high drama
as the opposition members first staged a walkout, then returned to the House
and were marshalled out later. It started with Leader of Opposition Vijender
Gupta and BLP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa raising slogans against the Delhi
government for its failure to ensure water supply to the city.

In a similar clarion call on Sunday, Kejriwal, addressing party‚Äôs ward-level
office-bearers and legislators at his residence, equated the fight for Delhi‚Äôs
full statehood with the freedom struggle. In a passionate address, he said
Mahatma Gandhi had launched Quit India campaign during the British rule, and
AAP will run ‚ÄòL-G, Delhi Chodo‚Äô campaign.

Following the meeting, AAP leader Gopal Rai announced that the party would
hold 300 meetings from June 17-24 on statehood. Rai added that even after 70
years of independence, people of Delhi were still not free: ‚ÄúNo other state
government has got a majority (like AAP in Delhi). Still, people have to go to
the L-G for the smallest of tasks.‚Äù

**Atal Bihari Vajpayee rushed to AIIMS, condition said to be ‚Äòcritical‚Äô** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister

Atal Bihari Vajpayee

, who has been ailing for long, was admitted to AIIMS on Monday, sparking
concern which saw PM

Narendra Modi

along with several others rushing to the institute. Vajpayee, who has been
bed-ridden since 2009, has been suffering from lower respiratory tract
infection and kidney- related issues.

In a late night statement, AIIMS said the former PM has been ‚Äúdiagnosed with a
urinary tract infection‚Äù for which appropriate treatment is being given and a
team of doctors are closely monitoring him. Sources in AIIMS described the
condition of BJP stalwart as ‚Äúcritical‚Äù, with his sole kidney and lung
performing at their lowest capacity.

However, Aarti Vij, chairperson of AIIMS‚Äô media and protocol division, said,
‚ÄúThe former Prime Minister has been admitted for examination and management.

He is stable.‚Äù There was a risk of health emergency developing, sources said.

The 93-year-old will be under supervision of AIIMS director Randeep Guleria
who has been treating him for nearly 15 years. Vajpayee, who is diabetic and
has only one functional kidney, suffered a stroke in 2009 which affected his
cognitive abilities. Later, he developed dementia.

Sources said he recently developed fever and he aspirated something, but the
immediate trigger for his hospitalisation on Monday could not be ascertained.

The three-time former PM, the last between 1999 and 2004, had been restricted
mostly to his residence on Krishna Menon Marg where a team of doctors, nurses
and physiotherapists look after him 24x7.

He was admitted to the hospital at around 11.30 am. While it was initially
said he had been taken for a routine check-up, concern about his condition
soared by the evening with BJP chief Amit Shah as well as Congress president

Rahul Gandhi

visiting him at AIIMS.

PM Modi also reached the hospital and spent about 50 minutes in the cardio-
neuro centre talking to doctors and Vajpayee‚Äôs family. BJP veteran L K Advani
and Union health minister J P Nadda were among those who visited the hospital.

**Prohibition law to stay in Bihar, will be amended to prevent misuse: Nitish Kumar** 

 ______ 
By:

Express Web Desk

| Patna |

Published: June 11, 2018 6:38:33 pm

The Bihar CM was talking to the press on sidelines of Lok Samvad- a public
interaction initiative along with Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and
others. (File Photo)

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday announced that the liquor ban
prevalent in the state would continue to remain in force and that his
government would amend the excise law taking the complaints of its misuse into
consideration.

Further, the chief minister said that the liquor prohibition in the state was
part of a larger social reform and would include prohibiting the consumption
of all forms of intoxicants. The prohibition also aims to ban the consumption
of Khaini, an unprocessed raw form of tobacco, widely popular among a section
in Bihar.

Kumar, however, assured that necessary care would be taken to safeguard the
interest of those whose livelihood would get affected because of the ban.

‚ÄúIf you ask me whether we wish to amend the prohibition law, my answer is yes.
However, I cannot speak about the details which are being worked out by our
legal experts. When we came up with our excise law on October 02, 2016, it was
said that some of the provisions were too harsh. Thereafter we have been
hearing complaints of its misuse,‚Äù he told reporters.

‚ÄúIt is because of our intention to bring in suitable amendments that we
submitted an application before the Supreme Court as the matter is sub-judice.
We have been told that we can bring amendments to minimize misuse of the law.
That we will do. But prohibition must remain in force. People do not realize
the impact it has had on the lives of the people, especially the poor,‚Äù the
chief minister said as reported by PTI.

In reply to a question about his government requesting the Central Government
to include Khaini among the FSSAI‚Äôs list of food product, in order to ban it
in the state, the CM said ‚Äúwe want to make our society Nasha-Mukt (free from
consumption of any kind of intoxicants.)‚Äù

‚ÄúWe realize that a large number of people in the state depend upon cultivation
of tobacco for their livelihood. We are undertaking a drive to divert them
towards alternative crops. We would not allow them to suffer on account of a
measure that aims at reforming the society,‚Äù he added.

He gave example of communities which were involved in manufacture of toddy and
country-made liquor. ‚ÄúWe have introduced schemes to provide them with
alternative sources of livelihood,‚Äù said Kumar.

Opposition leaders, including the former Chief Minister and Hindustani Awam
Morcha President Jitan Ram Manjhi, have been critical of the Nitish Kumar
administration over the ban, alleging that people punished for violating the
law are primarily Dalits from a poor background and that the government fails
to catch the big fish.

**Let's give peace and talks a chance in Kashmir: General Bipin Rawat** 

 ______ 
Peace should be given a chance in Kashmir, said Army chief General Bipin Rawat
in an exclusive conversation with ET, adding that he was in favour of dialogue
to break the cycle of terror groups recruiting more Kashmiri youth.

‚ÄúTalks must happen. The issue is that a lot of locals are joining militancy.
We kill them and more would join. Infiltration can be controlled, but this
cycle of recruitment of local youth can go on and on. So‚Ä¶let‚Äôs give peace a
chance and see,‚Äù he told ET.

Further, on

Dokalam

and the overall situation on the

Line of Actual Control

with China, the Army chief said the situation had returned to ‚Äúnormal as
earlier‚Äù after the informal summit between Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

‚ÄúThings at the LAC are normal as earlier. We are encouraged by the meetings at
the highest level.‚Äù

On the status of the DGMO-level (Director General of Military Operations)
hotline between the two countries, he said: ‚ÄúWe have locallevel contact. For
this one, we have an interpreter problem and are thinking of how to go ahead
with it. If we call and if they don‚Äôt have an interpreter ready, then what.‚Äù

General Rawat refrained from revealing much on the inquiry into a Srinagar
hotel incident involving Major Leetul Gogoi, who hit headlines when he tied a
local to his jeep as a ‚Äúhuman shield‚Äù to rescue an election commission team
from stone pelters.

‚ÄúThe inquiry is on. I had also made the statement that strongest punishment
would be given to him if he is found guilty.‚Äù

Further, the Army chief elaborated on the question of soldiers having to buy
their own uniforms. ‚ÄúThe media must do some more research on this subject.
It‚Äôs actually better that soldiers buy uniforms on their own rather than from
the ordnance factories. The ordnance factory vests are so thick that no one
can wear them. So we let the jawan buy on his own, by his choice and when he
wants. We are giving the access to quality clothing,‚Äù he told ET.

The

Seventh Pay Commission

has authorised monetary compensation for selected items of personal clothing.
The finance ministry issued an order based on this on August 2 through which
soldiers were given Rs 10,000 as dress allowance.

On whether the Army has stipulated the range of items to be bought under the
dress allowance, Gen Rawat said: ‚ÄúWe have told the MoD (Ministry of Defence)
that within the Rs 10,000 allowance the soldier can buy 27 items. These 27
items would be rank badges, vests, different badges, etc, and only the daily
OG (known as Olive Green) uniform and not combat uniforms.‚Äù

This, he said, would work out as a much improved system from the point of the
view of the Army. ‚ÄúIt is better this way rather than giving let‚Äôs say Rs 950
to the ordnance factories for stitching my uniform. In the market, however, I
will only have to pay let‚Äôs say about Rs 400 to stitch a uniform, so why
should I get it made from the ordnance factories when I can get it made from
outside.‚Äù

The Army chief also responded to the controversy over the opening of
cantonment roads, saying it had to be done to help civilian population
residing in and accessing cantonment areas.

‚ÄúIf we find that a road is coming to a particular civilian area, should we
close it and think we are above everyone else. What we did earlier was from
about 5 pm to 7 pm we would close a particular road for walking. Now a
civilian who wants to pass through that area he is not allowed‚Ä¶ he gets
irritated.‚Äù

To elaborate, he gave the case of Pune Cantt, where the shortest route to a
communal graveyard (kabristan) heads through the cantonment. ‚ÄúWe had closed
this road. So civilians had to take a long detour to reach the kabristan. Now
a person is waiting at the road to reach the kabristan, he sees someone
bringing groceries for an officer and being allowed to move on the road, but
he cannot go. You are irritating people by closing roads. If you have to
manage security then manage it. Right now you have a false sense of security,
when you feel that you are secured in a closed environment‚Ä¶ we can‚Äôt put
civilians away. People will start becoming hostile, because they will think
that the Army feels its above everyone else,‚Äù he told ET.

**""Industrialists Got Crores, Farmers Got Nothing"": Rahul Gandhi Attacks PM** 

 ______ 
Rahul Gandhi was addressing the OBC Sammelan today.

**New Delhi: **

Congress president Rahul Gandhi today attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
claiming that his government has ignored the interests of farmers but has
helped a small group of industrialists by waiving loans amounting to nearly Rs
2.5 lakh crore.

Addressing workers of the party's OBC department

in Delhi

, he said people who work hard behind the scene are ""never benefitted"" and the
fruits of their toil are enjoyed by others.

""People with skills are not rewarded in India ... farmers work hard but you
don't see them in the office of Modi

_ji_

,"" he said.

Mr Gandhi claimed the non-performing assets of banks have gone up to Rs 1,000
crore.

__ Comments

""Rs 2.5 lakh crore were given to 15 industrialists. But the farmer got
nothing...the loan waiver was for 15 people but not for the farmer who
continues to commit suicide... his children keep crying,"" Mr Gandhi said.

He also challenged the stand of the government that India lacks skills saying
it was not true and the authorities have failed to recognise the fact.

**Fact check: Was Coca-Cola founder really a ‚Äòshikanji‚Äô seller? Here‚Äôs the¬†truth** 

 ______ 
The person who started Coca-Cola was a ‚Äòshikanji‚Äô (lemonade) seller,‚Äù said
Rahul Gandhi at a public gathering.

‚ÄúWho started Coca-Cola? Who was he, does anyone know? I will tell you who he
was. The person who started Coca-Cola was a ‚Äòshikanji‚Äô (lemonade) seller,‚Äù
said Rahul Gandhi at a public gathering. The Congress President said a similar
thing about McDonald‚Äôs, that its founder was running a dhaba (roadside
restaurant). However, the reality is the person who started Coca-Cola was not
a ‚Äòshikanji‚Äô seller but a pharmacist.

In 1886, in New York Harbour, John Pemberton, a pharmacist from Atlanta
stirred up a fragrant and caramel-coloured liquid, which he then combined with
carbonated water just out of curiosity. It was given to customers who liked it
so much that they were ready to pay 5 cents for a glass then. Pemberton‚Äôs
bookkeeper, Frank Robinson, named the mixture Coca-Cola, according to
company‚Äôs official website.

Although, it was not easy for John Pemberton in the beginning. In the first
year, Pemberton sold just nine glasses of Coca-Cola a day. Between 1888 and
1891, Atlanta businessman Asa Griggs Candler secured rights to the business
for a total of about $2,300 (about ¬£1,500). Asa Griggs Candler became Coca-
Cola‚Äôs first president and the first to bring real vision to the business and
the brand. Again, he was not a ‚Äòshikanji‚Äô seller. He was a drugstore clerk and
manufacturer of patent medicines.

But Rahul Gandhi is close when he says that McDonald‚Äôs founder ran a ‚Äòdhaba‚Äô.
The McDonald brothers ‚Äî Richard and Maurice McDonald ‚Äî opened a hot dog stand
in Monrovia, California in 1937, inspired by a local hot dog stand that sold
hot dogs ‚Äî which was then a profitable business.

Rahul Gandhi was addressing an OBC national convention of the party at
Talkatora Stadium in Delhi. Targetting the Narendra Modi government over a
host of issues, Rahul said that there is no dearth of skilled people in the
country but the issue is with the government that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt provide the
opportunity to our talented people‚Äù. The Congress president said that the
employment opportunities in the country have declined and accused the
government of extending favour to a particular section of people.

**Arvind Kejriwal Sued By AAP Rebel Kapil Mishra Over ""Low Attendance""** 

 ______ 
Kapil Mishra said Arvind Kejriwal's absence showed how serious he is for
people's welfare. (File)

**New Delhi: **

Aam Aadmi Party rebel lawmaker Kapil Mishra has moved a plea in the Delhi High
Court against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, seeking orders that the AAP
chief attend assembly sessions more frequently. Targetting him for ""low
attendance"", the former Delhi minister also sought that Mr Kejriwal be
directed to frame rules in assembly, making 75 per cent attendance mandatory
for all legislators. Responding to Mr Mishra's allegations, AAP leader Sanjay
Singh wrote on Twitter that he will move a similar plea against Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.

Mr Mishra, in his plea, urged the court to ""direct the Lt. Governor to
ascertain feasibility of 'No Work, No Pay' for the MLAs, if presence is less
than 50 per cent in the assembly.""

He requested the court to issue directions to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal
and the Speaker of the assembly to

ensure the presence of Mr Kejriwal in the house.

He also added that

Mr Kejriwal

should respond to questions related to public welfare.

""He (Mr Kejriwal) needs to inform the people of his constituency and also all
the citizens of Delhi how well he performed against indicators like attendance
in the assembly, the number of questions he replied, his understanding and
appreciation of the different policies and laws that he made, the time that he
spent in consulting their constituents, how well he oversaw the executive and
a statement disclosing his income and assets,"" the plea said.

""Last year, the Delhi Assembly had 27 sessions but the Chief Minister, who is
also the Water Minister, was present in seven only. It is not out of context
to state that Delhi faces water crisis every year,"" the plea said, adding that
during question hour, Mr Kejriwal was never present in the assembly in the
last 40 months.

He said in the plea Mr Kejriwal's absence showed ""how serious the Chief
Minister is in discussing matters related to the people"".

AAP parliamentarian Sanjay Singh responded to Mr Mishra's allegations in the
plea, saying why he had kept mum on alleged obstructions by PM Modi and
Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in the implementation of various projects of
the Delhi government.

""I am filing a case in the high court for getting Narendra Modi's attendance
and ensure his presence in Parliament. Why does Kapil Mishra keep mum on Modi
who obstructs every work by Delhi government?"" Mr Singh tweeted in Hindi.

__ Comments

In another tweet, he said despite appeal by the entire opposition, PM Modi
doesn't come to parliament.

**Land acquisition deadline for bullet train project set to be missed: Sources** 

 ______ 
PALGHAR/TOKYO: India is set to miss a December deadline to acquire land for
the Japan-backed $17 billion

bullet train

project following protests by fruit growers, government officials said, likely
delaying one of PM Modi‚Äôs most ambitious projects.

The PMO is now monitoring the project week-to-week, as officials seek to
reassure Tokyo that the hurdles can be overcome through intense negotiations
with sapota (fruit popularly known as

__

chiku

) and mango growers in Maharashtra.

Protests, backed by local politicians, have flared up in recent months against
attempts to secure sections of a 108-km stretch, which is around one-fifth of
the entire bullet train corridor connecting Mumbai with Ahmedabad, the largest
commercial city in Modi‚Äôs home state

Gujarat

.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked hard for three decades to develop this plantation, and they are
asking me to hand over this land,‚Äù sapota farmer Dashrat Purav, 62, said as he
showed his orchard in the town of

Palghar

, a three-hour-drive north of Mumbai.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt worked hard to surrender land for the project. I did that for my
children.‚Äù Purav said he would sell his land only if at least one of his two
unemployed sons was promised a government job.

Protests against land acquisitions are common in India as tens of millions of
farmers till small holdings. A planned $44 billion refinery to be run by a
consortium including Saudi Aramco, the world‚Äôs biggest oil producer, is also
struggling to secure land in Maharashtra.

‚ÄúLand acquisition for any project is complex in India,‚Äù said Dhananjay Kumar,
spokesman for the National High Speed Rail Corp Ltd (NHSRCL) that is
overseeing the project. ‚ÄúHere also we are facing difficulty because of so much
resistance.‚Äù

Failure to procure the bullet train land by the deadline would delay disbursal
of soft-loans by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a government
development body, which is reviewing the project next month, said two senior
officials with the state-run

Indian Railways

, declining to be named.

A JICA spokeswoman said that India must create relocation plans for local
residents and make them public in order to enter into a loan agreement
covering the main part of the bullet train project.

‚ÄúIt is possible that it takes time to sign a contract as India takes proper
and careful measures in line with JICA‚Äôs guidelines for environmental and
social considerations,‚Äù she said.

To assuage Japan‚Äôs concerns, Indian officials have sought a meeting this month
with transport ministry officials in Tokyo, one of the Indian officials said.
The government wants the project‚Äôs completion target to be advanced by a year
to 2022, the 75th year of India‚Äôs independence.

A Japanese transport ministry official who deals with the bullet train project
said that Indian officials had told them that ‚Äúthey can manage‚Äù the land
acquisition.

‚ÄúWe will continue to work together with the Indian government to bring this
project forward with an aim to start operation in 2023,‚Äù the official said.

**

‚ÄúNOT INSURMOUNTABLE‚Äù

  
  
**

Japan is majority-funding the train project through a 50-year loan. Japanese
companies such as Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, JFE Holdings, Kawasaki
Heavy Industries,

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries

,

Toshiba

Corp and Hitachi are likely to supply at least 70 per cent of the core
components of the rail line, sources told Reuters in January.

Modi has called the project crucial for his pet ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù campaign aimed
at lifting the share of manufacturing in India‚Äôs $2 trillion economy. The
government also hopes to generate hundreds of jobs through the train project,
and hence is pushing hard to finish it on time.

To sweeten the terms for people opposed to selling their land, Indian Railways
has put its weight behind NHSRCL, pledging funds from its own welfare scheme
to build schools and community halls, one of the officials said.

Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Indian Railway Board, said the issues with
farmers were not insurmountable.

The government has offered to buy land at a 25 per cent premium to the market
value, the two government officials said. Farmers are also being offered
resettlement dues of Rs 5 lakh or 50 per cent of the land value, whichever is
higher.

However, local political opposition in Palghar, ahead of a general election
next year, has fanned the protests. Opponents say the bullet train is wasteful
and the money would be better used upgrading the country‚Äôs rickety rail
infrastructure. Farmers have threatened a hunger strike.

Last week, farmers and local activists disrupted a public hearing conducted by
NHSRCL, its second attempt to hold such an event in less than a month. The
first one last month was also cut short by protests.

‚ÄúIn coming weeks, we will intensify the protests,‚Äù said Nilam Gorhe, a
spokesman for

Shiv Sena

, a party which shares an on-off relationship with the BJP.

**Rahul Gandhi Pleads ""Not Guilty"" In Defamation Case Filed By RSS Leader** 

 ______ 
Rahul Gandhi outside Bhiwandi court.

**Bhiwandi: **

Rahul Gandhi today pleaded ""not guilty"", as charges were framed against him by
a judge in a defamation case filed by an RSS leader in Maharashtra. He will
face trial on the charge of harming the reputation of the RSS or Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the ruling BJP.

""(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi won't speak a word on inflation and fuel price
hike. They have been slapping cases on me, but my fight is based on ideology,
I will fight against them and we will win,"" Rahul Gandhi told reporters after
the hearing.

The Congress President has been sued over his comments at a rally before the
2014 election blaming the RSS for Mahatma Gandhi's assassination in 1948. The
case was filed by an RSS worker, Rajesh Kunte. In 2016, he was granted bail by
the court in Bhiwandi, which is around 32 km from Mumbai.

Mr Gandhi arrived in court this morning surrounded by heavy security; he was
greeted by slogan-shouting Congress workers.

As he took the stand, judge AI Sheikh said: ""On March 6, 2014 in a rally held
for elections at Bhiwandi, you defamed the organisation to which the
complainant belongs. Your speech, which was telecast on channels and also
published in newspapers, damaged the reputation of the complainant and his
organization and you thereby committed an offence under sections 499 and 500
of IPC (defamation). Do you plead guilty?""

The 47-year-old replied, ""I plead not guilty"".

The RSS is the ideological mentor of the BJP (Reuters)

The Congress President had in 2016 requested the Supreme Court to dismiss the
case but he later withdrew the petition, telling the court that he was ready
to be tried on charges of defaming the RSS. The RSS had said at the time it
could drop the suit if Mr Gandhi stated publicly that he does not blame it as
an institution for the death of the Mahatma. Mr Gandhi, however, told the
court that it is not an option.

__ Comments

""I stand by each and every word. I will never take my words back... I am ready
to go to trial,"" Mr Gandhi had said.

On a two-day visit to Maharashtra, Mr Gandhi is expected to address party
workers in Mumbai and interact with corporators in the Brihanmumbai Municipal
Corporation or BMC.

**RBI Chief Questioned By MPs On Supervision Fail In Nirav Modi Scandal** 

 ______ 
RBI Governor Urjit Patel appeared before the parliament's standing committee
on finance

**New Delhi: **

RBI governor Urjit Patel today faced tough questions on the Nirav Modi scam
when he faced a group of parliamentarians to brief them on the banking sector
crises. The RBI governor was appearing before the parliament's standing
committee on finance headed by Congress's Veerappa Moily, which includes
leaders from several parties besides former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Sources have told NDTV that the lawmakers grilled the regulator on the scale
of the PNB (Punjab National Bank) scam that took place despite the Reserve
Bank of India's checks and balances and raised questions on the quality of
monitoring.

On the panel's agenda is to question the RBI chief on the impact of
demonetisation and bad loans, specifically the Rs 13,000 crore-PNB fraud.

Celebrity jeweller

Nirav Modi fled India in January

nearly a fortnight before PNB, India's second-largest government bank,
detected the fraud. Nirav Modi allegedly managed thousands of crores in loans
he never paid back, using fake guarantees supplied by PNB officials at a
branch on Mumbai.

PNB fraud: Nirav Modi has refused to return to India despite multiple summons
by the CBI, and is believed to be trying for political asylum in the UK.

The billionaire, who has refused to return to India despite multiple summons
by the CBI, is believed to be

trying for political asylum

in the UK.

Sources say a senior parliamentarian questioned Urjit Patel how Nirav Modi
managed his illegal transactions for several years ""despite the RBI's
supervisory norms"". Mr Patel was also asked who was accountable for the
failure.

How were fake LoUs (Letters of Undertaking) going around for several years and
why did the RBI fail to notice, Mr Patel was asked by MPs. ""Why didn't RBI
check the credentials? RBI has powers to check and investigate every branch
anywhere. Why didn't it use the power?"" the RBI chief was asked by a senior
parliamentarian.

PNB scam: The state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) was hit with a Rs 13,000
crore earlier this year

Nirav Modi and his relative Mehul Choksi, also accused of fraud, have refused
to join the investigations claiming business engagements and health issues.

Mehul Choksi is reported to be in New York, where he was allegedly seen
enjoying a meal in a lavish upmarket restaurant but his exact location remains
unknown.

The CBI has asked the Interpol to issue a Red Corner Notice against the two,
which means member countries can arrest and deport or extradite them.

__ Comments

Nirav Modi was last publicly seen in a Press Information Bureau group
photograph of CEOs and senior executives of top companies with Prime Minister
Narendra Modi at Davos, Switzerland in late January.

A week later, the CBI registered an FIR against the two, among others, on the
basis of a complaint from the PNB, they said.

**Arrests in Bhima-Koregaon case show RSS and far-right now enjoy impunity** 

 ______ 
Written by

Vivek Deshpande

Updated: June 7, 2018 10:11:00 am

the Bhima-Koregaon violence that followed. (Source: Express photo by Prashant
Nadkar)

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once observed that Left-wing extremism is
the greatest internal security threat to India. After the growing perception
about the spread of vigilantism and violence against Muslims and Dalits in the
country over the past four years, Singh would be tempted to revisit his
impression.

The unleashing of the latent far-right forces during the four years under the
new dispensation ‚Äì led by the BJP at Centre as well as in majority of the BJP-
ruled states ‚Äì should make everyone sit up, and take a serious look at the
whole internal security scenario. Of course, the government won‚Äôt do that ‚Äì
they are from the same fraternity. So, the responsibility of reassessment
rests entirely with the opposition parties, and civil society.

The Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad had taken up the responsibility of
‚Äúparakram‚Äù and ‚Äúpurusharth‚Äù (manly valour), even as the RSS remained the
fountainhead of supportive thoughts and alibis.

What we need to understand is the fundamental difference between the far-left
and the far-right in terms of their approaches to their programs and agendas.

The far-left is relatively much younger in India compared to the far-right in
terms of basic conceptualisation. The far-right was always a hidden force
within the religious right, that took root in 1925 in the form of Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). For around 50-60 years after its birth, the RSS
preferred working silently on its agenda of ‚ÄúHindu Rashtra‚Äù and ‚ÄúAkhand
Bharat‚Äù, betraying no violent fringe. This despite its basic tenets, as
enunciated in ‚ÄòBunch of Thoughts‚Äô by M S Golwalkar, the second Sarsanghchalak,
were always packed with a potentially violent punch.

The various ‚Äúself-defence‚Äù exercises performed as a precursor to any big RSS
event, the regimented route marches et al are anything but a symbol of
peaceful means to usher in change.

The reason for the silence wasn‚Äôt that the RSS had decided to stay away from
violence as a tool to usher in the envisaged change. On the contrary, the RSS
had always openly advocated the primacy of wielding arms through rituals like
‚Äú_shastrapuja_‚Äù (obeisance to arms) on the day of its establishment, that is
the Vijaya Dashmi. The various ‚Äúself-defence‚Äù exercises performed as a
precursor to any big RSS event, the regimented route marches et al are
anything but a symbol of peaceful means to usher in change. Its leaders had
openly exhorted swayamsevaks to be ready to perform ‚Äúparakram‚Äù (valour) after
centuries of subjugation by invaders. Behind the exhortation was the deep-
seated sense of victimhood and inferiority complex caused by what V D Savarkar
had described as ‚Äú_sadgun vikruti_‚Äù (perverted goodness). It was obvious that
such a sense would always the sow seeds of a violent reaction, euphemised in
the term ‚Äúparakram‚Äù.

Behind RSS‚Äôs self-defence exhortation was the deep-seated sense of victimhood
and inferiority complex caused by what V D Savarkar had described as ‚Äúsadgun
vikruti‚Äù (perverted goodness).

But since the overwhelming population of Hindus followed the Gandhian model of
secularism, that had no place for reprisal against ‚Äúrepressive Muslims‚Äù in
principle and practice, the RSS found support only from a section of caste
Hindus. The vast majority of Hindus continued to remain secular. Despite its
dogged, and best efforts, the RSS couldn‚Äôt make decisive inroads into the
Hindu swathes to be able to call the shots. However, its political wing, the
BJP, had started making strides forward, riding the well-orchestrated Ram
temple wave from the 1980s till the turn of the twenty-first century. The
RSS‚Äôs dream of ruling the country came true after the Vajpayee-led NDA
government came to power. That joy, however, was short-lived as Vajpayee, and
even Advani, didn‚Äôt encourage the RSS and its fringes to have any say in the
day-to-day governance. The divorce was written on the wall with then
Sarsanghchalak K S Sudarshan openly rebuking the two leaders and asking them
to step down.

The RSS‚Äôs dream of ruling the country came true after the Vajpayee-led NDA
government came to power.

The RSS had to then wait for 10 long years to see a revival in its fortunes,
when Narendra Modi managed to upstage the Congress to win a full majority.
With no compulsions of coalition politics, and a hardliner Hindutva leader at
the helm, the RSS and its _parivar_ sensed its first opportunity to assert
itself. What we have witnessed over the past four years is the virulent
expression of the suppressed frustration of Hindutva hardliners.

But this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible had the _parivar_ not kept its foot
soldiers ready for such an eventuality. It had given rise to organisations
like the Bajrang Dal to outsource physical violence. The Bajrang Dal and
Vishwa Hindu Parishad had taken up the responsibility of ‚Äú_parakram_‚Äù and
‚Äú_purusharth_‚Äù (manly valour), even as the RSS remained the fountainhead of
supportive thoughts and alibis.

Clearly, the RSS took every precaution not to be seen as being involved in any
physical engagement anywhere. With its political wing coming to power, its
far-right fringe has finally stepped on the gas, with the powers-that-be
giving them a free run. Thus, India‚Äôs far-right nursed and nurtured by the RSS
while serving as its democratic ‚Äú_mukhauta_‚Äù has managed to finally ride
roughshod over Constitutional mechanisms designed to usher in real democracy.
It had the patience to wait for its turn to rule, coming to power through the
perfectly legitimate means of electoral democracy, before forcing its agenda
through a strident expression of its ideology. Thus, the use of Constitutional
mechanisms preceded violent manifestations of the far-right.

And as we now discover, there is no such thing as a fringe here. With its
ministers, Chief Ministers, Governors, MPs and MLAs on record espousing the
far-right agenda, there is room to believe that the fringe is now the
mainstream. The clinching fact about the self-styled ‚Äúcultural‚Äù Right being,
by its very conviction, fringe to the core is borne out by several instances
of violence by its foot-soldiers and supporters, as also by the official
machinery, like the several encounters in UP.

One thing that was common to both the far-right and the far-left was their
dislike of Mahatma Gandhi.

The far-left modus operandi has been the opposite. They started off with open
violence as its main vehicle of change. It openly disregarded the
representative form of democracy, thus inviting only general disdain from the
masses, to whom its violent mainstream always appeared a detestable face.
Though much more meaningful and relevant to genuine issues faced by the
masses, their ideological core of thoughts always remained a deterrent to a
majority, who wouldn‚Äôt accept violence for any cause, however noble. As a
result, their sphere of influence remained much smaller than the one now
occupied by the far-right.

One thing that was common to both the far-right and the far-left was their
dislike of Mahatma Gandhi. The massive sway of Gandhain secularism and non-
violence over Indian people of all castes and religions, for several decades
even after his death, kept both the far-right and far-left at bay. But the
far-right, which was earlier embedded inside and now openly rides on the back
of its outwardly mild patriarch, has managed to use the Constitutional means
to get to where it had always wanted to. The far-left, though it has used the
Constitutional means to claim benefits it didn‚Äôt deserve, finds itself getting
further marginalised due to its firm non-belief in the Constitution.

So has left-wing extremism remained the biggest internal security threat to
India? Or its place has been taken by the far-right or, should we say right-
wing extremism? If yes, then who takes care of that, with the current
dispensation positioning itself in a supportive role? Left-wing extremism
forces have a government to deal with. The same can‚Äôt be said of right-wing
extremism in the current circumstances.

This is borne out by the fact that in the Bhima-Koregaon incident, the
Maharashtra police arrested alleged Naxal supporters, who they say instigated
the programme to commemorate 200 years of Dalit soldiers‚Äô valour against the
Peshwas, while fighting as part of British forces. But they haven‚Äôt yet acted
against Bhide Guruji, allegedly behind the violence that followed. The support
from Hindu Ekta Manch to the accused in Kathua rape and murder, voices of
support and justification for shameful incidents like killing of Muslims by
vigilantes, and the perpetrators going scot-free, only shows that far-right
enjoys impunity in the prevailing socio-political scenario, which the far-left
never could and never probably will .

**‚ÄòCongress-mukt Bharat‚Äô means getting rid of party‚Äôs culture, democracy not possible without Opposition: Amit Shah** 

 ______ 
BJP chief Amit Shah on Monday asserted that the opposition has a key role in a
democracy and said his party‚Äôs slogan of ‚ÄúCongress-free India‚Äù means freeing
the country of that party‚Äôs ‚Äúculture‚Äù.

He also said his some of the remarks on Congress president Rahul Gandhi should
not be taken as a personal attack as he had only replied to certain questions
posed by the opposition party leader.

‚Äú‚ÄòCongress-mukt Bharat‚Äô means getting rid of the ‚ÄòCongress culture‚Äô. Democracy
is not possible without the opposition. It is a different thing that the
Congress has been shrinking in the country,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut it is the responsibility of Rahul Gandhi to keep the Congress alive, not
mine,‚Äù Shah said, when asked if the BJP wanted to wipe out the opposition from
the country.

He was addressing a press conference at Ambikapur town in Chhattisgarh‚Äôs
Surguja district before leaving for New Delhi after his two-day visit to the
city.

To a query on constantly targeting Gandhi in his speeches, Shah said, ‚ÄúIt
should not be considered as a personnel attack. He (Rahul) put forth some
questions to which I answered.‚Äù

The BJP has done good work and therefore, it is getting support of the people.
‚ÄúIf we continue doing good work, people will continue to support us,‚Äù he said.

He said Gandhi was asked to give an account of the four-generation rule of his
family as it was in power for 55 years.

‚ÄúBeing the present party chief, Rahul Gandhi had to answer about the Congress
legacy and I have to answer on the BJP‚Äôs legacy. It should happen in a
democracy and there should be no objection over it,‚Äù the BJP president said.

To a question on the middle class apparently distancing itself from the Modi
government, he said the Centre has been working while keeping in mind benefits
of all sections of society and a propaganda was being spread that the middle
class has turned away from the BJP.

‚ÄúThe party won elections with the support of the middle class in 14 states,‚Äù
he noted.

Shah also highlighted the benefits and achievements of various schemes
launched during the four-year rule of the NDA government at the Centre led by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He said maximum number of terrorists were killed in the last four years while
(international) borders were protected.

The government has a better Kashmir policy and has been keeping an eye on the
situation in the valley, he said.

Shah took a jibe at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying when he used
to go on foreign tours, nobody knew about it but when PM Modi goes abroad, ‚Äúhe
is welcomed‚Äù by people of those countries and Indians based there.

Hailing Chief Minister Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh, Shah
said it has transformed a backward state into a developed one.

Chhattisgarh was part of the erstwhile Madhya Pradesh. In 1980s, Madhya
Pradesh was recognised as a ‚ÄòBimaru‚Äô state as a result of long rule of the
Congress. When Chhattisgarh was formed and the BJP came to power in 2003, it
rapidly headed on the path of development and made its way into the list of
developed states, Shah said.

Chhattisgarh has now become a power surplus state, Naxalism has been
controlled, road network is being laid, agriculture production increased, and
transport and communication services expanded in remote areas, he mentioned.

Naya Raipur - the upcoming capital of the state - is being built and many more
development works have been done by the Raman Singh government, he said,
claiming that several state governments were taking lessons from Chhattisgarh.

The senior BJP leader exuded confidence that his party would retain power for
the fourth straight term in the state, in the Assembly elections due later
this year.

Shah said after witnessing a huge response during his programme in Ambikapur
yesterday, he was confident that the BJP will achieve the target of clinching
65 out of 90 seats in the state Assembly polls.

The BJP chief yesterday arrived on the visit of Ambikapur. He had held a road
show in the town followed by addressing a public meeting as a part of Raman
Singh‚Äôs ‚ÄòVikas Yatra‚Äô campaign to highlight achievements of the 15-year rule
of his government, ahead of polls in the state.

**RBI Chief Questioned By MPs On Supervision Fail In Nirav Modi Scandal** 

 ______ 
RBI Governor Urjit Patel appeared before the parliament's standing committee
on finance

**New Delhi: **

Facing tough questions from parliamentarians on the Nirav Modi scam and bad
loans hitting state-run lenders, RBI Governor Urjit Patel said today that the
regulator had limited powers to act against public sector banks like Punjab
National Bank (PNB).

""They are not completely under our control and we have no role in removal or
appointing the chairman and managing directors, granting licenses and a host
of other measures. We have asked Government to give us more powers to exercise
control over public sector banks,"" said the RBI governor, appearing before the
Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance.

The committee headed by Congress's Veerappa Moily includes leaders from
several parties besides former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

PNB fraud: Nirav Modi has refused to return to India despite multiple summons
by the CBI

Sources have told NDTV that the lawmakers grilled the regulator on the Rs
13,000 crore PNB fraud that they said took place despite the RBI's checks and
balances and raised questions on the quality of monitoring.

Celebrity jeweller

Nirav Modi fled India in January

nearly a fortnight before PNB, India's second-largest government bank,
detected the fraud. Nirav Modi allegedly managed thousands of crores in loans
he never paid back, using fake guarantees supplied by PNB officials at a
branch on Mumbai.

The billionaire, who has refused to return to India despite multiple summons
by the CBI, is believed to be

trying for political asylum in the UK

.

Sources say a senior parliamentarian questioned Urjit Patel how Nirav Modi
managed his illegal transactions for several years ""despite the RBI's
supervisory norms"". Mr Patel was also asked who was accountable for the
failure.

PNB scam: The state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) was hit with a Rs 13,000
crore earlier this year

How were fake LoUs (Letters of Undertaking) going around for several years and
why did the RBI fail to notice, Mr Patel was asked by MPs. ""Why didn't RBI
check the credentials? RBI has powers to check and investigate every branch
anywhere. Why didn't it use the power,"" the RBI chief was asked by a senior
parliamentarian.

Blaming PNB and its directors for the scandal, Mr Patel replied that the RBI
had no option but to rely on the internal control system of banks. ""We do not
constitute an audit of banks and do not seek to replace it, this was
consciously done,"" he told the MPs.

Mr Patel said PNB furnished a ""factually incorrect compliance report"" that
measures had been implemented, even after the RBI had cautioned banks
confidentially about similar fraud in another bank.

__ Comments

The CBI has asked the Interpol to issue a Red Corner Notice against Nirav
Modi, which means member countries can arrest and deport or extradite him.

There are 21 state-owned banks, including the State Bank of India. Their
combined losses crossed Rs 87,300 crore this year, topped by PNB. Only two
banks, Indian Bank and Vijaya Bank, posted profits.

**Spiritual Leader Bhaiyyu Maharaj Commits Suicide By Shooting Himself In Head** 

 ______ 
Bhaiyyu Maharaj is known for his links with influential politicians and
businessmen

**New Delhi: **

Bhaiyyu Maharaj, a popular spiritual leader who counted some of the country's
top politicians and celebrities among his followers, committed suicide on
Tuesday by shooting himself in the head at his ashram in Madhya Pradesh's
Indore.

Bhaiyyuji Maharaj, born Uday Sinh Deshmukh

, allegedly shot himself over ""domestic issues"". The police have reportedly
found a suicide note that indicated that the 50-year-old was ""depressed"". He
was declared dead at the Bombay hospital in Indore.

""The country has lost a person who was a confluence of culture, knowledge and
selfless service,"" said Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan,
who had provoked opposition anger earlier this year by appointing Bhaiyyu
Maharaj and four other ""sadhus"" as ministers.

Bhaiyyu Maharaj had refused the government's offer

, saying ""a post has no importance to a saint"". Lacerated by the opposition,
the state government justified the controversial move saying the gurus were
made ministers to facilitate their work as members of a committee for the
conservation of the river Narmada.

File photo of PM Narendra Modi with Bhaiyyu Maharaj

The self-styled guru was known for his links with influential politicians and
businessmen. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and legendary singer
Lata Mangeshkar were among his many followers.

During the India Against Corruption campaign of 2011 for a Lokpal or anti-
corruption watchdog, the Congress-led government sent Bhaiyyu Maharaj to
persuade Anna Hazare to end his fast. Anna Hazare finally accepted a glass of
juice from him.

Bhaiyyu Maharaj was also invited by Narendra Modi when, as Chief Minister of
Gujarat, he sat on a ""Sadbhavna (harmony) fast"".

Popular mainly in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the guru announced in 2016
that he would give up public life. Scores of his supporters were seen outside
the hospital where he was taken today.

__ Comments

Last year, Bhaiyyu Maharaj married Ayushi Sharma, a doctor. His first wife
died two years before.

""We are sad. Why did he have to commit suicide? A probe is necessary. We don't
know what happened,"" said Computer Baba, another Madhya-Pradesh based
spiritual leader recommended for a ministerial post by the state government.

**World's fastest growth yet to make a mark on India's job market** 

 ______ 
Hiring in India‚Äôs formal job market remained stagnant even as growth
accelerated at the fastest pace among the world‚Äôs biggest economies.

A survey of 5,110 employers conducted by

Manpower Group

found 16 percent planned to increase their workforce in the quarter ending
September. It includes companies in the formal sector, who employ 10 or more
workers. Data on India‚Äôs informal labor market, which employs the majority of
its workers, is limited.

""Major trends that will drive recruitment in 2018 in India are diversity,
automated recruitment, virtual reality, remote working options,"" AG Rao, group
managing director of Manpower Group India said in a statement Tuesday. The
service sector and wholesale and retail trade are expected to have the
strongest outlook, with 20 percent of respondents saying they planned to hire
in the September quarter.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government is counting on high levels of
economic growth to deliver jobs before the country heads for elections in
2019. Gross domestic product growth has accelerated in each of the last four
quarters, hitting 7.7 percent for the quarter ending March.

Before sweeping to power in 2014, Modi appealed to young job-seekers with a
promise to create 10 million jobs. Four years later it remains unclear how
many positions have been created. More than 12 million Indians enter the
workforce every year, government data show.

Though the rate of hiring isn‚Äôt increasing dramatically, neither are large
numbers of jobs being lost, data indicates. The

unemployment

rate fell to 5.29 percent in May from 5.64 percent the previous month, data
compiled by Center for Monitoring

Indian Economy

show, which is the lowest since January. India does not have official
government data on unemployment available for 2018.

""A large part of the acceleration in recent quarters comes from increased
public administration spending,"" said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive officer at
CMIE. ""This is not sustainable and so there are inherent limits in the nature
of the current growth.""

# NDA government built 73 pct more highways than UPA‚Äôs last 4 years

## The Narendra Modi government has built around 73% more national highways in
its first four years till 2017-18 compared with the last four years‚Äô in office
of the previous UPA dispensation beginning 2010-11.

(EPC) route wherein the government bears all project cost. (Reuters)

The Narendra Modi government has built around 73% more national highways in
its first four years till 2017-18 compared with the last four years‚Äô in office
of the previous UPA dispensation beginning 2010-11. The present government has
constructed a total of 28,531 km national highways in its four years since
2014-15 as against 16,505 km by the previous government in four years till
2013-14.

One of the priority areas, the highway construction, under the present
dispensation, grew over the years to touch its highest in 2017-18 at 9,829 km
followed by 8,231 km in 2016-17. The government had built 6,061 km national
highways in 2015-16 and 4,410 km in 2014-15. On the other hand, in 2010-11, a
total 4,500 km highways was constructed, 2,013 km in 2011-12, 5,732 km in
2012-13 and 4,260 km in 2010-11.

While the NDA government‚Äôs construction averaged at 19.5 km a day since
2014-15, the UPA‚Äôs average was 11.27 km from 2010-11 to 2013-14. When the
Narendra Modi government took over in May 2014, the construction rate stood at
11.67 km per day. Under the new regime, it grew to 12 km per day in 2014-15,
16.6 km per day in 2015-16, touching a record 22.5 km per day in 2016-17 and
even better at 26.9 km in 2017-18.

For the current fiscal, the Nitin Gadkari-led ministry has set an ambitious
target of building 45 km/day. Of the 16,418 km construction target in the
whole of 2018-19, the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), which
builds national highways through state PWDs, will build 9,698 km followed by
National Highways Authority of India at 6,000 km and National Highways
Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL) has been entrusted with the
target of building 720 km.

MoRTH implements projects via the engineering, procurement and construction
(EPC) route wherein the government bears all project cost. NHAI projects are
increasingly being built through the hybrid annuity model (HAM), an improved
public-private partnership model in which the government bears 40% of the
project cost. This innovative financial model also came up during the current
regime.

Apart from this, the Modi government has taken several steps to address the
problems coming in the way of highway development. It has eased the exit
policy for developers to enable them invest in new projects, expedited land
acquisition, introduced one-time fund infusion scheme in languishing projects
and others.

The award of highway projects, during the first four years of the NDA regime,
also more than doubled to stand at 51,073 km compared with a total of 25,158
km done by the UPA government in its last four years. The target for awards in
2018-19 has been set at 20,000 km, which is about 25% more than 17,055 km
awarded during 2017-18.

**Projects worth Rs 1.85 lakh cr awarded under Sagarmala by March 2018** 

 ______ 
Projects worth Rs 1.85 lakh crore have been awarded under the ambitious port-
led development programme

Sagarmala

by March 2018, the government said today.

The Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

, in 2015 had given in principle nod to the

project

which was launched in 2016.

A total of 224 projects -- entailing an investment to the tune of Rs 1.85 lakh
crore -- were launched by March 31, 2018, Ministry of Shipping said in a
statement.

It said 196 projects worth Rs 71,868 lakh crores are expected to be awarded in
2018-19.

Ninety-eight projects worth Rs 31,046 crore expected to be completed in
2018-19, the statement said, adding that 59 projects worth Rs 11,299 crore
have been completed till March 31, 2018.

""These include various infrastructure projects, coastal berth projects,
fishery harbours and skill development projects. These projects are being
implemented by relevant Central Ministries, State Governments, Ports and other
agencies primarily through the private or PPP mode.

""These include unique and innovative projects like Gogha-Dahej RO-Pax Ferry
Services Project and RO-RO Services Project at Mandwa,"" the statement said.

In addition, TEFR (techno economic feasibility report) is under preparation
for development of underwater viewing gallery and restaurant at BeytDwarka
Island and the consultant has been selected for preparing DPR (detailed
project report) for the National Maritime Heritage Centre proposed at Lothal,
it said.

As part of Sagarmala, 572 projects, at an estimated infrastructure investment
of more than Rs 8.4 lakh crore, have been identified across the areas of port
modernisation and new port development, port connectivity enhancement, port-
linked industrialisation and coastal community development.

These projects will be implemented by relevant Central ministries, state
governments, ports and other agencies primarily through the private or PPP
mode, the government said.

To assist in implementation of projects, Sagarmala Development Company Limited
(SDCL) was incorporated earlier for providing funding support to project SPVs
(special purpose vehicles) and residual projects under Sagarmala.

in the past four years, according to an estimate by the

road transport ministry

.

While during 2013-14, only 45,600 man-days of jobs were generated due to
highway construction it increased to about 1.1 lakh during last fiscal year.

Moreover, the central guidelines for growth of taxi aggregators has created

**Modi against babudom: PM's relentless struggle to reform bureaucracy** 

 ______ 
Narendra Modi

government has just taken its most revolutionary step to reform
bureaucracy‚Äîthe

lateral entry

scheme. For long, a lot of people have argued for such a step. It is seen as
an effective measure to energise age-old babudom notorious for its lack of
innovation and drive. If you are a private sector professional above 40 years
of age and with 15 years of work experience in any of the ten fields like
economic affairs, civil aviation or commerce, the government may hire you as a
joint secretary.

This is not the only step Modi has taken to reform bureaucracy. He has been at
it for long and has tried hard. Unlike other reforms, his project to reform
bureaucracy becomes more difficult because it's the very bureaucracy that has
to implement these reforms.

So far, Modi's most controversial step in this direction is the 360-degree
review or appraisal system to select, promote and even indirectly admonish
officials. This has essentially reduced the reliance on annual confidential
reports as the key basis for shortlisting and empanelment. This, in turn, has
a significant bearing on the final selection of a bureaucrat to a top job. The
appraisal includes assessing bureaucrats on integrity and reputation through a
comprehensive background check, before the are empanelled for top

jobs

. For an all-round view, the appraisal c considers views of an officer's
seniors as well as juniors in addition to anonymous views of different
stakeholders.

However, the appraisal system has drawn criticism, even from a parliamentary
panel for being opaque, non-transparent, and subjective. The panel had
objected that feedback in this process was obtained informally, making the
process susceptible to being manipulated.

This group is expected to work pretty much independently, collecting
information from myriad sources in an unsuspecting, unassuming manner,
figuring out the general reputation of the officer among subordinate staff,
paint an overall perception picture on integrity, besides making any other
relevant observations.

The government is using a unique system‚ÄîSparrow (Smart performance appraisal
report recording online window)‚Äîto make the entire appraisal system online and
accessible for review by the ministries concerned. The Department of Personnel
and Training last year extended 'Sparrow' from just the IAS cadre to other
cadres. The government's another online system to track babudom is a DoPT
portal, 'Solve', a system for online vigilance enquiry for board-level
appointees.

Another step against bureaucrats that hit the headlines was compulsory
retirement. The Department of Personnel and Training has taken actions like
premature retirement and salary cut against hundreds of officers‚Äî24 of whom
were from IAS‚Äîfor non-performance and corruption. The government has also
compulsorily retired a few IPS officers for non-performance.

MUMBAI: The grand alliance of opposition parties to take on the BJP and Prime
Minister Narendra Modi is not just the sentiment of politicians but also of
the people, Congress president

Rahul Gandhi

said today.

The Congress, he said, is trying to join together these voices and the work is
going on.

""It is the sentiment of the people and not just political parties which are
opposed to the BJP, to have a mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) that can take
on the BJP, the RSS and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" he said at a press
conference here.

""Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are attacking the Constitution and
institutions of the nation,"" he alleged, saying the question facing the people
is how to stop this.

He said the opposition has been asking Prime Minister Modi to bring prices of
petrol and diesel under the Goods and Services Tax (GST), but ""he is not
interested.""

""There was an attack on Mumbai (through demonetisation). There are small
industries, traders here... The leather industry and the cloth industry. They
were attacked through the 'Gabbar Singh Tax'. The whole country is sad. Small
businessmen are sad and we are fighting for them,"" he said.

He said during the UPA government's rule, the crude price was $130 a barrel
that has now come down to USD 70 a barrel.

""However, the benefit has not been passed on to the common man. Where does
this money go? In the pockets of 15 to 20 rich people,"" Gandhi alleged.

The 47-year-old Congress president is on a two-day visit to Maharashtra since
yesterday.

**‚ÄòUFO‚Äô sighted near PM Modi‚Äôs house on June 7, search finds nothing** 

 ______ 
_(Video by NDTV)_

The reported sighting of a round ‚Äúunidentified flying object‚Äù hovering over
the Prime Minister‚Äôs residence on New Delhi‚Äôs Lok Kalyan Marg on June 7
briefly unnerved security personnel posted in the VIP area and sparked a
search that found nothing, putting their suspicions to rest, a senior security
officer said.

After the search ended, the Perimeter Security Officer gave an ‚ÄúOK Report‚Äù to
Delhi police.

**Plot to kill PM Modi: What all we know till now**

Special commissioner of police and Delhi police chief spokesperson Dependra
Pathak confirmed the sighting but said details of the incident cannot be
revealed. ‚ÄúThe sighting was reported but nothing threatening was found. More
details cannot be shared keeping security reasons in mind,‚Äù Pathak added.

According to the officer cited in the first instance, who did not wish to be
named, it was around 7.30 pm when the PM‚Äôs security unit of Delhi Police and
the Delhi airport operations control centre, which comprises staff from the
air force, Central Industrial Security Force and Delhi International Airport
Ltd, received information about the sighting by Special Protection Group (SPG)
personnel.

With no delay, the alert was relayed to the Intelligence Bureau and National
Security Guards. Delhi Air Traffic Control (ATC) was also put on high alert.

‚ÄúThe Delhi Police was also roped in, which ensured a temporary additional
deployment on the outer periphery of the PM‚Äôs residence, while other security
agencies performed the drill to hunt the suspected threat down,‚Äù the officer
cited above said.

It isn‚Äôt the first time that such an incident has taken place. On September
17, 2017, around 10pm, the Delhi police security control room was informed
about the sighting of a drone-like object around the Parliament area. But no
object was captured on the ATC‚Äôs radar, which cannot capture small flying
objects in any case.

In the same month, the Delhi Police control room informed ATC about the
presence of a drone-like flying object over a hospital in a southern suburb. A
search found nothing.

In November, the ministry of civil aviation unveiled draft regulations for use
of drones in the country. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation is
awaiting a response from the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of
defence to finalise guidelines for the use of drones.

# Nirav Modi used revoked passport four times to travel: Interpol

## In a June 5 letter to Indian agencies, Interpol said Nirav Modi travelled
between United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong on his Indian passport
between March 15 and March 31.

PNB Fraud Case: Earlier this week, the CBI moved Interpol to issue Red Corner
Notices against Nirav and Choksi.

The Interpol has informed Indian investigation agencies that absconding
diamond jeweller Nirav Modi travelled four times between three countries as
recently as March on an Indian passport that was revoked by the Ministry of
External Affairs (MEA) on February 24, sources have told The Indian Express.

In a June 5 letter to Indian agencies, Interpol said Nirav travelled between
United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong on his Indian passport between
March 15 and March 31. According to Interpol, he travelled four times on that
passport ‚Äî on March 15, March 28, March 30 and March 31.

**READ | Others in family helped Nirav launder money, destroy evidence, ED tells court**

On February 24, the MEA revoked the passports of Nirav and his maternal uncle
Mehul Choksi, promoter of Gitanjali Group, after they failed to respond to a
February 16 notice issued by the Ministry, asking them to show-cause why their
passports should not be impounded or revoked. **READ | How to bring back a
fugitive**

This was after they came under the scanner of multiple investigation agencies
following state-owned Punjab National Bank‚Äôs complaint against their
companies, saying it had been cheated of an estimated Rs 13,500 crore through
fraudulent issue of letters of undertaking (LoUs) and foreign letters of
credit (FLCs).

The passport revocation order can be challenged in Indian courts. But it is
not known if Nirav and Choksi have done that.

**READ | Nirav Modi is in our country, confirms UK minister, assures support to India**

According to norms, once a revocation order is issued by the government, it
has to be communicated to the authority concerned at an airport or any other
point of embarkation or immigration, and to the passport authority.

Emails to the official spokesperson of MEA did not elicit any response.

The Interpol letter to Indian authorities is in response to a diffusion notice
issued by CBI, requesting the Interpol to track Nirav after it registered a
case of alleged fraud against him in January.

**READ | Nirav Modi‚Äôs five dummy firms in Hong Kong whose owners earned Rs 8,000 got Rs 8,000 crore LoUs**

Nirav, his wife Ami (a US citizen), brother Neeshal (a Belgian national) and
uncle Choksi fled the country in the first week of January, weeks before the
scam broke. While Nirav is in the UK, Choksi is learnt to be in the US.
According to sources, Nirav also applied for a permanent residency permit in
Singapore in mid-January.

Earlier this week, the CBI moved Interpol to issue Red Corner Notices against
Nirav and Choksi. Nirav‚Äôs presence in the UK was confirmed by members of the
British delegation led by Minister of State for Countering Extremism, Baroness
Williams, who held deliberations with MoS (Home) Kiren Rijiju in New Delhi on
June 11.

**Wisdom can‚Äôt be inherited, Arun Jaitley tells Rahul Gandhi, mocks Congress‚Äô obsession with Modi** 

 ______ 
By:

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Updated: June 14, 2018 9:33:53 am

The finance minister also took a dig at the Congress party for Narendra Modi
as its ‚Äúonly obsession‚Äù.

In a scathing attack on Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Union Minister Arun
Jaitley on Wednesday questioned his wisdom, saying that it has to be acquired
through learning and cannot be inherited. Jaitley took the jibe at Gandhi in a
Facebook post, lambasting the Congress chief for his anti-Narendra Modi
tirade. The finance minister also took a dig at the Congress party for its
obsession for Narendra Modi.

In his Facebook post, Jaitley said the Congress party has become
‚Äúideologyless‚Äù because its ‚Äúonly obsession is a person called Narendra Modi‚Äù.
Gandhi has been attacking the BJP government for waiving loans of Rs 2.5 lakh
crore by big corporates, and also criticising the Mudra Yojana.

Jaitley said Gandhi prefers the ‚ÄúGobbelian traditions to say the exact
opposite‚Äù, while observing that the UPA government during 2008-2014
indiscriminately lent money through banks to 15 big loan defaulters.

‚ÄúFor a President of a national party not to understand this basic procedure of
bank functioning should be a matter of concern to the entire party as also the
country. In dynastic parties political positions are heritable. Unfortunately
wisdom is not heritable. It has to be acquired through learning,‚Äù he said in a
post titled ‚ÄòIs Congress Becoming Ideologyless? Is Anti-Modism its only
ideology?‚Äô

Jaitley also mocked Gandhi‚Äôs factual inaccuracy regarding the founder of Coca
Cola. ‚ÄúThe great grandson of the man who authored ‚ÄòThe Discovery of India‚Äô
could with his customary inaccuracies one day give to this country his
monumental work on ‚ÄòThe Rediscovery of Coca Cola‚Äô,‚Äù Jaitley said.

**Why is Britain the favourite hiding spot for Indian fugitives?** 

 ______ 
After former IPL administrator

Lalit Modi

and

Vijay Mallya

of Kingfisher Airlines, another scam-accused, diamond trader

Nirav Modi

, is believed to be hiding in the UK. Why did they head to the UK when they
realised they would be caught in

India

? Is UK a safe country for

fugitives

from Indian law? Here's the story:

**Strong human-right laws**

It‚Äôs not just the Modis ‚Äî Nirav and Lalit ‚Äî and the Mallyas of India who have
sought refuge in Queen‚Äôs land. Over 5,500 people from India have sought
political asylum in

Britain

since 2013, not all of them criminals though. UK is a signatory to European
Convention on Human Rights‚Äîif UK courts deem that a person to be extradited is
likely to face torture or death penalty, or the extradition is due to
political reasons, they may deny the extradition request.

**Delay in extradition**

Extradition proceedings are slow in the UK. India has made nine extradition
requests, including one for Vijay Mallya to the UK: for Rajesh Kapoor (2011)
for forgery and fraud, Tiger Hanif (2004) for involvement in terrorism, Atul
Singh (2012) for sex crimes, Raj Kumar Patel (2009) for forgery, Jatinder
Kumar Angurala and Asha Rani Angurala (2014) for bank fraud, Sanjeev Kumar
Chawla (2004) for cricket betting and Shaik Sadiq (2004) for conspiracy and
theft. These requests are still pending in courts.

**Rejected extraditions  
**

The UK has extradited only one Indian ‚Äî Samirbhai Vinubhai Patel in 2016 ‚Äî
since both the countries signed extradition treaty in 1992 even though India
has extradited several British fugitives such as Maninder Pal Singh Kohli in
2007 for murder, Somaia Ketan Surendra in 2009 for cheating and Kulwinder
Singh Uppal in 2013 for kidnapping. The UK has rejected a large number of
extradition requests made by India on different grounds. These include for
Raymond Varley, Ravi Shankaran, Velu Boopalan, Ajay Prasad Khaitan, Virendra
Kumar Rastogi and Anand Kumar Jain.

**""My Fitness Is Karnataka's Fitness,"" Says HD Kumaraswamy On PM's Challenge** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited Karnataka Chief Minister Kumaraswamy to
the #FitnessChallenge

**Bengaluru: **

Invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up a #FitnessChallenge,
Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy responded with, what many thought, a
snub. ""Our government is not individually bothered about fitness issues,"" he
said.

PM Modi, who had been tagged by cricket skipper Virat Kohli, had this morning
tweeted his workout video and passed on the #FitnessChallenge to Mr
Kumaraswamy and two others.

Mr Kumaraswamy's reply came soon after. ""Yoga and treadmill are part of my
daily workout regime,"" he said, asserting that he was ""more concerned about
the development fitness of my state"".

&gt; Dear @narendramodi ji  
&gt; I am honoured&amp;amp; thankU very much for d concern about my health  
&gt; I believe physical fitness is imptnt for all&amp;amp;support d cause. Yoga-
treadmill r part of my daily workout regime.  
&gt; Yet, I am more concerned about devlpment fitness of my state&amp;amp;seek ur
support for it.

&gt;

&gt; \- CM of Karnataka (@CMofKarnataka) June 13, 2018

In the evening, he said: ""PM advised everybody to be fit in their work, for
that I welcome it. In my personal view our government isn't individually
bothered about fitness issue. My fitness is Karnataka's fitness. People have
to be fit in every work, that's my top priority.""

Mr Kumaraswamy was sworn in as Chief Minister on May 23, after PM Modi's BJP,
which failed to win an outright majority, couldn't get the numbers to pass a
floor test.

For days after being sworn in along with a deputy, G Parameswara of the
Congress, the Chief Minister didn't have a cabinet because of a fierce tussle
within the Congress for meaty portfolios.

__ Comments

Earlier this month, after Mr Kumaraswamy met with the Prime Minister, he told
reporters that PM Modi gave him advice based on his experience. The advice was
reportedly to assign portfolios at the soonest and not take any burden.

The #FitnessChallenge was started by Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
on May 22. He threw a challenge at Virat Kohli, who in turn tagged PM Modi.

air force, Central Industrial Security Force and Delhi International Airport
Ltd, received information about the sighting by Special Protection Group (SPG)
personnel.

With no delay, the alert was relayed to the Intelligence Bureau and National
Security Guards. Delhi Air Traffic Control (ATC) was also put on high alert.

‚ÄúThe Delhi Police was also roped in, which ensured a temporary additional
deployment on the outer periphery of the PM‚Äôs residence, while other security
agencies performed the drill to hunt the suspected threat down,‚Äù the officer
cited above said.

It isn‚Äôt the first time that such an incident has taken place. On September
17, 2017, around 10pm, the Delhi police security control room was informed
about the sighting of a drone-like object around the Parliament area. But no
object was captured on the ATC‚Äôs radar, which cannot capture small flying
objects in any case.

In the same month, the Delhi Police control room informed ATC about the
presence of a drone-like flying object over a hospital in a southern suburb. A
search found nothing.

In November, the ministry of civil aviation unveiled draft regulations for use
of drones in the country. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation is
awaiting a response from the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of
defence to finalise guidelines for the use of drones.

**Involvement of the Catholic Church in politics in India ‚Äî a short history**

Delhi Archbishop Anil Couto (seen with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015)
has called for a ‚Äòprayer campaign‚Äô ahead of the elections of 2019. (Photo:

In a pastoral letter released June 3, Archbishop Filipe Neri of Goa and Daman
said ‚Äúa kind of monoculturalism‚Äù had gripped India, and the ‚ÄúConstitution is
in danger‚Äù. Earlier, in a letter written to heads of local churches on May 8,
Archbishop of Delhi Anil Couto had referred to a ‚Äúturbulent political
atmosphere‚Äù that threatened democracy and secularism, and called for a ‚Äúprayer
campaign‚Äù ahead of the 2019 elections.

BJP president Amit Shah criticised Couto‚Äôs letter, saying ‚Äúpolarising people
in the name of religion‚Äù was ‚Äúnot appropriate‚Äù. On June 5, BJP national
general secretary Bhupender Yadav decried on Twitter the ‚Äúpolitical appeal by
a religious head which marks a new dangerous trend‚Äù.

**Church and politics**  
Contrary to Yadav‚Äôs tweet, a ‚Äúpolitical appeal‚Äù by a Christian bishop is not
new. Catholic bishops have from time to time issued guidance and advice that
seemingly crossed the church-state line. Officially, the Church, according to
a pastoral letter written by Matthew Kavukattu, Bishop of Changanacherry
(Syro-Malabar) diocese in Kerala in November 1951, stands for ‚Äúeternal and
spiritual concern‚Äù, but ‚Äúshe neither can nor does ignore temporal matters,
because the world in which we live is the only path leading us to our eternal
home‚Äù.

**READ | Indian Constitution in danger, writes Goa‚Äôs Archbishop**

* Father George Manimala of the Shrine of Our Lady of Health, Masihgarh, Okhla, Delhi, told The Indian Express that back in 1977, a petition had been filed challenging the election of veteran leader K M Mani to the Kerala Assembly on the ground that ‚Äúthe bishop‚Äôs directives (in Pala, Kottayam) had influenced the voting of the faithful‚Äù.

* More recently, in December 2015, Archbishop of the Faridabad-Delhi Syro-Malabar Church Kuriakose Bharanikulangara said in a pastoral letter that the victory of the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar was a verdict against ‚Äúsectarian politics‚Äù and a ‚Äúdeclaration by Indian conscience that it will not support‚Ä¶ religious intolerance and sectarian mindset as campaign tools‚Äù.

* In December 2016, as Goa prepared for Assembly elections, Archbishop Neri said the Church would guide the faithful on voting, prompting the Shiv Sena to file a complaint of ‚Äúinterference‚Äù with the Election Commission.

Goa‚Äôs Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao (Source: YouTube)

* On November 21 last year, ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections, a pastoral letter by Archbishop Thomas Macwan of Gandhinagar spoke of the ‚Äúgrowing sense of insecurity among the religious minorities, OBCs, BCs, poor etc‚Äù, and asked the faithful to save the country from ‚Äúnationalist forces‚Äù by electing those who were ‚Äúfaithful to our Constitution‚Äù. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ‚Äúshocked to see a religious person issuing a fatwa asking for nationalist forces to be uprooted‚Äù, and the Election Commission asked the Archbishop ‚Äúthe intention behind issuing a letter to the community‚Äù. **OPINION | Mis-reading archbishop‚Äôs letter**

In Kerala, where Christians have a strong influence on society, politics and
economy, the Catholic Church has always played a political role. It joined the
1958-59 Vimochana Samaram (‚Äúliberation struggle‚Äù) spearheaded by the Congress,
Nair Service Society and the Muslim League to overthrow the world‚Äôs first
democratically elected communist government of EMS Namboodiripad, and it has
been accused of using CIA funds to fight communism ‚Äî allegations that it has
never been able to convincingly rebut. Ahead of the first general election in
1951-52, Bishop Kavukattu of Changanacherry asked the faithful not to elect
candidates who ‚Äúadhere to the ideology of atheistic communism‚Äù.

**ALSO READ | Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah criticise Delhi Archbishop for 2019 poll remark**

In 1957, before the second general election, the standing committee of the
Catholic Bishops‚Äô Conference of India (CBCI), the apex body of the Catholic
Church in India, issued a statement, to be read out at Sunday mass in churches
across the country, on the ‚Äúgrowing religious intolerance in the states of
Madhya Pradesh and Madhyabharat‚Äù. It was the ‚Äúresponsibility of each Catholic
to‚Ä¶ not vote for any party or individual contesting against God and universal
Church‚Äù, the statement said.

**A fragmented Church**  
It is important to note that the Catholic Church is a highly organised,
hierarchical body with clear jurisdictions ‚Äî so the calls of, say, Archbishop
Couto or Archbishop Neri are addressed only to their committed community, and
are not the official position of the Church as a whole. A political call by an
imam or a Hindu saint is not bound by jurisdiction in the same way, and hence
has wider reach.

Also, the Church in India is not a monolith; Christians are divided into many
denominations and traditions. Within the Catholic Church, the Latin Catholics
are the most numerous, but the Kerala-based Syro-Malabar Church is the most
influential. The RSS backs the Mar Thoma Syrian Church headquartered in
Thiruvalla in Pathanamthitta district as an ‚ÄúIndian Church‚Äù.

**RELATED REPORT | Hindu bodies condemn Goa archbishop‚Äôs ‚Äòconstitution in danger‚Äô remarks**

However, while there is no one ‚ÄòChristian‚Äô voice in Kerala (or India),
Catholics in the state, given their opposition to the Left, have long been
identified with the Congress.

**Struggles within**  
Some see the Archbishops‚Äô outbursts as a reflection of divisions in the
leadership of the Church. The head of the CBCI, Archbishop of Bombay Oswald
Gracias, told The Indian Express that the timing of Archbishop Couto‚Äôs letter
was ‚Äúbad‚Äù, and that he had advised other bishops to refrain from issuing
statements with political connotations.

Both Archbishops Neri and Couto are Goans, and sources within the Church
leadership said the ‚ÄúGoan lobby‚Äù is unhappy about Oswald beating Neri to the
top job at CBCI. Cardinal Oswald has been maintaining cordial relations with
the BJP.

A section in the Church leadership feels Neri and Couto have given ammunition
to elements in the far right to try to consolidate Hindu votes in poll-bound
Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where Sangh Parivar outfits have been
jousting with Christians over conversion in tribal areas.

**Church‚Äôs soft power**  
While Christians are only 2.3% of India‚Äôs population as per the 2011 Census,
the Church owns or controls some 20,000 educational institutions ‚Äî second only
to the central government ‚Äî thousands of vocational training centres, and
around 5,000 healthcare centres. Alumni of church institutions are in several
leadership positions in politics, the bureacuracy and in key government and
non-government bodies, and wield unique influencing and lobbying power.
Through several landmark cases, the Church and Church-run institutions have
played pivotal roles in establishing minority rights in education.

The Church‚Äôs role in the social sector has been deeply contentious. The RSS
sees conversions by Christian missionaries as a cultural war on Hinduism, and
both the Sangh and the Left are critical of the role of the ‚Äúforeign hand‚Äù and
‚Äúforeign money‚Äù in India. Suspicions are fuelled by the seemingly undue
interest taken by predominantly Christian western countries in the central
government‚Äôs assertion of control over the flow of funds to Church-linked
NGOs.

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi government is mulling significant changes in Atal Pension
Yojana (APY), in accordance with fresh proposals sent by Pension Fund
Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).

**Atal Pension Yojana:** PM Narendra Modi government is mulling significant changes in Atal Pension Yojana (APY), in accordance with fresh proposals sent by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). The proposals include: a) increasing the current pension limit of Rs 5000/month under APY to Rs 10,000 per month. b) The PFRDA has also asked the government to consider automatic enrollment of citizens in APY. c) Raising the maximum age bar under the scheme up to 50 years.

At present, the maximum age bar under APY is 40 years. Anyone between 18-40
years of age can subscribe to APY. Also, the current maximum pension limit per
month under APY is Rs 5000. This is provided under five slabs ‚Äì starting from
Rs 1000. Also, the enrollment under APY is not automatic.

At a PFRDA conference on Tuesday, Madnesh Kumar Mishra, Joint Secretary,
Department of Financial Services (DFS), acknowledged the need to increase the
maximum pension amount under APY. ‚ÄúWe have seen the proposal (sent by PFRDA)
of increasing the pension value to (up to) Rs 10,000 per month and it is under
our active examination,‚Äù PTI quoted Mishra as saying on the sidelines of the
event.

According to PFRDY Chairman Hemant G Contractor, the proposals were sent to
the Finance Ministry with an aim to increase APY subscriber base. ‚ÄúCurrently,
we have five slabs of pension from Rs 1,000-5000 per month. There have been a
lot of feedback from the market asking for higher pension amounts because many
people feel that Rs 5,000 at the age of 60 years, 20-30 years from now, will
not be sufficient. We have placed this proposal with the government that it
should be increased to up to Rs 10,000,‚Äù Contractor was quoted as saying.

There are 1.02 crore subscribers of APY at present.

**Nirav Modi used revoked passport four times to travel: Interpol**

Updated: June 14, 2018 8:38:58 am

PNB Fraud Case: Earlier this week, the CBI moved Interpol to issue Red Corner
Notices against Nirav and Choksi.

The Interpol has informed Indian investigation agencies that absconding
diamond jeweller Nirav Modi travelled four times between three countries as
recently as March on an Indian passport that was revoked by the Ministry of
External Affairs (MEA) on February 24, sources have told The Indian Express.

In a June 5 letter to Indian agencies, Interpol said Nirav travelled between
United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong on his Indian passport between
March 15 and March 31. According to Interpol, he travelled four times on that
passport ‚Äî on March 15, March 28, March 30 and March 31.

On February 24, the MEA revoked the passports of Nirav and his maternal uncle
Mehul Choksi, promoter of Gitanjali Group, after they failed to respond to a
February 16 notice issued by the Ministry, asking them to show-cause why their
passports should not be impounded or revoked. **READ | How to bring back a

This was after they came under the scanner of multiple investigation agencies
following state-owned Punjab National Bank‚Äôs complaint against their
companies, saying it had been cheated of an estimated Rs 13,500 crore through
fraudulent issue of letters of undertaking (LoUs) and foreign letters of
credit (FLCs).

The passport revocation order can be challenged in Indian courts. But it is
not known if Nirav and Choksi have done that.

According to norms, once a revocation order is issued by the government, it
has to be communicated to the authority concerned at an airport or any other
point of embarkation or immigration, and to the passport authority.

Emails to the official spokesperson of MEA did not elicit any response.

The Interpol letter to Indian authorities is in response to a diffusion notice
issued by CBI, requesting the Interpol to track Nirav after it registered a
case of alleged fraud against him in January.

**READ | Nirav Modi‚Äôs five dummy firms in Hong Kong whose owners earned Rs 8,000 got Rs 8,000 crore LoUs**

Nirav, his wife Ami (a US citizen), brother Neeshal (a Belgian national) and
uncle Choksi fled the country in the first week of January, weeks before the
scam broke. While Nirav is in the UK, Choksi is learnt to be in the US.
According to sources, Nirav also applied for a permanent residency permit in
Singapore in mid-January.

Earlier this week, the CBI moved Interpol to issue Red Corner Notices against
Nirav and Choksi. Nirav‚Äôs presence in the UK was confirmed by members of the
British delegation led by Minister of State for Countering Extremism, Baroness
Williams, who held deliberations with MoS (Home) Kiren Rijiju in New Delhi on
June 11.

**Opinion: The Kejriwal Protest And Why We Should Back It** 

 ______ 
That the elected Chief Minister of the National Capital territory of Delhi,
Arvind Kejriwal, should be forced to take the unusual step of staging a sit-in

_dharna_

inside the office of Lt. Governor Anil Baijal, has not moved the central
government to intervene and ensure that the LG opens a reasonable dialogue to
redress the legitimate issues raised by the Chief Minister. The LG has refused
to discuss the issues, leave alone give an assurance of resolution. The LG
functions as the representative of the central government and presumably his
adamant and arrogant approach to the elected Chief Minister of Delhi reflects
that of the regime he represents.

The immediate issue is the refusal of officers of the Delhi Government to
fulfil their duties and cooperate with the elected AAP government. The
spokesperson of the IAS Officers Association, Manisha Srivastava, who even
while claiming that officers were not on strike and had in fact prepared the
budget papers and answers to questions in the Assembly, admitted that ""the
officers are not attending routine meetings called by the ministers and the
Chief Minister."" In other words, they are refusing to fulfil their duties.

The animosity of the IAS officers to the AAP government in this instance is
attributed to the dispute with Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash who accused two
AAP MLAs of manhandling him in the Chief Minister's presence at his residence
in February this year. The Chief Minister and the AAP MLAs disputed the
charge. Matters escalated. There could have been better ways to tackle it by
the AAP leadership, which is why they did not get much public support at the
time. But as it was, the Delhi police, which works directly under the LG,
filed an FIR, the accused MLAs were arrested and were in jail for two weeks
before they got bail. The Chief Minister and his deputy were cross-examined by
the police for several hours in the case. This itself is unprecedented. In any
case, the matter is now before the court. But in spite of this, if the entire
group of officers defy the state government, it is because they have the
patronage of the LG and the central government.

Ever since the sweeping victory of AAP in Delhi, the central government has
done everything to sabotage the work of the AAP government using the office of
the LG under the earlier incumbent, and now, more directly and aggressively
under the present LG. Barely a few months after the state assembly elections,
the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a notification in May 2015 that
appropriated for the central government rights of the Delhi Government to
transfer or post personnel in the services and also took away control of the
Anti-Corruption Bureau. The then LG strongly enforced this directive,
cancelling appointments and selecting personnel suited to the interests of the
central government. This undeclared war on even the limited autonomy of the
state government under the present set-up also sent a strong message to
bureaucrats working in the capital to recognize who their boss is.

Unfortunately, the blatant encroachment on the rights of the state government
was legitimised by the surprisingly one-sided judgement of the Delhi High
Court in August 2016 on the petition filed by the state government. It upheld
the LG as the ""administrative"" head of Delhi and completely devalued the
status of an elected government, calling its acts ""unconstitutional and
illegal."" The matter then went to the constitutional bench of the Supreme
Court which completed its hearings in December 2017 but reserved its
judgement. This is the present ""legal"" position.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and three Delhi ministers have been on _dharna_
at Lt Governor's house since Monday

It is in this context that the demand for legislation to grant full statehood
to Delhi has an immediate relevance. The demand is not new. But what is new is
the extent of the hypocrisy being displayed by the BJP.

The attitude of the BJP to a particular issue before its government is not on
the merits of the issue but based on a calculation of whether it will help its
partisan interest and if not, the merit be damned. The demand for statehood
for Delhi has long been a demand of the BJP. But now that it is the AAP in
power, the calculation is that it will help the AAP government, so it has no
hesitation in doing a complete u-turn on the issue.

One of the main promises made by the BJP in the Lok Sabha campaign in 2014 was
that if voted to power, Delhi would get full statehood. After the victory and
the BJP's sweep of all seven seats in Delhi, the then head of the BJP Delhi
unit, Harsh Vardhan, had said ""the first issue we will take up with Narendra
Modi-

_ji_

as PM will be to grant full statehood to Delhi."" Four years later, the present
BJP Delhi unit chief, Manoj Tewari

says

""the present federal structure is flexible enough to cater to the
developmental needs of the city.""

It was under the Vajpayee government that a bill for statehood for Delhi was
moved in parliament by his deputy and the country's Home Minister, LK Advani,
in 2003. It lapsed under the UPA government. However, when the AAP government
moved a somewhat similar bill in the state assembly, the BJP strongly opposed
it.

The BJP has been helped by the Congress party unit in Delhi which seems to
have lost a sense of balance in its all-out campaign and criticism of the AAP
government without uttering a single word against the Modi government's
authoritarian actions and mockery of cooperative federalism. This only reminds
people of the similarity in the basic policies of the BJP and Congress which
at the present juncture amounts to a series of self-goals by the Congress in
Delhi.

The people of Delhi have suffered because of the multiplicity of authorities,
their concerns and rights being kicked around like a football between the
centre and the state government. There is no accountability to the people of
Delhi by either. Each blames the other for reneging on promises. Yet,
accountability to the people is surely the core of good governance. But this
set-up with a bureaucrat selected by the central government as its
""administrative head"" is like a colonial regime where the Viceroy has all the
powers but is answerable only to the monarch.

Unfortunately, the strategy of AAP in its current agitation is rather narrow
in that it has pitched the issue as a party-based one rather than involving a
much wider section of citizens of the capital in the battle to win more rights
for Delhi as a full-fledged state. Nevertheless, the democratic demand for
statehood for Delhi, long advocated by the Left, should be supported; equally,
the dictatorial actions of the central government and its administrative
representative must be opposed. The issue is relevant and urgent not just for
residents of Delhi but for all those who believe in the federal structure of
our country as envisaged and mandated by the constitution.

Modi-

_ji_

has maintained a deafening silence through all this. More than individual
fitness videos for which he has time, the tag for the Prime Minister is

_""Democracy fit toh India fit""_

, but he is spectacularly failing this challenge.

And at the epicenter of the country‚Äôs violent upheaval is the indolent cow. **Emboldened by an ascendant Hindu nationalist movement, coupled with a controversial government ban on cattle slaughter, so-called cow-vigilante groups have been carrying out a ruthless form of mob justice, summarily executing those suspected of killing, trading, or consuming beef.

**Chandrababu Naidu an alternative and threat to Modi: TDP MP** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: TDP MP Jay Galla on Thursday said party chief N Chandrababu Naidu
was ""an alternative and a threat"" to Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

, days after the

Andhra Pradesh

chief minister ruled himself out of the 2019 prime ministerial race.

Galla also said that Modi and BJP President Amit Shah did not want to help
Andhra Pradesh as they believed that any development work in the state would
strengthen Naidu's credibility.

""The current leadership at the Centre doesn't want to share credit with
anybody...As long as Modi and Shah are at the helm, I don't think they're
going to help Andhra Pradesh,"" Galla told reporters here.

""Chandrababu Naidu is one of the senior most politicians in the country. And
if he continues to perform miracles in Andhra Pradesh like he has done in the
past, people would be looking at him as a possible leader. If you look at the
entire idea of a Third Front...one of the things is who's going to lead it?
Any day, he is a threat to Narendra Modi...When people talk about Modi's
alternative, he (Naidu) is definitely in that list,"" Galla said.

Naidu had recently said that the

Telugu Desam Party

(TDP) would play a pivotal role in 2019 when regional parties band together to
form government at the Centre but had ruled himself out of the prime
ministerial race.

The TDP had in March pulled out of the NDA government over the Centre's
refusal to grant special status to the state.

""I do not have any prime ministerial ambitions. This post was offered to me
twice in the past,"" he said, referring to 1996 when H D Deve Gowda became
prime minister and 1997 when I K Gujral took the chair.

""I just want to develop Andhra,"" he had said.

**""Excuse To Not Work"": Sheila Dikshit Trashes Arvind Kejriwal's Protest** 

 ______ 
Sheila Dikshit said that Arvind Kejriwal's dharna was ""completely
unacceptable"".

**New Delhi: **

Even as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Co. continue to couch-surf at
the Lieutenant Governor's home for the

fifth day

, senior Congress leader Sheila Dikshit has trashed the Aam Aadmi Party
leaders' protest as an ""excuse to not work"". At a press meet in the national
capital today, she said Mr Kejriwal was not at all conscious of his
constitutional duties and people are suffering because of his ""confrontational
politics"".

Ms Dikshit, who thrice ruled Delhi before AAP came to power in 2013, said it
was ""completely unacceptable"" that the head of the government was sitting on a
""

_dharna_

"" at the Lt Governor's house when the city was enveloped in a thick blanket of
haze and dust.

""First of all, I don't understand what's their fight is about. What is he
fighting for? What's the aim?"" asked Ms Dikshit.

The Congress veteran said people of Delhi had given Mr Kejriwal a ""huge""
majority and they know ""what's happening"". He does not have any option of
staying away from his responsibilities, she said.

""What message you are giving? It (

_dharna_

) makes no sense. People of Delhi are very disappointed because they brought
him with a huge majority and this is how he is treating them?"" asked Ms
Dikshit.

Four ambulances reached Lt Governor Anil Baijal's home this afternoon where
Arvind Kejriwal is protesting.

Four ambulances reached Delhi

Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal's home

this afternoon amid speculation that Mr Kejriwal and his three ministers -
Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain and Gopal Rai -- would be forcibly removed from
the guest room where they have parked themselves demanding directions to the

IAS officers to end their ""strike""

.

Referring to the administrative structure and Mr Kejriwal's demand for full
statehood for Delhi, Sheila Dikshit said he has to accept the fact that Delhi
is a union territory and there are going to be limitations for any chief
minister, but the disagreements between the Lt Governor and the chief minister
can be sorted out with discussions.

""The roles of the Lt Governor and the chief minister are well defined. You
can't suddenly change their roles. Both of them are free to disagree, but a
dharna at LG's house is no solution. The photographs that have come out of
their sit-in protest are disgraceful,"" she said.

She added when the Congress was in power in Delhi, they, too, had made the
full statehood demand, but they also realised that it wasn't possible.

""Delhi is the national capital. The centre wasn't ready to give charge of land
and police to the Delhi government, because for that the constitution had to
be changed. We understood that and didn't politicise it or use it as an excuse
to not work,"" she said.

The bureaucrats in Delhi government have been on a symbolic strike since an
alleged assault on Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash at the chief minister's
official home in February. The officers have demanded an apology from Mr
Kejriwal and have boycotted meetings with AAP ministers.

Ms Dikshit criticised the AAP chief for his frequent run-ins with the centre
as well as the bureaucrats and said, ""These bureaucrats are not political. The
system was exactly the same during Congress's rule but we never fought with
them. There was never any conflict.""

__ Comments

Since coming to power following a sensational victory in 2015 winning 67 out
of 70 assembly seats, Mr Kejriwal has been at loggerheads with the centre over
a host of issues. He often targets Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to
stall governance in Delhi.

Sheila Dikshit clarified that during her tenure when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was
the Prime Minister, she did not have any problems with the BJP at the centre.
""The Delhi Metro project and CNG buses on Delhi roads and other development
projects were made possible as both the governments worked together. If there
is a conflict, you should try and bring everyone together. Now there is
conflict and nothing else,"" she said.

**Madhya Pradesh: 24 trucks ferrying sand set on fire after farmer's death** 

 ______ 
BHOPAL: 24 trucks were set on fire by an angry mob after a 28-year-old farmer
was run over by a dumper ferrying sand from

Narmada river

basin in Madhya Pradesh's

Hoshangabad district

. Police have found a charred body from the spot, which they claim, was of a
youth from the same village where arson took place. Additional force has been
deployed in the area.

Congress has attacked BJP government on the issue. Congress state president
Kamalnath told a section of that illegal sand mining was rampant in the entire
state. ‚ÄúJahan nadi, wahan Khanan, jahan Khanan waha BJP k neta‚Äù (If there is a
river, there is mining, and if there is mining there must be BJP leader),
Kamanath said.

Krishna Kumar Yadav was pillion riding his uncle Dev Narayan Yadav on a
motorcycle, on their way home, when a speeding dumper, laden with sand, hit
them from behind near Gujjarwada village under Babai police station area.

The incident took place at around 11.30pm and the spot is located around 35 km
from the district headquarters, said police.

Krishna Kumar got under the wheels and died on the spot, while Dev Narayan, a
former sarpanch of Gujjarwada village, sustained major injuries, said police.

Infuriated over the accident, locals set fire to that dumper and 23 other
trucks that were ferrying sand on that route. All drivers managed to escape.
Around 18 trucks were loaded with sand, while six were heading towards the
mining spot.

SHO of Babai police station, his team and fire brigade were also targeted by
villagers pelting stones. One of the police vehicle was also set on fire.
‚ÄúThose indulging in arson and vandalism are being identified, Hosshangabad SP
Arvind Saxena told TOI.

‚ÄúWe have rescued around 175 trucks in our over night operation. Villagers have
torched 24 trucks, 18 partially,‚Äù said the officer. A charred body found from
the spot has been identified as Ramesh Yadav, of Gujjarwada village. ‚ÄúEither
he was part of the mob or must have been passing by when the trucks were set
on fire. He had a skull injury which could be due to the burst of burning
tyres,‚Äù said the officer. There are two sand mines in the area one is at
Gujjarwada and other one at Rajon. ‚ÄúTrucks set on fire were ferrying sand from
the Rajon mines. Most of the trucks were from Indore and Ujjain,‚Äù SP said.
Riot control vehicle was also pressed into service to in wake of the
situation. Additional police force has been deployed in the area in wake of
the boiling situation.

In October 2017, Madhya Pradesh government had allowed sand mining rivers
across the state after four months ban hoping to provide sand at cheap rates
than open market and rein in the mining mafia.

The government had also decided to hand over sand mining rights to the gram
panchayats, it was also stated that decision on the royalty would be taken by
the panchayat itself which includes rights to engage transporters and
labourers to extract sand from their own resources. A detailed feasibility
report from the expert committee is awaited, said the officials.

In February 2017 Congress leader Arun Yadav had written to the prime minister
Narendra Modi, urging him for a probe into alleged involvement of chief
minister‚Äôs relatives in illegal sand mining.

Yadav wrote, illegal sand mining was rampant in entire state because of
political protection and incidents like murder of an IPS officer and attacks
on government officials were common and that majority of illegal sand mining
was being carried out in home district of CM.

He had also alleged that more than 1000 dumpers full of illegal sand were
being mined and transported in the area. And, those involvement have gone to
the extent of building a temporary bridge on Narmada at the Joshipur-Jarrapur
border of Sehore for the illegal transportation.

**A tiny advertisement may be India's declaration of independence** 

 ______ 
**By Mihir Sharma**

It was the most carefully examined little square of newsprint in recent Indian
history. Last week, a small job ad appeared on the inside pages of some
newspapers looking for candidates for the post of ""joint secretary"" in the
Indian government. Within a few hours, the ad had gone viral: Opposition
politicians had weighed in, Twitter was agog and hundreds of thousands of
40ish Indians wondered if they had one last, unexpected opportunity to make
their parents proud.

Anyone unfamiliar with the Indian state would have been mystified by the
uproar. After all, just 10 positions were being advertised, and successful
applicants would get a three-year contract -- at government salaries. What was
the big deal?

Indians, on the other hand, immediately recognized that in opening up the
ranks of the civil service to qualified outsiders, one of their country's
stoutest walls had been breached. India has the most closed and hierarchical
government of any major democracy. In fact, India's bureaucracy is more
removed from its people than those in many authoritarian countries. Our
politicians may get all the attention, but everyone knows that mid-level
bureaucrats such as joint secretaries -- there are about 350 of them in all --
are India's real policy-makers.

A tiny cadre of generalists, known as the Indian Administrative Service,
currently monopolizes these posts. Members of the

IAS

are selected in their 20s, after a fiendishly difficult entrance examination.
In 2016, 1.1 million people sat for the first stage of the selection process;
all knew that only 180 of them would make it into the service. Success is
about as likely as a tossed nickel landing on its edge. You have better odds
of becoming an astronaut if you apply to NASA. Ten times better, in fact.

But, if you make it through the exam, you are guaranteed to be one of India's
rulers for life. Constitutionally, you can't be fired without a time-consuming
and troublesome legal process. At most, elected politicians can transfer you
from one post to another.

Before your 30th birthday, you‚Äôll be given an Indian district to run,
answerable to no local politician or council, and with near-absolute power
over millions of people. You‚Äôll collect their taxes, sit in judgment over
their land disputes, control the local police and disburse pensions and
scholarships and welfare. You‚Äôll travel everywhere with a retinue of junior
officials and favor-seekers, live in the nicest house in the district and be
the guest of honor at every social function. Unsurprisingly, after awhile it
can become quite hard to remember that you are, after all, just another public
servant. In fact, you might begin to suspect you are a superior breed of
human.

Thus, when you‚Äôre called to New Delhi and made a joint secretary in, say, the
shipping ministry, you‚Äôre confident that you will be able to devise complex
new rules for berthing super-tankers in Indian ports on your second day at
work. Of course, given that transfers and postings are almost random, next
year you might be deciding on a trade agreement in the Ministry of Commerce.
Or perhaps predicting the course of the monsoon at the Ministry of Earth
Sciences. Naturally, you know you will do so correctly. Your degree might have
been in 13th-century poetry or something, but training and expertise are for
lesser mortals. You passed a very difficult examination 30 years ago and are
thus fully qualified to rule one-fifth of humanity.

This unaccountable, walled-off governance structure helps answer a question
that outsiders often ask: If India's state is served by such intelligent and
confident officers, why is it so lazy, incompetent and backward-looking?
Policy is ill-conceived, rules are detached from economic reality, laws are
poorly drafted and regulations gush forth from government offices to drown
India‚Äôs billion-plus citizens in paperwork.

And this is why many of us see that little newspaper advertisement as not just
another job posting, but the first draft of a declaration of independence. We
can begin to believe that, one day, positions in New Delhi's corridors of
power -- positions with real responsibility -- will be given to people with
demonstrated ability in the fields they are supposed to supervise.

I'm not declaring independence just yet. There are many reasons to be wary.
The opposition is justly suspicious that the government of Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

wants to stock the bureaucracy with individuals sympathetic to his party's
Hindu nationalist ideology. Others worry that a revolving door between
government and the private sector is being installed, which will lead to
greater corporate power over the state. Marginalized groups wonder if India's
affirmative-action policies are going to be ignored.

I myself worry that many of these positions will not be filled by world-class
experts but by, for example, officers from India's inefficient public sector.
Even so, those of us who have long despaired of India reforming its byzantine
administration can perhaps be permitted a smidgen of hope.

290,"I like the AAP. They have undoubtedly done well for education and healthcare in Delhi. They can surely be competent when they want to... But, this makes no sense to me! Never had I imagined that even governments could go on strike! This is beyond ridiculous.  


Sure, the L-Gs in Delhi have been stalling a lot of work and creating obstacles, and the BJP deserves a lot of flak for that. But, I guess they just have to accept that there are always going to be limitations like that in politics and try to do their best within those limitations. I am sure many many elected representatives all over the world have faced an uncooperative bureaucracy or a federal government trying to meddle in its affairs. They all just work within those confines. Kejriwal instead seems to be hell-bent just alienating everyone instead of trying work alongside other people. He can't seem to be able to work with anyone - from Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, to two different L-Gd, to the entire bureaucracy! (And what's with this asking Modi to solve his problems with the bureaucracy for him?? He is the CM, why does he need others to sort people who work under him?!) If the current ministers are so incapable of cooperating with the people they have to work with on a daily basis, they should just resign and let others in the AAP with better people skills run the administration instead of wasting everyone's time like this and making accusation left, right, and center.  


I want to like the AAP. They have done some really good work in the fields that matter most. But this just seems like pure incompetence to me. Can someone affiliated or associated with the party put this into any perspective for me. I can't really see how the way they are acting can be justified.",2018-06-15 19:24:48
291,"I would advise anyone who doesn‚Äôt want a sugarcoated and excessively wishful thinking answer to turn away unless you want a pretty biting answer.

Unlikely.

The people who claim that India will soon become the next China in terms of growth tend to have a misunderstanding of this figure[1]:


The usual claim is ‚ÄúChina had a demographic dividend, so its our turn now‚Äù, this is frankly speaking quite naive.

India has a number of embedded structural deficiencies, including a massively underdeveloped industrial basis, high growth rates leading to high NPA‚Äôs, an acute lack of the types of capital required for high growth rates and an assortment of governmental issues means that its unlikely that India will be able to pull it off.

Couple these facts w/ the ongoing issue of automation, AI and less and less willingness by the developed world to absorb massive amounts of exports means that its unlikely that India will be able to experience a China-type growth miracle.

The rest of my answer will merely be from my other answers here[2]and here[3], which largely applies to India as well.

Increased protectionism

Countries in the developed world don‚Äôt want to absorb the same amount of trade deficits (along with the associated job losses) that allowed China, South Korea, Japan and next coming Vietnam to climb the economic ladder, this means India will have to compete w/ other developing countries in order to gets its exports to the west. As I‚Äôve pointed out, during East Asia‚Äôs rise, the words free trade and globalization

India will have to find a way to compete w/ Vietnam and Indonesia or the Philippines, which is a heck of a lot easier said than done. In fact, both those countries are outperforming India relative to their populations by quite a large margin. So India is not showing much promise as of right now in this field.

Technology

It‚Äôs been noted here before, India‚Äôs non-price competitiveness is very low, non-price competitiveness essentially means the comparative advantage derived not from an undervalued currency or low wages but other factors.

It‚Äôs pretty clear that India frankly is not going to be able to dramatically increase non-price competitiveness anytime soon, which is a bad sign particularly with the new advent of automation.

To see examples of high non-price competitive countries, all we need to do is look at these graphs:



Now, if your country has low non-price competitiveness, that means time is running out as automation comes into play and dramatically reduces the need for low wage labor.

I‚Äôm just going to say it, it‚Äôs incredibly unlikely India will be able to do this based on past projections and current data. Although Modi is trying to push on this front the said structural deficiencies that India‚Äôs economy has is not going to allow much progress in the short-medium term.

The Changing nature of manufacturing

This is from my other answer:

‚ÄúManufacturing is changing, it used to be that businesses had to order in bulk now they can order on a case by case business due to the advent of cheaper internet connectivity. This has led to manufacturing being more and more determined not by cheap labor but by the economies of scale and having the required infrastructure to catch onto this new trend.

What it used to be:

A business needs to buy at least 500 shirts for the spring sale, they need to buy in bulk due to the fear of the supply being short, unfortunately the spring sale doesn‚Äôt go as well as planned and only 350 shirts are sold. 150 shirts are now being sold at a loss or must be stored for a cost for the next season.

What it now is:

A business can now order in units of 25 using the internet and have them shipped based on demand, now the business estimates with a far higher accuracy the amount of shirts that they sell, as a result the business does not have any excess shirts they need to sell at a loss or store at a cost for the next season.

As long as developing countries (w/ the notable exception of China and Vietnam *again) don‚Äôt have the ability to catch onto this trend, there is simply less incentive to migrate manufacturing to them.‚Äù

This new trend in manufacturing is making manufacturing less and less determined just by vast amounts of cheap labor but more and more by economies of scale and non-price competitiveness, both of these factors India sorely lacks and is unlikely to be able to build up before automation comes into play.

Government efficiency

Although India is much better on Pakistan on this regard, it‚Äôs still not something to be proud of. India‚Äôs government is quite inefficient and has a huge problem with corruption. With this in mind it‚Äôs even less likely India will be able to build up the required factors to sustain export-led industrialization.

Conclusion

While India will likely achieve decent growth rates in the short-mid term, it will not be able to sustain the growth rates required for a growth-miracle, largely due to waning export led industrialization, embedded structural deficiencies and the coming advent of automation.

**Modi government to roll out uniform Value Education for schools in 2019-20 session** 

 ______ 
As it enters the election year, the

Modi government

is set to roll out a ‚Äòuniform‚Äô and ‚ÄòCommon Minimum Programme for Value
Education‚Äô for implementation across India‚Äôs entire schooling system, in the
2019-20 academic session.

The uniformity of

Value Education

imparted across schools will be ensured with a firm focus on ‚Äòcore
Constitutional values‚Äô and these have been identified as Justice, Equality,
Fraternity and Liberty.

In a bid to stay non-controversial, Value Education will focus on values
enshrined in the

Constitution

and general concerns on compassion and respect for all persons, sources told
ET.

Students, teachers as well as schools will be assessed on Value Education
through a non-marks based approach.

The National Council of Educational Research &amp;amp; Training (NCERT) will
mainly prepare these modules which , though not mandatory for any school board
to follow, are expected to acquire a pan India effect on their own as a number
of school boards go by

NCERT

textbooks.

Junking the old school approach of a separate dedicated ‚ÄòMoral Science/Value
Education‚Äô class period, the union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry
is working on a Value Education framework that is built into every subject and
syllabi through a Whole School Approach (WSA), ET has learnt.

Value Education will be complemented by modules on Life Skills Education
linked up with government‚Äôs flagship Ayushman Bharat as well as Experiential
Learning.

**Value Addition**

The government‚Äôs ‚Äòroadmap‚Äô on Value Education conceptualises it as a ‚Äúplanned
effort by schools to nurture the core universal values held upmost by our
Constitution‚Äô.

‚ÄúIt would provide the required uniformity across the country and at the same
time would be flexible enough to provide scope for variations for different
types of schools‚Äù, says the roadmap.

The NCERT will develop a Common Minimum Programme by August 2018 which will be
pilot tested in some schools by September this year.

Both- the teacher‚Äôs appraisal and the student‚Äôs report card will factor in
value education and ‚Äòoutcomes‚Äô will be measured through an assessment design
that is ‚Äòspiral and compulsory in nature‚Äô. Schools will further also be
accredited on the basis of implementation of value education from 2019-20
session.

The assessment of a teacher‚Äôs ‚Äòoutcome‚Äô on value education will also be a
criteria for the Teacher‚Äôs awards.

The National Council of Teachers Education (NCTE) will, from July on, train
teachers in value education components to ‚Äúreaffirm their commitment‚Äù to
promoting values amongst students and ‚Äúuphold the core Constitutional values
in their own lives and become effective facilitators to inculcate the same in
their students‚Äù.

Modules are also being prepared to attune school leadership to help build
skills of ‚Äúcaring and pro-value attitudes‚Äù in the school environment.
Community participation involving parents for value inculcation and
partnerships with media houses to spread the message are planned, besides
creating an online platform best practices.

**Life Skills Education**

Life Skills Education or ‚Äòhealth and wellness for school going adolescents‚Äô
will be implemented under the aegis of ‚ÄòAyushman Bharat‚Äô mission and be rolled
out in the 115 Aspirational Districts in the first phase. Two periods in a
block per week are planned on Life skills.

Nine core Life Skills have been identified for the programme‚ÄîSelf-awareness,
problem solving, decision making, critical thinking, creative thinking,
empathy, communication, interpersonal relationship and managing emotions.

Prevention and management of substance abuse, sexual and reproductive health,
prevention of non communicable diseases, safe use of internet and social media
behaviour, gender equality, safety and security against violence and injuries
besides responsible citizenship will be built into the Life Skills programme.

While no grades or marks will be awarded for Life skills in a student‚Äôs report
card, there will be a descriptive narration of the student‚Äôs progress on the
same. The National achievement Survey of NCERT will from 2019 also include
Life skills assessment.

Each school board will be advised to set up a Life Skills Cell which will be
linked to a think tank -Life Skills Centre of Excellence to guide and support
the implementation of life skill education.

Resource material in both English and Hindi is being developed with experts
from the Health and HRD ministries, civil society organisations as well United
Nations agencies and his will be pre tested by teachers by mid-September.

**Experiential Learning  
**

Experiential learning, which is already being rolled out gradually, will aim
at taking the student beyond the confines of a textbook.

Not to be treated as a subject but to be implemented from Class 1 on, the ELP
as a pedagogy will help students learn through direct experiences and some of
the activities cited are role play, group discussions, lab experiments,
projects, internships, visits to farms, factories, post offices, museums,
sports and yoga. An assessment framework for the same will be readied by
September end.

**Digital India initiatives have created 3 lakh jobs, empowered citizens: PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra

Modi

today said the network of about three lakh Common Service Centres, which act
as access points for delivery of digital services, have bolstered employment
and entrepreneurship opportunities, thus empowering citizens.

Interacting with beneficiaries of the various Digital

India

efforts, Modi said the initiative was launched with an objective of bringing
benefits of

technology

to people, especially in rural areas.

Technology has helped book railway tickets and pay bills online, bringing
great convenience, Modi said.

""We ensured that the advantages of technology are not restricted to a select
few but are there for all sections of society. We strengthened the network of
CSCs,"" Modi said.

The initiative is creating a group of village level entrepreneurs, he added.

Addressing the Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs), who run these centres, via
video conferencing, Modi said

Digital India

was launched with an aim to connect India's villages and youth.

Over the last four years it has brought a slew of services to the doorsteps of
the common man, he said.

""Every aspect of digital empowerment has been worked on, from rolling out
fibre optics in villages, to digital literacy,"" Modi said.

Some of the beneficiaries narrated their experience of Digital India.

Jitender Solanki from Gautam Budh Nagar stated that after his village got
internet access, children are availing online coaching.

Also, digital literacy is rising and pension-related issues for elderly are
now getting resolved through technology.

Modi asked the beneficiaries to press traders and shopkeepers to install
'Bhim' app to facilitate paying for goods and services digitally.

**Modi govt wants IITs to tone down their entrance exam for engineers** 

 ______ 
The government wants the Indian Institutes of Technology to bring down the
difficulty levels of the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)-Advanced so that seats
don‚Äôt go vacant, unlike this year when the cut-off had to be reduced after it
appeared that about 1,000 seats may not get filled up.

‚ÄúWe would like to ask

IIT Council

and IITs to examine the modalities and the test design of JEE-Advanced exam
keeping in view the poor outcome this year. We feel this (test design) was far
beyond the capability of students and this issue needs to be addressed,‚Äù R
Subrahmanyam, secretary (higher education), in the Ministry of Human Resource
Development told ET.

The ministry is of the view that the difficulty level of JEEAdvanced may be
too high, as it was in

JEE 2018

. The issue will be taken up as a key agenda item at the next meeting of the
IIT Council, which is chaired by the HRD minister. JEE-Advanced 2018,
organised by IIT-Kanpur, saw a sharp dip in the number of qualifying students
with 18,138 candidates declared eligible for admission to 11,279 IIT seats.

**JAB RELUCTANT TO REDUCE CUT-OFF  
  
**

The IIT system itself assessed at least 1,000 seats could go vacant this year
with such a short

merit list

. This was expected to hit certain categories such as women and STs. The IIT
Joint Admission Board (JAB) had met on June 12 to take stock. Despite the
possibility of seats going vacant, the board was reluctant to bring down cut-
off and deferred any decision, pending detailed data analysis.

But the

HRD ministry

was quick to respond through a letter to the JAB chairman dated June 13. In
this letter, the ministry underlined ‚Äúthe policy of the Government of India
that all the reservation category seats in all disciplines are filled and no
vacant seat is left after counselling for admission in IITs‚Äù.

The communication further asked the JAB chairman ‚Äúto ensure‚Äù that a list of
candidates twice the number of seats in each discipline and category be
released, strictly as per merit, prior to counselling.

This prompted a second JAB meeting the same day that led to the decision to
bring down the cut-off by 10%, which would add 13,000 candidates to the merit
list. This is not the first time questions have been raised about the nature
of the JEE and the need for reform.

The intent then was to assess ‚Äòraw intelligence‚Äô and disincentivise coaching
centres. A single-exam format was proposed under the National Democratic
Alliance government to ease the pressure on students, but it could not take
off.

**Opinion: Kejriwal (Still) Being Punished For Defeating Modi - By Yashwant Sinha** 

 ______ 
An unprecedented crisis has overtaken the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
And it is not merely the sheet of dust. This will vanish when the rains come,
but the other crisis will not go away that easily.

The Chief Minister of Delhi, along with his three senior-most cabinet
colleagues, is sitting on

_dharna_

at the Lieutenant Governor's office for the last six days and an end to this
crisis is not in sight.

The Aam Aadmi Party was elected to power by the people of Delhi with an
unprecedented mandate. It secured 67 of 70 seats in the assembly in the
elections held in 2015. The problems relating to governance started soon
thereafter. Not that it was the first time when two different political
dispensations were in power in the National Capital Territory in Delhi and in
the Government of India. Yet, there was the spirit of democratic accommodation
on both sides which prevented it from spilling over into the open.

The governance of the NCT of Delhi is entrusted to a diarchy, the elected
government and the government of India-appointed LG. Yet, the powers are very
clearly defined. The constitution of India provided for only two types of
territory in the country, territories of states and territories of the Union.
While the territories of the states were to be governed by elected state
governments, the territories of the Union were to be governed by an
Administrator. Delhi was granted special status by inserting Article 239AA in
part VIII of the constitution through the 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of
1991. With the insertion of this Article specific to Delhi, Article 239 ceased
to apply to the state of Delhi. Article 239AA specifically provides for a
legislative assembly, bestows it with legislative powers and enjoins upon the
Lieutenant Governor to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

Entries 1, 2 and 18 were kept out of the preview of the Delhi Assembly which
relate to public order, police and land. There is a separate provision for
resolving difference of opinion between the LG and the minister in charge of a
department, according to which the matter would be first referred to the
council of ministers and, if the difference still persists, to the President
of India.

The Aam Aadmi Party was elected to power by the people of Delhi with an
unprecedented mandate.

The constitutional arrangement, envisaged by the amendment of 1991, was
illegally and fundamentally altered by the Government of India by its
notification dated May 21, 2015, soon after the AAP government assumed office.
The centre took complete control of ""Services"" in the NCT of Delhi on spurious
grounds by placing it in the same category as public order, police and land.
The elected AAP government thus lost all control over all ""Services"" within
its jurisdiction, including class IV services. So, if a minister asks a peon
to carry a file from one room to another and the peon refuses to do so, there
is nothing a minister can do to discipline him. This notification has reduced
the elected government of Delhi to a joke.

The Delhi government took the matter to court. It lost its case in the Delhi
High Court and appealed to the Supreme Court. The final hearing of the case in
the Supreme Court concluded on December 6, 2017. Orders are still awaited,
though according to its own direction, the Supreme Court must deliver its
order within three months of the conclusion of the hearing.

What happened to the Chief Secretary of Delhi at the midnight meeting at the
residence of the Chief Minister was most unfortunate. Spats between civil
servants and politicians are not unknown and the issue should have been
resolved immediately, instead of allowing it to fester for five months. Now it
has assumed the dimension of a full-scale trade union type agitation by civil
servants which has created the present untenable situation. A criminal case
has been filed and it is under investigation by the Delhi police. Should we
not wait for its outcome?

Diarchy is a flawed system of governance, yet it had worked reasonably
satisfactorily until the advent of the Aam Aadmi Party government led by
Arvind Kejriwal. The reason for this is not far to seek. The BJP was
comprehensively defeated during the assembly elections. It could win only
threw seats in a house of 70. Prime Minister Modi was the face of the party in
this election. Thus, the message of the Delhi election was that Prime Minister
Modi had lost the election to Kejriwal in the National Capital Territory of
India. An Atal Bihari Vajpayee would have taken it more maturely and shown
statesmanship as indeed he did when the Congress party won the election in
Delhi in 1998.

Diarchy is a flawed system of governance, yet it had worked reasonably
satisfactorily until the advent of the Aam Aadmi Party government led by
Arvind Kejriwal.

On the other hand, the present government of India retaliated by issuing the
notification of May 21, 2015, which maimed and disabled the Delhi government
of the Aam Aadmi Party completely. The option available to it was either to
continue enjoying the perks of office, but not its powers, or go down
fighting. They have chosen to fight.

The immediate issue can and should be resolved by the government of India
immediately. The Home Minister should call a meeting of the LG, the Chief
Minister and the Chief Secretary of Delhi and resolve the issue of the non-
cooperation by the bureaucracy with the elected government of Delhi without
any further loss of time. In fact, he should have done it day before
yesterday. Statesmanship also demands that the notification of May 21, 2015,
should be withdrawn without waiting for the verdict of the Supreme Court. No
government can work effectively with tools over which it has no control.

But what is the long-term solution? The first is full statehood for Delhi
which has been consistently expounded by the BJP and the Congress party. But
there are some Doubting Thomases who think that the governance of the national
capital should remain with the central government at least partially. This is
the reason why, when Delhi was given special status with its own legislature,
public order, police and land were kept outside its purview and vested in the
Lieutenant Governor. This arrangement has now failed. A compromise formula
therefore would be for the central government to retain full control over the
area within the jurisdiction of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation and
administer it directly as a Union Territory with its own Administrator. The
rest of the National Capital Territory should be constituted into a full-
fledged state of Delhi with all the powers of a state government. We have the
Chandigarh model to go by. New York hosts the United Nations, which is like a
world government, yet the entire administration of New York including the
police is with the mayor of New York.

Institutions are what people make of them. When the people fail, it is the
strength of the institution which must sustain it.

Kejriwal is paying the price for having defeated Modi in February 2015.

**Does loving Hindus mean hating Muslims? Asks Mamata** 

 ______ 
KOLKATA:

West Bengal

chief minister

Mamata Banerjee

today said those who accuse her of appeasing Muslims are friends of neither
the Hindus nor the Muslims.

""Some accuse me of (doing) Muslim appeasement. My question to them is whether
loving Hindus means you have to hate Muslims. I respect and love all
communities and religion. This country belongs to everybody,"" she said.

""Those who say I appease Muslims are friends of neither the Hindus nor the
Muslims,"" Banerjee, also the Trinamool Congress supremo, said while addressing
a special prayer gathering on Red Road here to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr.

The BJP and some other organisations have been charging Banerjee with
appeasement of Muslims for political reasons.

The chief minister said it was due to her protest that the Niti Aayog meeting
which was earlier scheduled for today was changed to tomorrow.

""My question to the Central government officials is whether they are not aware
that Eid is scheduled to be celebrated on June 16. Why the Niti Aayog meeting
was kept on that day? I had written to the Central government urging it to
change the date so that it doesn't clash with Eid,"" she said.

Banerjee had yesterday confirmed her participation in the Niti Aayog's
rescheduled governing council meeting in New Delhi on June 17.

The meeting, which will be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was
earlier scheduled on June 16, the day when Eid-ul-Fitr is to be celebrated.

Banerjee and a few other chief ministers had expressed unwillingness to attend
the meeting in view of the Eid festival, following which it was postponed by a
day to June 17.

order, said, ‚ÄúThe cadre controlling authorities of Central government
ministries, departments and Union territories are to carry out promotions in
accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.‚Äù Every promotion order
must clearly mention the stipulation that the promotion shall be subject to
further orders which may be passed by the Supreme Court, it said. According to
the order, besides the Central government departments concerned, state
governments are also advised to take necessary action in this matter.

The personnel ministry order will be applicable to SC and ST category
employees working with the Centre and the state governments, an officer said.
The apex court had on June 5 allowed the Centre to go ahead with reservation
in promotion for employees belonging to the SC and ST category in ‚Äúaccordance
with law‚Äù.

The top court took into account the Centre‚Äôs submissions that entire process
of promotion has come to a ‚Äústandstill‚Äù due to the orders passed by various
high courts and the apex court had also ordered for ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù in a similar
matter in 2015. ‚ÄúWe will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in
accordance with law,‚Äù a vacation bench comprising Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel
and Ashok Bhushan had told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh,
representing the Centre.

During the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in
promotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court‚Äôs 2006 judgement
in M Nagaraj case would be applicable. The M Nagaraj verdict had said that
creamy layer concept cannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992
Indra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal
Commission verdict) and 2005 E V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh,
which dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category.

On November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to
consider whether its 11-year-old judgement in M Nagaraj case was needed to be
re-visited. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney
case in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to
continue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.

319,"&gt; And you are comparing that to Kejriwal working under Modi and Shah?

Pondicherry is also a UT currently governed by Congress. They are also having similar problems with the LG there. But aren't the handling it with more political maturity? Whenever the LG there overeaches, the Congress highlights that fact to the public. But it doesn't degrade the LG with cheap politics because the office of the LG is also a constitutional post under our federal system of governance.

They still focus on development. And they are successful because they understand that good relation with the beureaucracy is more important than trying to show up-manship over the LG. Ultimately it is the bureaucracy that executes all the orders of the LG and the CM, and so it is they who decide whethe the LG's pleasure and displeasure should show in their work.

Did you know that when Shiela Dixit was the CM of Delhi, and UPA took over, she didn't replace any of the NDA appointed high-ranking secrataries? By not doing so, she earned the respect of the Delhi bureaucracy and thus was able to successfully execute the Delhi Metro projects, reduce government expenditure, increase pass percentage etc (i.e. successfully execute various development projects).

&gt; Did Sheila Dixit had to go through this?

Shiela Dixit, being a Congress politician, had the benefit of the Congress party's political maturity to work within the bounds of the Constitution that defines the ""cooperative federalism"" nature of the UT.

Give me one example to show where the inexperienced AAP government has treated the office of the LG with respect or even genuinely cooperated with them?

And besides, both Congress and BJP have argued for Delhi's statehood themselves. Its not a new issue.

You are seeing Kejriwals hysterics, but the LG's hysterics (and subsequently hysterics of Modi/Shah) are far more controlled, they are not reacting in any way and carrying own their dirty tactics. Its the same thing with their strategy of slowly creeping Hindutva everywhere.

**'PM Modi neither talks to me nor looks at me nor allows me to talk'** 

 ______ 
**How long do you plan to continue the protest?

  
  
**

‚Ä¢ The strike by IAS officers has stalled many important works concerning the
people of Delhi. The IAS officers do not attend any meeting convened by
ministers, they do not respond to phone calls of ministers, nor do they go on
any field visits with ministers. It is extremely strange that soon after our
government was formed in Delhi, the Modi government snatched all our powers
concerning the transfers and postings of officers. Today the elected Delhi
government cannot take any action on officers. The officers‚Äô strike has been
instigated by the central government to paralyse the Delhi government.

**What if the LG does not respond to your demands?**

‚Ä¢ We need to understand why this officers‚Äô strike was instigated. Despite
being faced with numerous hurdles created by the Centre, the AAP government
has performed wonderfully. So people are asking if the AAP government did not
allow private schools to hike their fees, and made tests and medicines
available for free in government hospitals, what did the BJP governments in
Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh do in so many years? If electricity
tariffs in Delhi are the lowest in the country, why PM Modi couldn‚Äôt do so in
the country in the last four years? So they devised this way to paralyse our
government. But I want to assure the people of Delhi that I will tirelessly
keep working for their welfare and their rights till my last breath. Until
they end the IAS officers‚Äô strike, we will not step back.

**You have said that work has been affected because officers are not attending meetings. Can you share which are the key areas that have been hit?**

‚Ä¢ On Friday, environment minister Imran Hussain had convened a meeting on
tackling air pollution. The environment secretary and member secretary did not
turn up. Officers have not attended meetings on desilting of drains, tackling
dengue and chikungunya, whitewashing of schools, setting up mohalla clinics,
work on Signature Bridge, etc.

**You and three other ministers are camping at LG‚Äôs office. How is that impacting governance?  
**

‚Ä¢ I have already said that the officers‚Äô strike has been instigated to
paralyse our government.

**Your appeals to PM Narendra Modi have not been answered till now. Do you plan to end the stir and attend the NITI Aayog meeting on Sunday to seek his intervention?**

‚Ä¢ I have written to the PM and appealed to him that before the meeting, the
strike should be called off. It will end within a minute if the PM wants. I
have attended many meetings in which the PM is present, but he neither talks
to me nor looks at me. In these meetings, the representative of Delhi is not
given an opportunity to speak.

**After a long time, you have stepped up the attack on PM.  
**

‚Ä¢ I am appealing to him with folded hands that he should intervene and put an
end to the strike due to which Delhi has got a bad name across the world. The
world is seeing that the officers are not working, and an elected chief
minister and his ministers are sitting for six days to get a strike ended.
Delhi government‚Äôs work is being lauded the world over and in September former
UN secretary general Kofi Annan along with several other international
dignitaries will visit India to see the mohalla clinics.

**You say the AAP government has performed better than BJP governments in other states. How did that happen if IAS officers were not supporting you?  
**

‚Ä¢ Despite all obstacles in our way, it is our will power and honest politics
that has seen our government deliver.

**On February 19, the chief secretary came for a midnight meeting. What happened all of a sudden that all bureaucrats started boycotting the routine meetings with you and other ministers?**

‚Ä¢ There was no attack. It is a ploy to destabilise our government. Since the
matter is now in court, I will appeal to all to wait for the verdict.

**Do you think it is reasonable for a CM to go to meet the LG with an appointment and refuse to leave his office unless his demands are met?**

‚Ä¢ We tried our best to resolve this issue through dialogue. For the last three
months, we did everything possible to reason with the LG. I have myself met
him four times, Manish Sisodia met him four times, Gopal Rai and Satyendar
Jain met him thrice. We also wrote to him. Every time, he said just one thing:
that he wanted a week‚Äôs time to resolve everything. Then we realised that the
Centre wants us to remain a lameduck government. So we decided to fight.

**BJP leaders are on dharna outside your office demanding your return to work.  
**

‚Ä¢ It is beyond any reasonable understanding why they are on dharna. On the one
hand they are saying that the officers are not on strike and doing good work;
on the other, they are saying there is problem with electricity and water.

**A severe water crisis has hit the city when you as water minister are on dharna. What have you done?**

‚Ä¢ I agree there is a water problem in some parts of Delhi. But in the last
three months, whenever I called up the DJB CEO, he did not answer. Barring the
formal board meetings, he refuses to attend any meeting. How do I work?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the fourth meeting of Niti Aayog‚Äôs
Governing Council on Sunday (Twitter/PMO)

Listing out the challenges that lay ahead of India, Prime Minister Narendra
Modi on Sunday discussed measures to double farmers‚Äô income and the progress
of government‚Äôs flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat, National Nutrition
Mission and Mission Indradhanush. Addressing the fourth meeting of Niti
Aayog‚Äôs Governing Council, Modi said that the economy has grown at a healthy
rate of 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 and that the schemes
such as Mudra Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana and Stand Up India have helped in
greater financial inclusion.

The vision of ‚ÄòNew India-2022‚Äô is the ‚Äúresolve of people‚Äù of the country, Modi
said, the gathering of Chief Ministers represents the ‚Äúhopes and aspirations
of the people of India‚Äù and that it is their responsibility to fulfil them.
Citing the implementation of GST as an example, PM Modi said that NITI Aayog
had approached complex issues of governance as ‚ÄúTeam India.‚Äù Adding that 1.5
lakh Health and Wellness Centres are being constructed under the Ayushman
Bharat Scheme, Modi said that about 10 crore families will be provided health
assurance worth Rs. 5 lakhs every year. During the meeting, he also assured
maximum assistance from the Centre to states affected by flash floods.

The council, apex body of Niti Aayog, includes all chief ministers, lieutenant
governors of union territories, several union ministers and senior government
officials (Source: Twitter/ PMO)

Prime Minister Modi also said that the chief ministers of various states had
played a key role in policy formulation, through sub-groups and committees on
issues such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Digital Transactions, and Skill
Development and that their recommendations have been incorporated by various
ministries. Adding that the states are receiving over 11 crore rupees from the
Centre ‚Äî an increase of about 6 lakh crore rupees from the last year of the
previous government ‚Äî Modi said that the government is now targeting universal
coverage in schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Saubhagya, UJALA
program, Jan Dhan Yojana, Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, Suraksha Bima Yojana, and
Mission Indradhanush.

The day-long meeting of the NITI Aayog ‚Äî the government‚Äôs policy think-tank ‚Äî
will review the work done during the previous year and deliberates upon the
development agenda for ‚ÄòNew India 2022‚Äô. The council, apex body of Niti Aayog,
includes all chief ministers, lieutenant governors of union territories,
several union ministers and senior government officials. West Bengal Chief
Minister Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Kerala CM
Pinarayi Vijayan, Karnataka CM H D Kumaraswamy, Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje
and Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Aditya Nath are among the chief ministers attending
the NITI Aayog meet. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been
staging a sit-in protest at LG Baijal‚Äôs office over the bureaucratic impasse
in the city, skipped the meeting.

**India's exports hit six-month high of $28.86 billion in May** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India's

exports

grew 20.18 per cent to $28.86 billion in May -- the highest in six months,
even though the trade deficit widened to a four month high of $14.62 billion.

Imports

too rose by 14.85 per cent to $43.48 billion during the month, according to
the data released by the commerce ministry.

The previous high growth of exports was recorded at 30.55 per cent in November
2017.

Similarly, in January this year, the trade deficit was at $16.28 billion.

Exporting sectors, which helped to push the shipments in May include petroleum
products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and engineering.

However, exports of cashew, iron ore, textiles, gems and jewellery,
handicrafts and carpet registered negative growth.

Gold imports during the month under review dipped by 29.85 per cent to $3.48
billion as against $4.96 billion in the same period last year.

During April-May 2018-19, exports grew by 12.58 per cent to $54.77 billion,
while imports were up by 9.72 per cent to $83.11 billion. Trade deficit
widened to $28.34 billion in the two months of this fiscal as compared to
$27.09 billion during the same period previous fiscal.

Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu said that in May, exports grew by
20.18 per cent.

Also, in 2017-18, exports of goods and services put together rose by 12.78 per
cent, which is highest in about 6-7 years.

""Exports have increased significantly in 2017-18 despite the fact that we are
facing lot of challenges particularly this year,"" the minister told reporters
here.

He said that issues such as delay in GST refund is more or less sorted out and
""2018-19 fiscal should be better than 2017-18"".

Payment of GST will help exporters deal with the issue of working capital, he
added.

Prabhu said the ministry is working with all the concerned ministries to
promote shipments.

""We are working on a strategy to involve all the concerned ministries. They
have decided to fix targets for themselves for export,"" he said, adding that
in

May exports

have increased in volume terms.

When asked about the credit issues being faced by the gems and jewellery
sector after Nirav Modi bank fraud, he said: ""bank finance is one of the
challenges for this sector so we have raised this issue with the finance
ministry. We told (them) that they should take export as a priority sector
lending because that will address many of the issues"".

Oil imports were up 49.46 per cent to $11.5 billion on back of surge in
international crude prices.

Meanwhile, an official statement said that the Department of Commerce will
soon open 10 offices in Indian missions abroad for accelerating export
promotion activities.

This was informed by the minister during review of the sectoral export
promotion plans prepared by ministries and departments here today.

A conference of heads of Indian missions has been scheduled in June end, in
which trade promotion measures will be discussed.

The minister stressed on the branding of Indian products and export credit as
important focus areas for export promotion.

He also suggested that each ministry and department should set targets for
increasing exports of their product and product groups in 2018-2019.

Commerce Minister emphasised that exports are a national priority and an
integrated approach is required to promote exports as a joint mission.

Director General Foreign Trade Alok Chaturvedi informed that the department is
preparing a '100 Billion Additional Export Strategy' which will be released
shortly.

370,"&gt; Why did Congress not build toilets in 70 years? They couldn‚Äôt even do something so basic. This argument sounds logical and I believed it too, until I started reading India‚Äôs history. When we gained independence in 1947 we were an extremely poor country, we didn‚Äôt have the resources for even basic infrastructure and no capital. To counteract this PM Nehru went down the socialist path and created PSU‚Äôs. We had no capacity to build steel, so with the help of Russians the Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC), Ranchi was set up that made machines to make steel in India‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwithout this we would have no steel, and consequently no infrastructure. That was the agenda‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbasic industries and infra. We had frequent droughts (aakaal), every 2‚Äì3 years and a large number of people starved to death. The priority was to feed the people, toilets were a luxury no one cared for. The Green Revolution happened and the food shortages disappeared by the 1990s‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänow we have a surplus problem. The toilet situation is exactly like people asking 25 years from now why Modi couldn‚Äôt make all houses in India air conditioned. That seems like a luxury today, toilets were also a luxury at some point of time. Maybe things could have happened sooner, maybe 10‚Äì15 years ago, but nothing happened in 70 years is a horrible lie to peddle.

That's true introspection right there. Welcome to the opposition brother!",2018-06-17 20:32:51

That was the agenda‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbasic industries and infra.

I live in Bokaro, which is a steel township built in 1964 with the help of Soviet Union. There are others like Durgapur, Bhilai., Rourkela etc which were built on a similar model.

I can tell you that these cities have some of the highest living standards for a small city of this scale. My family has lived in a government provided housing throughout their life. We have free healthcare for all my family including my grandparents, free primary and secondary education in decent schools (although now has a lot of private schools). The city is superbly planned (mind you this was 1960s that we are talking) with sectors where each sector has its own small health centre, a secondary school, and a major hospital in the town centre, all of which is free for the employees and their families. The plant has provided direct employment to millions of people so far, thereby lifting them out of poverty, and of course a lot of indirect employment has resulted from setting up the plant and the city.

The whole project was a brainchild of Nehru under the 1st 5 year plan. Who do you think me, my family and these people should give credit to? (hint: Modi is not an answer) This is merely an anecdote, but the BJP right now has brainwashed the country to believe that absolutely nothing happened in the country for 70 years while their minions go ahead and demonize Nehru in every possible way, while forgetting that much of the self sufficiency that India has achieved so far after independence is a direct result of Nehru's leadership and vision.",2018-06-17 23:51:22
372,"Politics is a long game. It is virtually impossible for a new party to come up from scratch and do everything the nation hopes or dreams will happen with him at the helm. The work AAP has done, specially in education and healthcare, is vastly superior than what most parties do in the first few years of their existence.

He is doing all this with the central government actively disrupting each and every thing AAP are doing in Delhi. The odds are really stacked against him like few leaders, both in politics with the Congress and BJP actively trying to nip his movement in the bud, and with the media.

Let me focus on the mohalla clinics, because that is a clear example of the various forces in play here.

1. AAP sets up the mohalla clinics in Delhi in 2015, radically expanding healthcare access. I cannot overstate how much easier it is to get basic healthcare in Delhi now compared to pre-2015.

2. This project is praised by pretty much everyone from the UN and Kofi Annan to [NITI Aayog](https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-governments-mohalla-clinics-get-rare-praise-from-this-body-set-up-by-narendra-modi/1154680/) (surprising tbh)

3. Budget priorities - nearly 17% of the Delhi govt's budget is on healthcare, which is a welcome change.

4. The interference begins - last year Lieutenant gov. Baijal refused to approve Mohalla clinic plans, this year there's a CBI enquiry. How much of it is justified, I don't know, but AAP definitely gets much harsher treatment and persecution than BJP, Congress or the many leaders who make up the old face of politics.

5. Some mohalla clinics are in a really poor state. Let me be clear that AAP should be held accountable for their promises and they did overreach while making their initial 500 clinics goal.

 But most socialist government projects suffer from lack of maintenance and require good state, central and external (NGO) support to function properly. While the state govt. is partly culpable, there is a lot of non-cooperation from the central govt's side (mostly from the central PWD and IAS unhelpfulness).

6. The mohalla clinic has been scrutinized way more than other govt. projects by the media too. You do not see this much focus on Swachh Bharat toilet functioning or the current state of electrification (100% is just a gimmick).

Healthcare is hard, especially for a country as vast as India, and no solution is going to reach 100% efficiency in 3 years. The central govt's insurance scheme, for example, is facing issues by [significantly underpaying doctors in good hospitals](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/ayushman-bharat-pay-us-at-least-the-cghs-rates-say-private-hospitals/story/279232.html) and it's just started.

The AAP's current 3 tier health system is great for urban areas with plenty of low-income households by reducing patient travel, costs, and the burden on more expensive and specialized secondary/tertiary care hospitals. While it can and should be improved, it's a good start.

And that is pretty much synonymous with the AAP's performance. While it can and should be improved, it's a good start for a political party in India.",2018-06-18 01:13:17

**Nirav Modi Holds At Least Six Passports, Faces Fresh FIR** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi:**

Agencies probing the alleged $2-billion PNB fraud have detected that
absconding diamond merchant Nirav Modi possessed at least half-a-dozen Indian
passports and a fresh FIR is being mulled against him for this offence,
officials said. Modi has been traced to Belgium by Indian intelligence
agencies and his frequent travels, despite the revocation of his passport,
have led the sleuths to unearth that of the six passports he held, two were
active for quite some time. The four other passports were found to be not
active, sources said.

Of the two active passports, one had Modi's full name while the other only had
his first name with a 40-month UK visa issued against it and that is probably
how he kept travelling to various countries, despite the government revoking
his first known passport earlier this year, the sources told PTI. The second
passport was also subsequently revoked by the Indian authorities.

The sources said the government, through the ministry of external affairs, has
informed the Interpol about the two revoked passports of Modi, but it appears
that in the absence of a uniform international mechanism, the legal blocking
of the documents in various countries could not be done and the fugitive
diamantaire kept using those to travel through airports and possibly seaports
too.

The revocation order of the passports has been appended to the application of
the probe agencies (CBI and ED), seeking an Interpol arrest warrant or a ""red
corner notice"" against Modi. ""It is a criminal offence to use a revoked
passport and also to possess more than one valid passport if a person does not
enjoy a special status like that of a diplomatic entity, a government employee
or on a few other grounds. ""A fresh criminal FIR may be filed against Nirav
Modi and he may face prosecution for the offence after the completion of an
internal inquiry,"" a senior official in the security establishment said.

He added that an inquiry was also being held to ascertain if Modi was using
passports issued by other countries to travel. Recently, the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have again urged the
Interpol to issue an arrest warrant against the fugitive diamantaire on the
basis of their respective chargesheets against him and others, containing
corruption and money-laundering charges. Once the Interpol issued the notice
and Modi's latest location was ascertained, the government would move for his
extradition, the sources said.

The ED will also move a special court in Mumbai to seek an official
declaration to categorise Modi as a ""fugitive"" on the basis of the prosecution
complaint (chargesheet) filed last month and for immediate confiscation of
assets worth over Rs 8,000 crore, owned by him, his family and associated
firms.

__ Comments

Modi, his uncle and jeweller Nirav Choksi and others are being probed by the
agencies after the fraud came to light, following a complaint from the Punjab
National Bank (PNB) that they allegedly cheated the nationalised bank to the
tune of over Rs 13,000 crore with the purported involvement of a few employees
of the bank. The CBI and the ED have registered two FIRs each in connection
with the case. Both Modi and Choksi are said to have left the country before
the criminal cases were lodged against them.

**Actor Prakash Raj's Swipe At PM Modi, Support For Arvind Kejriwal** 

 ______ 
Most of Prakash Raj's tweets targeting the Karnataka BJP or PM Modi are
accompanied by the -#justasking"".

**New Delhi: **

Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fitness challenge video that
sent the meme machines into hyperdrive, actor Prakash Raj asked if he could
spare a moment to sort out the tussle between Delhi Chief Minister Arvind
Kejriwal and the Lieutenant Governor.

The actor, one of the sharpest and most vocal critics of PM Modi and the
ruling party, often takes to social media to express his views. Today, he came
out in support of the Aam Aadmi Party chief, who has been sitting on a dharna
at Lt Governor Anil Baijal's official home, demanding a meeting with him.

The chief minister along with three of his colleagues -- Manish Sisodia, Gopal
Rai and Satyendar Jain -- went to meet the Mr Baijal seven days ago to discuss
a host of issues, including the ""strike"" by IAS officers. They haven't left
the guest room at the Lt Governor residence since.

On Twitter, 53-year-old Prakash Raj wrote, ""Dear supreme leader.. we know u r
busy with Fitbit challenge..yoga n exercise..can u spare a minute and take a
deep breath.. look around ...and instruct bureaucrats to work with Chief
Minister Kejriwal...(who is actually doing a good job ) and exercise your duty
too..#justasking.""

Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, too, backed Mr Kejriwal on Twitter
yesterday. Calling him a ""gentleman politician"", he urged, ""Let's shed our
arrogance/ego for the sake of Delhi and its people &amp;amp; work for a
cause.....or else the famous song of yester years in the great &amp;amp; late
Manmohan Desai's film ""

_Roti_

"" may come true - ""

_Ye public hai sab janti hai_

"". Lets address their genuine grievances before it's too late Sir. Sooner the
better. Jai Hind!""

Most of Prakash Raj's tweets targeting the Karnataka BJP or PM Modi are
accompanied by the hashtag ""justasking"", which gradually took shape of a
campaign. ""It was a hashtag I started on social media when I started asking
questions. I received great support from all over. I have succeeded in getting
people with similar thoughts on the same platform,"" he said.

__ Comments

When asked if he, too, like actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, plans to
enter politcs, Mr Raj said, he doesn't need be part of any political party to
""stand by the citizens of the country"".

""It's not important for people like me to join any political party. Also, I
have no issues with actors coming to power as long as they give me hope and
make me believe that they have something to offer to bring about a change that
we need. And anyone who offers that, we will stand by them,"" he told NDTV.

**Sitaram Yechury Leads Left Support To AAP's March Against Centre In Delhi** 

 ______ 
Sitaram Yechury said governor's office was sought to be used to ""hijack
people's mandate"" in Karnataka

**New Delhi: **

Communist Party of India-Marxist general secretary Sitaram Yechury led a band
of Left volunteers to join the march by AAP workers that aimed for the Prime
Minister's residence in Delhi on Sunday but was stopped by the police midway,
signalling closer than before ties between the opposition parties in their
confrontation with the BJP-led central government.

Mr Yechury said his party condemns the manner in which the federal feature of
the constitution was being ""undermined"" by the BJP government at the centre.

""Joining the protest rally to the prime minister's residence today to express
serious condemnation over the manner in which the federalism, a fundamental
feature of our Constitution, is being undermined by this BJP central
government,"" he said in a statement.

""Utilising the office of governors and Lt governors, the BJP central
government is seeking to destabilise non-BJP democratically-elected state
governments,"" he said.

He said the governor's office was sought to be utilised to ""hijack people's
mandate"" in Karnataka, which was thwarted.

His reference was to Karnataka governor inviting the BJP to form the
government in the state. The Congress-JD(S) post-poll alliance, however,

formed the government in Karnataka.

""Such efforts are destroying the already fragile centre-state relations which
is the backbone of the federal content of the Indian Constitution,"" Mr Yechury
said.

By stating that the communists in India were the first victims of central
""authoritarian misuse"" of constitutional provisions when the democratically-
elected government in Kerala was ""undemocratically dismissed"" in 1957, he
pointed out that this often happened with Left-led governments in Kerala and
West Bengal subsequently.

The Left's support for Mr Kejriwal came in spite of the Congress, the biggest
opposition party, coming out openly against the Delhi chief minister he should
concentrate on governance rather than theatrics, creating a rift within the
opposition unity.

The CPI(M)'s support to Mr Kejriwal came as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the
Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Janata Dal Secular (JDS)

also appeared to be supporting him

in the confrontation with the Delhi Lt. Governor and the Centre.

TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Kerala's Pinarayi
Vijayan, Andhra Pradesh's N Chandrababu Naidu and Karnataka's H D Kumaraswamy
had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath
Singh on the sidelines of

the NITI Aayog Governing Council meeting

and urged the Centre to resolve the issue.

__ Comments

Mr Kejriwal and his three cabinet colleagues have been staying put at the
waiting room at Raj Niwas, protesting against what they call a strike by Delhi
government IAS officers. One of the ministers Satyendar Jain, who was on a
hunger strike,

was hospitalised late on Sunday.

The IAS officers

have denied they are on strike.

**""Should PM React If Dog Dies?"": Pramod Muthalik On Gauri Lankesh Killing** 

 ______ 
**Bengaluru: **

Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Karnataka-based rightwing group Sri Ram
Sene, has provoked anger with a comment in defence of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi. Hitting out at people who have accused PM Modi of keeping silent on the
murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, Pramod Muthalik questioned on Sunday, ""why
should the prime minister react if some dog dies in Karnataka?""

He was speaking at a public meeting in Bengaluru.

Pramod Muthalik's Sri Ram Sene is notorious for a vicious attack in 2009, on
young men and women at a pub in Mangalore.

Investigators are looking into the outfit's possible links to the murder last
year of Gauri Lankesh, who was known for her strong views against rightwing
groups.

""Two murders happened in Karnataka and two happened in Maharashtra during the
Congress regime. No one is uttering a word over Congress government's failure.
Instead, they are asking why PM Modi is silent and not commenting on Gauri
Lankesh's death. Many wanted PM Modi to react after Lankesh's death. Why
should PM react if some dog dies in Karnataka?"" news agency ANI said quoting
Pramod Muthalik.

""Why should PM Modi react if a dog dies in Karnataka?"" said Pramod Muthalik

Muthalik's comments come three days after

Parashuram Waghmare, the last of six suspects in the Gauri Lankesh killing,

was arrested by the special investigating team (SIT).

After a photograph surfaced on social media of the Sri Ram Sene chief with the
murder accused, Muthalik admitted to knowing him. Later, he backtracked,
saying, ""There is

no connection between Sri Ram Sene and Waghmare

. He is neither our member nor our worker...This I say very clearly.""

The investigation team probing Gauri Lankesh's murder has summoned Sri Ram
Sene leader Rakesh Math for questioning, a senior police official told news
agency PTI on Friday.

__ Comments

""We have summoned Rakesh Math but he has not come yet,"" the SIT official said
adding that they wanted to find out whether Math was involved in the
assassination and whether he ""brainwashed"" Waghmare into participating in the

**On June 12, Nirav Modi travelled on Indian passport** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Jeweller

Nirav Modi

, the main accused in the

Rs 13,000 crore PNB fraud +

, travelled on his Indian passport as recently as June 12, when he took a

Eurostar

high-speed train from London to Brussels.

A source said Modi avoided taking a flight on June 12 from London, choosing to
travel by rail instead. Indian officials have verified this from European
immigration authorities who captured Modi's passport details on his trip to
Brussels.

Though

Nirav Modi's passport +

was revoked on February 24, the Central Bureau of Investigation moved the

Interpol

on June 11 for a red corner notice. The agency did so after a chargesheet was
recently filed against Modi.

In the past, requests for RCN have sometimes not succeeded in the absence of a
chargesheet and officials said Interpol has not been consistent in this
regard.

With Interpol being approached just recently, Modi could have availed of the
window available to him to travel to Brussels. Asked how Modi was still
managing to travel on a revoked passport, a foreign ministry spokesperson
said, ""We will know how he is travelling only when we are informed by
(investigating) agencies.""

According to the official, the onus of informing Interpol about revocation of
Modi's passport and imposing travel restrictions is on the investigating
agencies. The CBI had approached Interpol to get a 'diffusion notice' against
Modi which would have required member countries to inform the agency through
Interpol of Modi's presence in their jurisdiction.

Modi's passport details need to be incorporated in the international police
body's database of lost or cancelled passports which imposes travel
restrictions. His passport was revoked on a request from the CBI and the
Enforcement Directorate. However, he is understood to have made frequent trips
across Schengen countries using his Indian passport. The source said Modi,
born in Belgium, had a Singaporean passport and possibly a third one from
Morocco, which is being verified.

**Also read: ** **From Malllya to Nirav Modi, the UK remains the preferred hideout of Indian Fugitives**

The CBI and the ED registered separate cases of fraud and money laundering
against Modi in February, soon after he fled the country with his family
members when PNB reported the scam to the agencies. According to intelligence
gathered by agencies, Modi recently visited London to explore the possibility
of obtaining a long-term UK visa that would give him protection from
deportation. According to information, he was trying to obtain an ILR
(indefinite leave to remain), similar to what fugitive liquor baron

Vijay Mallya

has. An ILR makes extradition cumbersome and requires a lengthy court battle.

In Brussels, Indian authorities have informed banks and financial institutions
about the investigation against Modi, blocking his financial transactions.
However, the source said these preventive measures had hardly impacted Modi's
business as he was able to carry out operations through companies allegedly
floated by his father and associates.

The ED, which has attached Modi's assets in India worth Rs 3,000 crore, is
planning to file extradition requests with multiple countries as he has been
frequently changing locations.

**Congress draws red line on united opposition with take on Kejriwal** 

 ______ 
It will be no smooth passage for a united Opposition in 2019 with the first
red line being drawn by the Congress on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal
and

Aam Aadmi Party

(AAP).

The Congress leadership feels that though it wants a united front to take on
the BJP-Modi might in 2019, the party must also be able to retain its own
identity and position on necessary issues.

With four non-Congress chief ministers, including Congress ally H D
Kumaraswamy, rallying to support Kejriwal in the ongoing tussle with Delhi‚Äôs
Lieutenant General, the Congress has chosen to desist from participating in
this show of unity.

Senior Congress leaders, however, feel that while the four CMs-

Mamata Banerjee

, Chandrababu Naidu, H D Kumaraswamy and Pinarayi Vijayan-have no electoral
stakes in Delhi, Congress does. So, according to them, the Congress has to
maintain its distinct and different position.

‚ÄúYes, four chief ministers have extended support to Kejriwal but it must be
kept in mind that none of these have political stakes in the local context of
Delhi. Congress has significant political stakes here and the DPCC president

Ajay Maken

has made it clear that we cannot join this bandwagon. We also do not feel this
will have any implication on a national political contest,‚Äù a senior Congress
leader told ET.

In last week‚Äôs press conference, Maken had ruled out any alliance with AAP
since it had allied with RSS and people like Baba Ram Dev, Kiran Bedi in the
past.

Congress also downplayed Kumaraswamy‚Äôs support for Kejriwal. According to
Congress, owing to his personal equation, the Karnataka chief minister had
also invited the AAP leader for his swearing-in and the latest instance of
extending support is an act of reciprocation.

Another Congress leader argued that this is no reflection on Opposition unity
and the Kejriwal factor will be looked at closer to 2019.

‚ÄúWe don't feel it gives any message on opposition unity. The CMs are not
talking about fighting elections collectively or allying with AAP. This is an
AAP specific issue which Kejriwal is currently fighting for. The issue is not
related to national politics. The DPCC is also of the view that any such
alliance with the AAP will not yield us any political benefit,‚Äù another senior
leader well conversant with high-level discussions on the issue told ET.

There is, however, cause for concern as far as Opposition leadership is
concerned, others concede. The Delhi example has shown that others in the
Opposition could quickly take lead role in facilitating unity as Trinamool
chief Mamata Banerjee has done in mobilising other CMs in support of Kejriwal.

More political voices have begun to weigh in favour of Kejriwal with CPM
Sitaram Yechuri, DMK chief M KStalin, Jharkhand‚Äôs Hemant Soren sending out
messages of support, making the Congress‚Äô position look even more conspicuous.

This episode has also got the Congress thinking more carefully about the
Kejriwal factor.

There is a clear argument in the party that bringing AAP into the larger
Opposition fold will not yield any major electoral benefits. At the same time,
keeping Opposition unity in mind, there is also a view that Congress needs a
better strategy of handling AAP.

**""Can't Hold Strike In Someone's House"": Court On Arvind Kejriwal Sit-In** 

 ______ 
Arvind Kejriwal has been camping in protest at a room at Lt Governor's Raj
Niwas since last Monday

**New Delhi: **

In a strong reprimand for Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the capital's
high court today observed that his week-long sit-in at the office of the
Lieutenant Governor, Anil Baijal, is unwarranted. ""This can't be called a
strike. You can't go inside someone's office or house and hold a strike
there,"" said the court.

Mr Kejriwal is holding an unprecedented protest against the Lieutenant
Governor

, who, he says, is working in a brazenly partisan fashion and at the instance
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prevent the Delhi government from
functioning.

Specifically, the Chief Minister contends, bureaucrats or IAS officers are
refusing to show up to work - or working only selectively - and the Lieutenant
Governor must intervene to change that. The court hearing this morning was
based on a petition that argues that the protest is unconstitutional, that Mr
Kejriwal and his ministers ""consider themselves above the law"" and should be
ordered to get back to work.

The court said it will take up the case on Friday and asked for the officers
to be included in the petition.

Satyendar Jain was hospitalised on Sunday night after his health started
deteriorating.

Mr Kejriwal says till Mr Baijal asks bureaucrats to change their approach, he
will not leave the waiting room of the Lieutenant Governor's house-cum-office
in Delhi. He has been planted on sofas there with three of his senior
ministers since Monday.

Two of them - Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain - are also on a hunger strike.

Mr Jain was hospitalized last night

.

On Saturday, four

Chief Ministers including Mamata Banerjee

visited Mr Kejriwal's wife at his home after they said they were denied
permission to meet him at the Lieutenant Governor's waiting room.

They urged the Prime Minister yesterday to resolve the crisis

and said Mr Baijal's role in it proves that the centre is bent on violating
the federalism that is essential to India's political structure.

The ""sofa

_dharna_

"" has been challenged this morning in the high court by BJP leader Vijender
Gupta.

The conflict with IAS officers erupted late in February when Anshu Prakash,
the Chief Secretary or senior-most bureaucrat, alleged that he was assaulted
at a midnight meeting at the Chief Minister's house.

Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party or AAP denies the accusation

; CCTV footage from Mr Kejriwal's house as been examined by the Delhi police
and he was interrogated for several hours, a move that was also described by
political opponents of the BJP as blatant harassment of an elected Chief
Minister.

Yesterday,

IAS officers denied that they were on ""strike""

and said they skipped meetings only when they felt their safety and self-
respect was at risk.

Mr Kejriwal, from his sofa _dharna_, issued a statement

, promising to ""ensure their safety and security with all powers and resources
available at my command"" and describing them as ""part of my family.""

__ Comments

The bureaucrats are seen as caught in the middle of the crossfire between AAP
and the BJP, which is often accused by regional parties, including some of its
own allies, of disrespecting the basic rights of states.

Mr Kejriwal claims that since his AAP won all but three seats in Delhi in
2015, defeating the BJP's campaign which was led by PM Modi, he is being
punished for a victory that Mr Modi cannot come to terms with.

**Arun Jaitley hints at no cut in excise on oil, asks citizens to pay taxes honestly** 

 ______ 
To reduce dependence on oil as a revenue source, Union Minister

Arun Jaitley

today urged citizens to pay their due share of taxes ""honestly"".

He virtually ruled out any cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel saying it
could prove to be counter-productive.

Commenting on India's taxation record, he further said that while salaried
class pay their due share of taxes, ""most other sections"" have to improve
their tax payment record, which is keeping India ""far from being a tax-
compliant society"".

""My earnest appeal, therefore, to political leaders and opinion makers
...would be that evasion in the non-oil tax category must be stopped and, if
people pay their taxes honestly, the high dependence on oil products for
taxation eventually comes down. In the medium and long run, upsetting the
fiscal maths can prove counter-productive,"" Jaitley said.

In a facebook post titled 'The Economy and the Markets Reward Structural
Reforms and Fiscal Prudence', Jaitley said in last four years, central

government's tax-GDP ratio

has improved from 10 per cent to 11.5 per cent. Almost half of this, 0.72 per
cent of GDP, accounts for an increase in non-oil tax-GDP ratio.

The level of non-oil taxes to GDP at 9.8 per cent in 2017-18 is the highest
since 2007-08 - a year in which our revenue position was boosted by buoyant
international environment, he said.

""This government has established a very strong reputation for fiscal prudence
and macro-economically responsible behaviour. We know what happened during the
Taper Tantrum of 2013. Fiscal indiscipline can lead to borrowing more and
obviously increase the cost of debt.

""Reliefs to consumers can only be given by a fiscally responsible and a
financially sound central government, and the states which are earning extra
due to abnormal increase in oil prices,"" Jaitley said.

In an apparent dig at senior Congress leader P Chidambaram's remark that tax
on oil should be cut by Rs 25 per litre, Jaitley retorted ""this is a 'trap'
suggestion"".

Without naming Chidambaram, Jaitley noted that the ""distinguished predecessor""
had ""never endeavoured to do so himself.""

""It is intended to push India into an unmanageable debt - something which the

UPA government

left as its legacy. We must remember that the economy and the markets reward
structural reforms, fiscal prudence, and macro-economic stability.

""They punish fiscal indiscipline and irresponsibility. The transformation from
UPA's ""policy paralysis"" to the NDA's ""fastest growing economy"" conclusively
demonstrates this. The government is aspiring to improve the tax-GDP ratio,""
Jaitley said.

Chidambaram had last week claimed that it was possible for the centre to cut
tax by up to Rs 25 per litre on petrol prices but the Modi-government will not
do so.

As per government estimates, every rupee cut in excise duty on petrol and
diesel will result in a revenue loss of about Rs 13,000 crore.

The price of

Indian basket of crude

surged from USD 66 a barrel in April to around USD 74 currently.

Jaitley said despite higher compliances in new system, as far as the non-oil
taxes are concerned, India is still far from being a tax complaint society.

""Salaried employees is one category of tax compliant assessees. Most other
sections still have to improve their track record. The effort for next few
years has to be to replicate the last four years and improve India's tax to
GDP ratio by another 1.5 per cent.

""The increase must come from the non-oil segment since there is scope for
improvement,"" he said.

These additions, Jaitley said, have to come by more and more people performing
their patriotic duty of paying the non-oil taxes to the State.

""The tragedy of the honest tax payer is that he not only pays his own share of
taxes but also has to compensate for the evader,"" he said.

Jaitley said the central government collects taxes in the form of income tax,
its own share of GST and the customs duty. 42 per cent of the central
government taxes are shared with the states.

State governments collect their 50 per cent from GST besides their

local taxes

. These are independent of taxes on petroleum products. The states charge ad
valorem taxes on oil. If oil prices go up, states earn more, he said.

**India lines up Dornier aircraft for Seychelles** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

India

is planning to gift a

Dornier aircraft

to Seychelles and explore trilateral cooperation involving France that will
safeguard its strategic interests in the backdrop of President Danny Faure‚Äôs
announcement to cancel the project to jointly develop a naval base on

Assumption Island

ahead of his June 25 Delhi visit.

India plans to gift Seychelles a Dornier aircraft this month -- second such
aircraft that could be gifted to the Indian Ocean Region, said people aware of
the matter.

An Indo-French-Seychelles trilateral cooperation may safeguard India‚Äôs
strategic interests in the key

Indian Ocean country

amid China‚Äôs growing interests in the region.

India and France joined hands in March for strategic partnership in the
western part of the Indian Ocean region. The two countries share a logistic
service agreement to support each other naval forces in the Indian Ocean
Region. France also has strategic interests in Seychelles and recently engaged
with Faure to expand French-Seychelles strategic ties.

ET has learnt that India is helping revive an old airstrip on Assumption
Island along with other upgradation work.

The proposed joint project, the scrapping of which is yet to be officially
communicated to the Indian defence establishment, entailed investment of $550
million in the development of an airstrip, jetty and housing infrastructure
for the Seychelles Coast Guard in Assumption Island.

While Faure had mentioned in his June 4 press meet that there would be no
discussion on the project during his India visit ‚Äì the third meet between him
and PM Narendra Modi this year ‚Äì the project signed in 2015 and revised in
January 2018 will cast a shadow on the visit.

Experts said the project is a victim of domestic politics in Seychelles, where
the opposition is not willing to compromise and has made it a controversial
issue of violation of Seychelles sovereignty to pin down Faure government.
However, India is approaching the issue deftly to prevent Faure‚Äôs visit
getting entangled in domestic politics.

Changes in foreign secretary and principal secretary in Seychelles have slowed
progress further. The biggest setback was the text of the detailed project
report (DPR) being leaked on YouTube, sparking a controversy and questions
over the nature of the deal.

The controversy, however, could not dent growing defence ties between India
and Seychelles. In 2017, 11 Indian naval ships visited Seychelles and eight
have visited Seychelles so far this year. Half of Seychelles‚Äô military assets
have been provided by India, which has trained around 70% of Seychelles‚Äô
military personnel.

excise duty on petrol and diesel saying it could prove to be counter-
productive.

While salaried class pay their due share of taxes, Jaitley said ""most other
sections"" have to improve their tax payment record, which is keeping India
""far from being a tax-compliant society"".

""My earnest appeal, therefore, to political leaders and opinion makers
...would be that evasion in the non-oil tax category must be stopped and, if
people pay their taxes honestly, the high dependence on oil products for
taxation eventually comes down. In the medium and long run, upsetting the
fiscal maths can prove counter-productive,"" Jaitley said.

In a Facebook post titled 'The Economy and the Markets Reward Structural
Reforms and Fiscal Prudence', Jaitley said in last four years, central
government's tax-GDP ratio has improved from 10 per cent to 11.5 per cent.
Almost half of this, 0.72 per cent of GDP, accounts for an increase in non-oil
tax-GDP ratio.

The level of non-oil taxes to GDP at 9.8 per cent in 2017-18 is the highest
since 2007-08 - a year in which our revenue position was boosted by buoyant
international environment, he said.

""This government has established a very strong reputation for fiscal prudence
and macro-economically responsible behaviour. We know what happened during the
Taper Tantrum of 2013. Fiscal indiscipline can lead to borrowing more and
obviously increase the cost of debt.

""Reliefs to consumers can only be given by a fiscally responsible and a
financially sound central government, and the states which are earning extra
due to abnormal increase in oil prices,"" Jaitley said.

In an apparent dig at senior Congress leader P Chidambaram's remark that tax
on oil should be cut by Rs 25 per litre, Jaitley retorted ""this is a 'trap'
suggestion"".

Without naming Chidambaram, Jaitley noted that the ""distinguished predecessor""
had ""never endeavoured to do so himself.""

""It is intended to push India into an unmanageable debt - something which the
UPA government left as its legacy. We must remember that the economy and the
markets reward structural reforms, fiscal prudence, and macro-economic
stability.

""They punish fiscal indiscipline and irresponsibility. The transformation from
UPA's ""policy paralysis"" to the NDA's ""fastest growing economy"" conclusively
demonstrates this. The government is aspiring to improve the tax-GDP ratio,""
Jaitley said.

Chidambaram had last week claimed that it was possible for the centre to cut
tax by up to Rs 25 per litre on petrol prices but the Modi-government will not
do so.

As per government estimates, every rupee cut in excise duty on petrol and
diesel will result in a revenue loss of about Rs 13,000 crore.

The price of Indian basket of crude surged from $66 a barrel in April to
around $74 currently.

Jaitley said despite higher compliances in new system, as far as the non-oil
taxes are concerned, India is still far from being a tax complaint society.

""Salaried employees is one category of tax compliant assessees. Most other
sections still have to improve their track record. The effort for next few
years has to be to replicate the last four years and improve India's tax to
GDP ratio by another 1.5 per cent.

""The increase must come from the non-oil segment since there is scope for
improvement,"" he said.

These additions, Jaitley said, have to come by more and more people performing
their patriotic duty of paying the non-oil taxes to the State.

""The tragedy of the honest tax payer is that he not only pays his own share of
taxes but also has to compensate for the evader,"" he said.

Jaitley said the central government collects taxes in the form of income tax,
its own share of GST and the customs duty. 42 per cent of the central
government taxes are shared with the states.

State governments collect their 50 per cent from GST besides their local
taxes. These are independent of taxes on petroleum products. The states charge
ad valorem taxes on oil. If oil prices go up, states earn more, he said.

**""Can't Hold Strike In Someone's House"": Court On Arvind Kejriwal Sit-In** 

 ______ 
Arvind Kejriwal has been camping in protest at a room at Lt Governor's Raj
Niwas since last Monday

**New Delhi: **

In a strong reprimand for Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the capital's
high court today observed that his week-long sit-in at the office of the
Lieutenant Governor, Anil Baijal, is unwarranted. ""This can't be called a
strike. You can't go inside someone's office or house and hold a strike
there,"" said the court.

Mr Kejriwal is holding an unprecedented protest against the Lieutenant
Governor

, who, he says, is working in a brazenly partisan fashion and at the instance
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prevent the Delhi government from
functioning.

Specifically, the Chief Minister contends, bureaucrats or IAS officers are
refusing to show up to work - or working only selectively - and the Lieutenant
Governor must intervene to change that. The court hearing this morning was
based on a petition that argues that the protest is unconstitutional, that Mr
Kejriwal and his ministers ""consider themselves above the law"" and should be
ordered to get back to work.

The court said it will take up the case on Friday and asked for the officers
to be included in the petition.

Satyendar Jain was hospitalised on Sunday night after his health started
deteriorating.

Mr Kejriwal says till Mr Baijal asks bureaucrats to change their approach, he
will not leave the waiting room of the Lieutenant Governor's house-cum-office
in Delhi. He has been planted on sofas there with three of his senior
ministers since Monday.

Two of them - Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain - are also on a hunger strike.

Mr Jain was hospitalized last night

.

On Saturday, four

Chief Ministers including Mamata Banerjee

visited Mr Kejriwal's wife at his home after they said they were denied
permission to meet him at the Lieutenant Governor's waiting room.

They urged the Prime Minister yesterday to resolve the crisis

and said Mr Baijal's role in it proves that the centre is bent on violating
the federalism that is essential to India's political structure. ""There is a
dharna at Chief Minister's office too. Who has allowed it?"" AAP leader Sanjay
Singh said.

The ""sofa

_dharna_

"" has been challenged this morning in the high court by BJP leader Vijender
Gupta.

The conflict with IAS officers erupted late in February when Anshu Prakash,
the Chief Secretary or senior-most bureaucrat, alleged that he was assaulted
at a midnight meeting at the Chief Minister's house.

Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party or AAP denies the accusation

; CCTV footage from Mr Kejriwal's house as been examined by the Delhi police
and he was interrogated for several hours, a move that was also described by
political opponents of the BJP as blatant harassment of an elected Chief
Minister.

Yesterday,

IAS officers denied that they were on ""strike""

and said they skipped meetings only when they felt their safety and self-
respect was at risk.

Mr Kejriwal, from his sofa _dharna_, issued a statement

, promising to ""ensure their safety and security with all powers and resources
available at my command"" and describing them as ""part of my family.""

__ Comments

The bureaucrats are seen as caught in the middle of the crossfire between AAP
and the BJP, which is often accused by regional parties, including some of its
own allies, of disrespecting the basic rights of states.

Mr Kejriwal claims that since his AAP won all but three seats in Delhi in
2015, defeating the BJP's campaign which was led by PM Modi, he is being
punished for a victory that Mr Modi cannot come to terms with.

**Countries Let Nirav Modi Travel On Cancelled Passport Despite Alert** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

Fugitive jeweler Nirav Modi managed to travel through several countries even
though information about his passport being cancelled by India was flashed in
the Interpol central database on February 24, the CBI said today.

According to the UK,

Nirav Modi used the passport to fly from New York to London

on February 10, from Hong Kong to London on February 15, from London to Hog
Kong on March 15, from New York to London on March 28 and from London to Paris
on March 31.

The CBI said it had shared the information on his passport in the 'diffusion'
notice issued through Interpol on February 15. But Interpol branches of
Belgium and US didn't cooperate, say sources.

A diffusion, which is less formal than a red corner notice, is a request to
the Interpol seeking the arrest of a person or any information on them.

PNB fraud: The CBI has approached Interpol for Red Corner Notice aimed at
bringing Nirav Modi

""After the passport was cancelled by External Affairs Ministry, we had updated
this information in the diffusion notice. The information that passport of
Nirav Modi has been revoked was provided in the Interpol central database,
available to all the member countries, on February 24,"" CBI spokesperson
Abhishek Dayal said.

The

CBI followed it up with six countries where Nirav Modi was suspected to have
fled

and requested these countries to share information about him.

Reminders were sent to the Interpol coordination agency of UK on April 25, May
22, May 24 and May 28, agency sources said.

Similar reminders were also sent to the agencies of US, Singapore, Belgium,
UAE and France.

__ Comments

Nirav Modi is accused of a mega swindle of the Punjab National Bank (PNB), the
second-largest government bank, by securing overseas loans worth Rs 13,000
crore through fraud guarantees. He and his uncle fled India in January, weeks
before the CBI started investigating the PNB fraud.

The CBI has approached the Interpol for a Red Corner Notice aimed at bringing
Nirav Modi back for facing trial in the cases against them.

And that is where a strong willed government comes into the picture.

If Modi government had shown a similar enthusiasm in identifying corrupt government machinery from ground/bottom up... we might have been doing a bit better by now.

**'Who authorised the dharna?' Delhi high court asks AAP ministers** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI:

Delhi high court

(HC) today asked who authorised the

sit-in +

, or 'dharna', that Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government ministers
including Delhi chief minister (CM)

Arvind Kejriwal

have been on since June 11 at the Lieutenant Governor's official residence.

The observation by a bench of Justices A K Chawla and Navin Chawla came during
the hearing of two petitions, one against the sit-in by

Kejriwal

and the others against the alleged strike by the IAS officers of Delhi
government. The HC was also today approached by

BJP

MLA Vijender Gupta who's seeking a court order to Kejriwal to end his
'dharna'.

**Live updates: Delhi High Court pulls up Kejriwal govt over dharna**

The AAP leaders are demanding that IAS officers in the Capital end their
'undeclared strike'. Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and
cabinet minister Gopal Rai and

health minister Satyendar Jain +

have been on a sit-in strike at Raj Niwas, the official residence of
Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, since June 11. They want Baijal to issue a
directive to the civil servants to end their strike, among other demands.

The lawyer representing the Delhi government ministers told the court that
these IAS officers yesterday acknowledged they aren't attending meetings
called by ministers. The HC turned the question on the AAP leaders.

""Thing is that you're sitting on a 'dharna'. Who authorized to sit on a dharna
like this?"" asked the HC.

""Who authorised Kerjiwal's dharna at LG residence?"" Delhi HC raps AAP

01:27

When the Delhi government lawyer said it was the ministers' individual
decision, the HC again demanded to know, ""Is it authorised?"", and added that
such a demonstration can't be termed a strike.

""This can‚Äôt be called a strike. You can‚Äôt go inside someone‚Äôs office or house
and hold a strike there,"" the HC added. The bench pointed out that the CM and
others are sitting inside the LG's office and not outside his office or at the
door.

The bench also decided to make the IAS association a party to the proceedings
and adjourned the case for Friday.

The Capital's bureaucrats are allegedly on strike to protest an alleged
assault on chief secretary Anshul Prakash in February by two AAP MLAs at
Kejriwal's residence. Delhi's IAS association yesterday held an unprecedented
press conference to counter AAP's claim that its officers are on strike and
said that they are being ""targeted ""and ""victimised"".

The officers were addressing the media after Delhi government alleged that
bureaucrats in the national capital have been ""hindering"" the work of the AAP-
led government and have alleged that they have been staging a strike for the
last four months.

Last week, Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

, seeking his intervention to end the IAS officers' ""strike"" claiming that Lt
Governor Baijal was doing ""nothing"" to break the impasse.

In his letter to Modi, Kejriwal cited instances when the government work was
stuck as the officers have not been attending meetings with ministers for the
past three months.

He said cleaning of drains before monsoon, setting up of mohalla clinics and
measures to curb air pollution in Delhi are stuck because of the alleged
strike by the IAS officers.

Two days ago, several opposition chief ministers came out in support of the
Kejriwal government. CMs

Mamata Banerjee

, N Chandrababu Naidu, Pinarayi Vijayan and H D Kumaraswamy urged PM Modi to
resolve Kejriwal's standoff with the bureaucracy in the Capital.

The CMs sought Modi out during the meeting of the Niti Aayog's governing
council here on Sunday with Banerjee tweeting, ""I, along with CMs of Andhra
Pradesh,

Karnataka

and Kerala, have requested PM today to resolve problems of the Delhi
government immediately.""

**Don‚Äôt doubt govt intention in appointing next CJI, says Ravi Shankar Prasad**

Written by

Kaunain Sheriff M

Updated: June 19, 2018 7:14:41 am

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. (Express Photo/File)

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said that the government‚Äôs
‚Äúintention should not be doubted‚Äù over the appointment of the next Chief
Justice of India, and the Centre will ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù the appointment of CJI Dipak
Misra‚Äôs successor after he recommends a name for elevation.

Asked whether the government will follow the convention of appointing Justice
Ranjan Gogoi as the next CJI when Misra demits office on October 2, the
minister said the question is ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù, and that the convention is ‚Äúclear‚Äù:
that the ‚Äúsitting chief justice names the seniormost judge (of the top court)
as successor‚Äù.

Prasad said, ‚ÄúWhen the name comes to us (government), we will discuss it‚Ä¶. But
no one has the right to doubt our intention (on appointment of the next CJI).‚Äù

**Also read | Don‚Äôt abuse data to influence elections: Ravi Shankar Prasad to companies**

Responding to a question on the Law Ministry seeking opinion of the Attorney
General on the proposal to start All-India Judicial Services for appointment
in lower judiciary, Prasad said the government will not encroach upon the
autonomy of high courts as far as subordinate judiciary is concerned. But, he
said, there is a ‚Äúcompelling need for a centralised selection process‚Äù of
judges.

Pointing out that there are 5,436 vacancies in lower judiciary, the minister
said the Central government ‚Äî‚Äúand also perhaps the state government‚Äù‚Äî however
has no role in appointments in lower judiciary. ‚ÄúOnly the High Court makes the
appointments by holding the examination. I have written to the Chief Justice
of India that we need to fill it up (vacancies)‚Ä¶. It is very important that
there must be infusion of new talent in subordinate judiciary,‚Äù Prasad said.

He said, ‚ÄúI am very keen that young (graduates) coming from National Law
Schools also take these examinations. I am very keen that the marginalised
communities, SC/ST and OBC, get representation. This is how a new pool will be
created‚Ä¶. But we don‚Äôt want to encroach upon the autonomy of high courts as
far as subordinate judiciary is concerned.‚Äù

There is, however, a ‚Äúcompelling need for a centralised selection process‚Äù of
judges, he added.

In the backdrop of the tussle between the executive and the judiciary over
appointment of judges, Prasad pointed out that besides the stay on judges‚Äô
appointment in 2014 and 2015 due to the NJAC Act issue, the Centre has
appointed 126 judges in 2016 and 117 judges in 2017, and that the appointment
of more judges is in the pipeline.

‚ÄúWe will surpass our own record of (appointing 126 judges in 2016) when this
year comes to an end,‚Äù he said.

Addressing the media to highlight the Law Ministry‚Äôs achievements in the four
years of the Narendra Modi government, Prasad also said that the government is
in discussions to finalise the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment
of judges. ‚ÄúWe are discussing (the) MoP. The Government of India and the
Supreme Court need to jointly decide on it‚Ä¶. However, our (government) view
(on MoP) is that norms of those selected (as judges) have to be mentioned (in
the document),‚Äù he said.

**Officer skips meet on ration, AAP calls it ‚Äòdirty politics‚Äô** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Even though there were signs a reconciliation between

AAP

government and officers on Monday, food commissioner

Mohanjeet Singh

skipped a meeting on ration called by minister

Imran Hussain

. At a separate meeting called by Hussain on environment, all officers who
were invited were in attendance. Both meetings were held in Hussain‚Äôs chamber
at the secretariat.

Singh‚Äôs absence prompted AAP to question whether it was due to the ‚Äúfear of
personal safety‚Äù. An AAP leader asked: ‚ÄúThe environment secretary found it
safe to attend the meeting called by the minister, but the food commissioner
found it unsafe?‚Äù At a press conference on Sunday,

IAS officers

had said that they were avoiding those meetings that they considered ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù.

Hussain then rescheduled the meeting on ration for Tuesday. On agenda is a
review of the distribution of ration to eligible beneficiaries in June and
availability at fairprice shops.

‚ÄúThe commissioner was absent at the meeting without intimation,‚Äù AAP‚Äôs Delhi
chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said, adding that the minister had
desired the presence of all officials concerned for the Tuesday meeting. The
distribution of ration has been a subject of the recent tussle between AAP
government and LG, with the government keen on bringing in the doorstep
delivery scheme to end the alleged corruption and pilferage. ‚ÄúIt proves
boycotting the meetings of ministers has nothing to do with safety and
security. It‚Äôs just dirty politics,‚Äù Bharadwaj said.

Singh didn‚Äôt respond to calls and messages by TOI.

Meanwhile, support continued to pour in for AAP with Samajwadi Party leader
Ram Gopal Yadav and CPI‚Äôs D Raja visiting LNJP hospital to meet deputy CM
Manish Sisodia and health minister Satyendar Jain. ‚ÄúThe Centre has kept mum on
the issue. If needed, we will also sit on dharna,‚Äù Yadav said. CM Arvind
Kejriwal thanked the two for ‚Äúraising their voice against the assault on
democracy in Delhi by PM Narendra Modi‚Äù.

Even though both AAP government and IAS officers have agreed for talks, AAP is
likely to go ahead with its signature campaign to garner support if there is
no breakthrough. ‚ÄúWe will start a signature campaign on Tuesday. We will go
door-to-door to get the signature of people. Our target is to get at least 10
lakh signatures,‚Äù RS MP Sanjay Singh said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's sit-in protest

and the resulting impasse in Delhi. While the main target was Prime Minister
Narendra Modi, his party and the Chief Minister both were mentioned as
ingredients in what he called ""anarchy"". Even the bureaucrats, who made their
grievances public at a rare press conference on Sunday, got a mention in the
tweet.

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt; Delhi bureaucrats addressing press conferences.  
&gt;  
&gt; PM turns a blind eye to the anarchy; rather nudges chaos &amp;amp; disorder.  
&gt;  
&gt; People of Delhi are the victims, as this drama plays out.

&gt;

&gt; ‚Äî Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) June 18, 2018

This is the first time Mr Gandhi has referred to the week-long protest by the
Delhi Chief Minister at the house of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. The
leaders of the party -- which got wiped out by AAP in the 2015 assembly
elections after three terms in power -- have heaped criticism on Mr Kejriwal.
The list of detractors not only includes state party chief Ajay Maken but also

former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit

.

AAP attacked the Congress president. The party's lawmaker Sanjay Singh said Mr
Gandhi was speaking the ""language of BJP"" and challenged him to ask his Delhi
unit's leaders to go on hunger strike for even two days. AAP leader Saurabh
Bharadwaj said instead of listening to Congress state unit chief Ajay Maken,
Mr Gandhi should talk to his elected Puducherry chief minister.

The stance of the Congress has placed it far apart from the other opposition
parties when efforts are on to build a common front to oust the BJP from power
in next year's general elections.

Most opposition parties, and even BJP allies Shiv Sena and Nitish Kumar's
Janata Dal United, have rallied behind Mr Kejriwal.

The matter has seen longtime rivals like Mamata Banerjee and the CPM on the
same side. While Ms Banerjee, along with three other Chief Ministers, appealed
to PM Modi yesterday to intervene in the issue, CPM cadres took part in
yesterday's AAP protest and its senior leader Sitaram Yechury accused the
government of undermining the principles of federalism.

The Congress chief minister of Puducherry, V Narayanasamy, who has similar
complaints against Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, also sounded positive about
the protest.

__ Comments

The Aam Aadmi Party -- which has accused PM Modi of exacting vengeance against
it for losing in the 2015 assembly elections -- has accused the Congress of
being the ""B Team"" of the BJP.

Mr Kejriwal

\-- who started his protest on the evening of June 11 -- has accused
Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and the Centre of backing the IAS officers,
who, he says, have been on strike sinec February. He has also started a
campaign demanding full statehood for Delhi, which would give its elected
government control over some crucial issues, including land and police.

**Uddhav Thackeray calls Arvind Kejriwal, expresses solidarity with AAP** 

 ______ 
Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena is the first NDA partner to take a stand in
support of the AAP government.

**Mumbai:** The Shiv Sena in Maharashtra expressed solidarity with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), a day after chief ministers of four states and a few regional leaders expressed support for AAP‚Äôs _dharna _against Delhi‚Äôs lieutenant governor (L-G), becoming the first constituent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to formally take a stand in support of the AAP government. 

Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said Sena chief Uddhav
Thackeray telephoned AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on
Monday to ‚Äútalk about the political situation in Delhi‚Äù.

Raut said it was ‚Äúunfair and undemocratic of bureaucracy in any state to work
against a democratically-elected government‚Äù. He said Thackeray told Kejriwal
that ‚Äúhis was an elected government that had every democratic right to work
for Delhi and whatever was happening with the AAP government was not good for
democracy‚Äù.

Raut, however, said he had no information on whether Thackeray had extended
support to the AAP protest at the L-G‚Äôs residence. ‚ÄúThe telephone conversation
was limited to only the situation in Delhi and nothing more should be read in
that,‚Äù Raut said.

‚ÄúIf bureaucracy works against an elected government, it is wrong and against
democracy. Be it Gujarat or Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra or the state of
Delhi, it is wrong,‚Äù Raut added.

The Shiv Sena‚Äôs solidarity with AAP comes in the wake of the former‚Äôs frequent
criticism of the Modi government and the BJP. Last month after the Shiv Sena
lost out to the BJP in the Palghar bypoll, Thackeray had called upon all
political parties to raise their voice against the Election Commission of
India to ‚Äúsave democracy‚Äù.

Meanwhile, Kejriwal‚Äôs sit in protest at the L-G‚Äôs residence continued for a
seventh day on Monday. His deputy, Manish Sisodia, who was on hunger strike
since 13 June was hospitalised on Monday after his health deteriorated.
Earlier, cabinet colleague Satyendra Jain was hospitalised. Jain‚Äôs condition
is stable now.

A day after the IAS officers association denied that they were on strike, on
Monday they said they were open to discussions with the government. ‚ÄúWe look
forward to concrete interventions for our security &amp;amp; dignity. We are open
to formal discussions with Hon‚Äôble CM on this matter,‚Äù association of officers
of the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union territories) cadre
tweeted.

**Life and money: The economic cost of North India‚Äôs worsening air pollution** 

 ______ 
Deadly dust storms sweeping over the densely-populated north Indian plains are
part of a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù of disruptive weather events worsening the country‚Äôs
already-lethal air pollution and causing disruption in the $2.3 trillion
economy.

In recent months, dust clouds and storms have killed hundreds of people,
destroyed thousands of homes and farmers‚Äô crops and led to flight
cancellations. The government in New Delhi, a city of more than 20 million
people, ordered a halt to construction activities as the airborne sand
significantly worsened north India‚Äôs air quality, far outside the winter
months that usually herald the region‚Äôs descent into a months-long toxic haze.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely a new normal -- the frequency and intensity of these storms
is unprecedented,‚Äù said Sunita Narain, director general of New Delhi‚Äôs Centre
for Science and Environment, who added that recent weather is related to
desertification, deforestation and an over-extraction of groundwater.

In India, extreme weather events can quickly lead to dozens of deaths and
cause economic hardship, with the World Bank estimating that environmental
degradation costs India roughly $80 billion each year. At the same time,
soaring levels of tiny, deadly particulate matter have prompted concern about
a brewing public health emergency in the politically-gridlocked capital, where
doctors warn of rising lung cancer and heart disease cases.

**Economic threat**

In 2018 alone, there have been 50 severe storms across 16 Indian states that
have led to more than 500 deaths, compared to 22 storms between 2003 and 2017,
and only nine between 1980 and 2003, the CSE said. Nearly 5,000 houses
collapsed, while livestock were killed and crops were ruined across the states
of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and others, according to a report by
the CSE.

Flights were cancelled across north India on airlines including Air India,
Indigo and Spice Jet, said Kapil Sabharwal, a spokesman for New Delhi‚Äôs
airport.

The worsening air pollution across north India in the summer has also prompted
renewed concerns that it‚Äôs no longer just a winter phenomenon, but a year-long
public health crisis. In March, April and May, air monitoring stations in
Delhi recorded just one day of ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù air quality, data compiled by
the Central Pollution Control Board show.

Poor air quality also poses a threat to Delhi‚Äôs economy. ‚ÄúWhen there is such
visible pollution, the danger is certain steps may be taken that hamper
business continuity,‚Äù said Seema Arora, deputy director general of the Delhi-
based CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development, citing past
bans on the entry of trucks carrying ‚Äònon-essential‚Äô goods into the capital.
‚ÄúSuch actions can result in a huge amount of impact, especially for small and
medium businesses‚Äù

**Political fallout**

Any response to worsening pollution levels has been complicated by gridlock in
India‚Äôs capital, where New Delhi‚Äôs political leaders have sparred with their
own bureaucracy and representatives of the national government.

Delhi‚Äôs Aam Aadmi Party, led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal -- a political
opponent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- has been holding a hunger strike
in the waiting room of the state‚Äôs lieutenant governor. They allege
administrators in Delhi‚Äôs bureaucracy have boycotted their work, including
combating pollution, while bureaucrats claim AAP lawmakers assaulted Delhi‚Äôs
chief secretary.

The political crisis has drawn in a variety of opposition leaders, including
the chief minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee, who tweeted that they had
urged the prime minister to resolve the problems immediately.

Still, Narain said all parties managed to unite to implement a ban on
construction in the national capital. ‚ÄúIt has transcended politics,‚Äù she said,
adding she has met with Delhi‚Äôs lieutenant governor and chief minister. ‚ÄúThe
policies are moving. Air pollution is something that‚Äôs reached the highest
level.‚Äù

* Nepal has moved closer to China. 

* Sri Lanka is closer to China and has allowed then to build a naval base. Despite all the bravado China has us surrounded.

* Status quo with China and at Doka La. We haven't improved relations with any of our neighbours. If all your neighbours dislike you then maybe the problem is with you?

You have very much visibility into your local politics, but you chose to ignore this fact as you believe without Modi losing these problems can be fixed. Even to prove you I will give you an example, in our local ward a young educated man stood for election, he was supported by a regional party who had no chance of winning the district, state and even the ward, yet he showed resolve and went house to house propagating his agenda which included basic stuff like fixing water and road problems, getting rid of garbage and illegal slums - people voted for him

he managed to complete half of those things he promised in 4 years and then ended up in BJP as they dumped their candidate for him, because they believe in winning not simple sticking to their ideal candidate, When the person joined BJP, can you imagine whom did the people vote ? The regional party whom the candidate left or BJP who bagged the most ideal and proven candidate - He won with BJP on his back and appeared as a small dot in the massive saffron garland in 14', however he continued his work thereafter and is popular now, some vote for him because he has done good work ( irrespective of BJP affiliation) and some vote him because of Modi, However in the end, its BJP who wins by selecting the right candidates, No one stopped congress from Bagging him when he was independent or with lesser party, Congress kept fielding the same old corrupt politician whom no one saw except unnecessary hoardings, no one even knew if the congress candidate was from the same area, let alone be aware about its problems.

This is how democracy works in Educated and developed parts of India, I have seen with my own eyes, Its painfully slowly but getting the right ingredient for the food you will eat is more important than how good the entire Buffet was. ",2018-06-19 21:14:19

474,"It has discredited the media, so now every criticism is brushed off as a journalist who didn‚Äôt get paid by BJP or is on the payrolls of Congress. I know several journalists for whom the allegation can‚Äôt be true, but more importantly, no one ever addresses the accusation or complaint ‚Äî they just attack the person raising the issue and ignore the issue itself.

It has peddled a narrative that nothing happened in India in 70 years.

This is patently false and the mentality is harmful to the nation. This government spent over Rs. 4,000 crore of our taxpayer money on advertisements and now that will become the trend. Do small works and huge branding. He isn‚Äôt the first one to build roads ‚Äî some of the best roads I‚Äôve traveled on were pet projects of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav. India became an IT powerhouse from the 90s. It is easy to measure past performance and berate past leaders based on the circumstances of today, just one example of that:

Why did Congress not build toilets in 70 years?

They couldn‚Äôt even do something so basic. This argument sounds logical and I believed it too, until I started reading India‚Äôs history. When we gained independence in 1947 we were an extremely poor country, we didn‚Äôt have the resources for even basic infrastructure and no capital. To counteract this PM Nehru went down the socialist path and created PSU‚Äôs. We had no capacity to build steel, so with the help of Russians the Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC), Ranchi was set up that made machines to make steel in India ‚Äî without this we would have no steel, and consequently no infrastructure.

That was the agenda ‚Äî basic industries and infra. We had frequent droughts (aakaal), every 2‚Äì3 years and a large number of people starved to death. The priority was to feed the people, toilets were a luxury no one cared for. The Green Revolution happened and the food shortages disappeared by the 1990s ‚Äî now we have a surplus problem. The toilet situation is exactly like people asking 25 years from now why Modi couldn‚Äôt make all houses in India air conditioned. That seems like a luxury today, toilets were also a luxury at some point of time. Maybe things could have happened sooner, maybe 10‚Äì15 years ago, but nothing happened in 70 years is a horrible lie to peddle.

3. The spread and reliance on Fake News

There is some anti-BJP fake news too, but the pro-BJP and anti-opposition fake news outstrips that by miles in number and in reach. Some of it is supporters, but a lot of it comes from the party. It is often hateful and polarizing, which makes it even worse. The online news portals backed by this government are damaging society more than we know.

4. Hindu Khatre Mein Hain

They‚Äôve ingrained it into the minds of people that Hindus and Hinduism are in danger, and that Modi is the only option to save ourselves. In reality Hindus have been living the same lives much before this government and nothing has changed except people‚Äôs mindset. Were we Hindus in danger in 2007? At least I didn‚Äôt hear about it everyday and I see no improvement in the condition of Hindus, just more fear mongering and hatred.

5. Speak against the government and you‚Äôre anti-National and more recently, anti-Hindu

Legitimate criticism of the government is shut up with this labeling. Prove your nationalism, sing Vande Mataram everywhere (even though BJP leaders don‚Äôt know the words themselves, they‚Äôll force you to sing it!). I‚Äôm a proud nationalist and my nationalism won‚Äôt allow me to let anyone force me to showcase it! I will sing the national anthem and national song with pride when the occasion calls for it, or when I feel like it, but I won‚Äôt let anyone force me to sing it based on their whims!

6. Running news channels that are owned by BJP leaders who‚Äôs sole job is to debate Hindu-Muslim, National-Antinational, India-Pakistan and derail the public discourse from issues and logic into polarizing emotions. You all know exactly which ones, and you all even know the debaters who‚Äôre being rewarded for spewing the vilest propaganda.

7. The polarization

 The message of development is gone. BJP‚Äôs strategy for the next election is polarization and inciting pseudo-nationalism. Modi ji has basically said it himself in speeches ‚Äî Jinnah; Nehru; Congress leaders didn‚Äôt meet Bhagat Singh in jail (fake news from the PM himself!); INC leaders met leaders in Pakistan to defeat Modi in Gujarat; Yogi ji‚Äôs speech on how Maharana Pratap was greater than Akbar; JNU students are anti-national they‚Äôll #TukdeTukdeChurChur India ‚Äî this is all propaganda constructed for a very specific purpose ‚Äî polarize and win elections ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt the stuff I want to be hearing from my leaders and I refuse to follow anyone who is willing to let the nation burn in riots for political gain.

These are just some of the instances of how BJP is pushing the national discourse in a dark corner. This isn‚Äôt something I signed up for and it totally isn‚Äôt something I can support. That is why I am resigning from BJP.

PS: I supported BJP since 2013 because Narendra Modi Ji seemed like a ray of hope for India and I believed in his message of development ‚Äî that message and the hope are now both gone. The negatives of this Narendra Modi and Amit Shah government now outweigh the positives for me, but that is a decision that every voter needs to make individually. Just know that history and reality are complicated. Buying into simplistic propaganda and espousing cult-like unquestioning faith are the worst thing you can do ‚Äî it is against the interests of democracy and of this nation.

You all have your own decisions to make as the elections approach. Best of luck with that. My only hope is that we can all live and work harmoniously together ‚Äî and contribute towards making a better, stronger, poverty-free and developed India, no matter what party or ideology we support. Always remember that there are good people on both sides, the voter needs to support them and they need to support each other even when they are in different parties.

475,"I think it'll be a very difficult job if someone is still on the fence. Let's ignore everything pre 2014 and do a clean slate. Now if the past four years have done nothing to change their mind, then that means there's a combination of factors at work.

- They might not follow the news.
- They might follow the rw ecosystem, who's job it is to provide excuses and divert attention. In addition, they probably don't trust the other side to tell the **truth**. I would like to emphasize this because the word **bias** get thrown a lot. But what people mean to say is that they think the other side is **lying**.
- They're a Hindu and like the current prominence that religion has in the centre of things.
- Bit of the above and they really hate Muslims (and optionally Christians) and believe a series of popular notions about them.
- They think RaGa is an idiot.
- They follow Indian politics like I follow cricket. I basically hear people talk about it on WhatsApp and in the cafeteria.
- Anything else I might have missed. I'm sure that our friendly randians will fill the gap.

So you're really going against a lot. I'd suggest you drop it. But if you're really vested, you could perhaps bring up small things specifically and take their opinions on that. But don't do it every time something comes up, the volume of stuff would make you appear annoying. But every small bit builds up, if you do it right.

But again, I wouldn't advise it. Even if they're disenchanted, the BJP is great when it comes to the offensive. They'll easily find something that scares your friend more than Modi :D",2018-06-19 22:05:40

477,"The biggest problem is that far right ideology has mainstream appeal in India. People who see themselves as centrist or apolitical harbour pathological hatred for muslims, christians and ‚Äúthe corrupt left‚Äù or really just anybody who stands in the way of hindustan. Ethno-religious chauvinism is very very normalised in India and increasingly so.

RSS was always a far right organisation and the BJP is merely their political arm.

Unfortunately even with ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Indians, comparing the BJP, Modi or hindutva with Nazism, Hitler or Islamism is an exercise in futility, and will be dismissed via ‚ÄúGodwin‚Äôs‚Äù or some other moronic form of nitpicking.",2018-06-19 22:49:28
478,"Agreed. I don't take part in day to day politics much but i did see the living voting when left withdrew support from congress over the US nuclear deal. And everyone was with congress on that issue. But the coalition was a disaster. It's hard for congress to come back without someone as shrewed in PR game as Modi. Modi's one man ship will sink with time, but i really hope that there's an actual leader in the opposition at that time.",2018-06-19 22:54:38
479,"I am pretty anti Modi but cmon , RaGa is far from the ideal PM candidate. His only qualification is that he was born in the the Gandhi family. He has no experience in public office. Atleast Modi was CM. There are plenty of PM candidates in Congress and the sooner they realize that Raga is not one the better",2018-06-19 23:08:37

\&gt; Modi - Uneducated, Dumb, Populist Leader, has criminal reputation in the past, unaccountable/unanswerable to his subjects, authoritarian

I'm going with Robert Baratheon. 

\&gt;Amit Shah - has criminal background, corrupt, money bank, hateful, villianous

Tywin Lannister? 

\&gt; Rahul G - 'prince'/ heir of dynasty, inexperienced,  joke among the people, 

Not Jeoffrey. RG never held significant office of power, is not a tyrant. Doesn't have a thing for torture. 

\&gt; Arvind Kej - revolutionary, 'good guy' against the corrupt, targeted for persecution by 'Leader', common man

Robb Stark?

485,"The Congress ruled at a time when we had the worst global economic crisis in decades, at a time when oil went to 120+ a barrel, and **still** gave this country the highest growth rate it had ever seen.

The BJP, in an era without any global crisis and oil at an average of 60 a barrel, had to modify the GDP formula to make themselves look better and still could not match the peak growth rate under the Congress. Sure, the INC is garbage and the BJP is amazing.

People focus a lot on RaGa's gaffes, and the guy is admittedly of a soft mind. But funnily people seem to think Modi is not an equal gaffe master. Have we forgotten it+it=it? Or the ""fact"" that we had plastic surgery millenia ago? 

But all that aside, I challenge you to find an example of RaGa that's more colossaly foolish than wiping out 86% of a nation's cash because ""high denomination notes cause black money"", only to replace them with notes of *an even higher denomination*, thereby tanking the economy and failing every single stated goal including black money, fake currency, terrorism a be cashless economy.

488,"&gt; Your point is valid but it comes from a cynical viewpoint about the government.

His is not a cynical viewpoint, it is a realistic one. Parties will do what they are incentivised to do. A system where they have to answer to the people only once every 5 years is one where parties don't need to bother about people's views for four years as public memory is short. That's what only one election in 5 years incentives, because there is no upside to a party performing in Y1-3 as nobody will remember most of the things they do.


&gt; The fact that we have constant elections somewhere or the other means that political parties have to campaign continously 

That's their problem. And it's why they have several members. If GE can manufacture medical devices and aircraft equipment, you better believe parties are capable of multitasking as well.

This is really about one man though: Narendra Modi wants simultaneous elections because he's the BJPs main campaigner and it's more convenient for him to campaign once. Which is why he keeps pushing for it. 

But it's not in the best interest of the country. The thing with one election is that a slick salesman like him only has to mass-sell pipe dreams once in 5 years and can then relax. If we had a common election in 2014, BJP would have won every state as well and had absolute power for 5 years. That's far more unstable than a system that allows for constant feedback and therefore course correction throughout the 5y period. 

The current system forces him to account for his achievements every few months. And when those aren't up to the mark, he has to suffer defeat like DL or unimpressive victories like GJ. I can see why that's bad for him, but that's exactly why it's good for the country. We don't need one man to be able to gain absolute power simply by winning one election in  5 years.",2018-06-20 08:31:01
