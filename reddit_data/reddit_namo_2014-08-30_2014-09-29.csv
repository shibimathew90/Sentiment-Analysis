4,"Shit was like that in Gujarat before Modi came to Power in 2001. First thing he did after handling riots was tackling this electricity thefts.

I remember, the Electricity company officials went literally with platoons of Police in a few areas of Ahmedabad belonging to minority communities. There was state wide reward program for everyone who can report the electricity theft. A lot of villages cooperated in this movement and NaMo brought it down to virtually zero over a period of 2 years.",2014-09-01 17:54:03

Quote: India was offered a permanent seat on the council 55 years ago, in 1955. But that offer, made by the United States and the Soviet Union, was declined by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru said the seat should be given to China instead

Again, there is NO SOURCE that says this - all these ""reports"" only say that such an offer was made, but there is nothing on record or otherwise to support this. Mind you in the US documents are regularly declassified, so a document from 1955 (even if it is a memo relating to this) would have been declassified now. Even the article you linked can be used as ""evidence"" 50 years from now that ""US offered us a permanent seat"", but it is not evidence in anyway.

&gt;Wars: He didn't lose 1 war; he lost 2 (don't forget 1948, which he fucked up by going to UN).

Was the UN move a blunder? Yes, one we are paying the price for even today, but was a push into Muzzafarbad feasible? Doubtful. Please read before you mouth off - and no, Google searching does not count as reading.

&gt;Art 370: http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/article-370-the-untold-story/
BR Ambedkar refused to sign off on 370 (and Patel was opposed too), so Nehru brought in Ayyangar.

What does this even mean? Again please read a multitude of sources, please read the actual Art (which was seen as a very limited measure), again please read his negotiation with the Adivasis &amp; Nagas where he was willing to make similar concessions before you randomly say, ""Art 370 bad, hurr durr"".

First understand why this was needed, for which you need to understand the roots of the Kashmir crisis for which you need to understand the Junagadh negotiation. After all this if you still feel Art 370 at that time was a bad move, we can debate it.

&gt;Crippling the military: does 1962 ring a bell for you?

Our spending on military as a GDP ratio has always been low, we have always faced (maybe NaMo will finally fix it), a close PoL supply situation, but he hardly ""crippled"" the military. If anything under him we were well on our way to developing a Military Industrial Complex, we flew the HS 121 (Gnat) way back in the 60's, the crippling was done by Indira Gandhi. Yes again he was responsible for the defeat because he trusted Kaul &amp; Menon implicitly but did he by any yardstick ""cripple the military"" hell no. If you read Sam Maneckshaw he tells you that with preparation China could have been held and defeated (with the same military) and our big problem was lack of prepardness.",2014-09-02 10:35:13

Sanskrit is obviously inseparable from Hindu religion - such as, basic greeting ""namo namah"", essentially bowing to divinity within you, which is (if I understand) prohibited to acknowledge in Islam.

These kind of praiseworthy examples would help shed away those inhibitions and hence need limelight.",2014-09-07 22:56:51

OR, it can be interpreted as both commonly praising God. I'm pretty sure she's found a way of interpreting it in compliance with her Islam. Even if she hasn't found such an interpretation - there are alternatives. 'Suprabhatam' would do fine.

You should have taken more time and come up with an actual source. This ""source"" that you provided has no information that you said it had. It only contains the delusions of the BJP.

In addition, the website you've shared as a ""source"" has been put up by Colorbar Productions, a Gujarat-based company run by Manish Bardia. Manish Bardia also runs Moving Pixels, the company which did alot of the advertising and PR for Modi's election campaign, and has been promoting Brand NaMo for years. Apparently Modi has rewarded him by giving him a lucrative government contract to promote the statue, ie:- Modi is using taxpayer money to reward his loyalists and supporters.
