The quid pro quo is that we award lucrative contracts to American suppliers and contractors as we build nuclear power plants. In a perfect world, we would have cocked a snook at the US and purchased French and Russian technology instead. Sadly, we don't live in a perfect world. The choice is between buying American technology and remaining a nuclear pariah forever and facing an electricity crisis in the near future.

&gt; With BJP MLA Pankaja Munde, daughter of Gopinath Munde, indicating that she would not contest the bypoll to the Beed Lok Sabha constituency in Maharashtra, which fell vacant after her father's demise, the party has decided to field the late leader's other daughter Pritam for the seat.

17,"I have a fear that these polls will be a watershed moment in next 5-10 years of Indian politics. 

AAP wins - Back to the Freebie style politics. Didi, Nitish, BSP/SP will try to party with AK and I have a fear he will agree. (yes - Aap supports will downvote and question proof - but this is just a feeling a personal opinion, fear - if you might say). AK is power hungry. Sorry if you dont like it (yes. so is NaMo but the means and end-goals are different). Slowly, AK will turn ""secular"" that is my fear. Why? Because he has already morphed from ""anti-corruption"" to ""leftist/socialist"" and is already showing signs of ""caste/class-based politics"". Anything which will establish AAP as a national party will be acceptable - HECK !! he gave up Delhi just so that he could ride on the ""holier-than-thou"" wave for the Lok Sabha elections. That was the gamble he was willing to play!! Can any sane person do that? And please - if you feel that he left because of LokPal you are fooling yourself. Why else did AAP suddenly contest 432 seats( more than BJP) unless they wanted to ride that sentiment. Anyways I digress. 

BJP Wins - I am not saying that all will be great. But, according to me, the ONLY thing which matters for India at this time - is to establish itself as a manufacturing hub. Else our next generations are doomed. IT, and Call Centers will NOT feed the next generation. Already in the current job generation (10 years) are feeling the pain of stagnant salaries. 
IF Modi wins Delhi, his chances of winning Bihar, Karnataka, WB, UP go up. And that is important for him to - ensure that that Make in India is successful. Cause that will be his 2019 campaign. 


You can already imagine and feel how important this glorified municipal election is. 
Unfortunately, this is becoming a fight between highly myopic freebies such as ""free Wifi"" against the long term plans for the country.

I am not trying to justify that NaMo/Shah are some great strategists - they have miserably failed. But, frank enough - if they had done Delhi before and lost - the other 4 would have been much tougher. 
But, still They should see - what they did wrong. 
I think they got too offensive - and there was no need for that.

20,"I am from Delhi and I absolutely love my city. I am not an AAP supporter, I am not a NaMo Bhakt either, but I would vote for BJP. 

Having said that. I wish AAP all the best. They ran a superior campaign which addresses people's problems, rather than the anti-Kejriwal campaign that BJP ran which pissed me off. They behaved like Cong(I) did during 2014 LS elections. 

I wish AAP all the best. At the end of the day it's India and Indians that count. If ANY party does good for my city and my country, it has my full support. And BJP for fucks sake, please control your fringe elements. NO Hindu supports them or thinks like them. I am an atheist but my family is Hindu and they are  absolutely embarrassed by Sakshi Maharaj and Yoginath.

The mods were not this strict, we had shit tons of trolls and every troll more or less knew each other.

/r/bakchodi was born around that time. brownboy was still the mod back then.

People used to have more reasoned arguments and less name calling. Trolls were just here for the lulz with no real political or any other inclination. There was a lot more leg pulling and a lot less name calling.

Then we started seeing the shift, it started with the votes. Articles about modi started flooding. Everything on the ""new"" page with pro modi stuff in it got upvoted, every post against modi got downvoted to hell.

Then it started happening on the threads. Finally a few dedicated right wing trolls started commenting. 

This was the flood of NaMo army.

37,"&gt;This information was in the interrogation report of  Mr Headley that was given  to the Intelligence Bureau. The document was also made available to the media. But in the latter, the two paras that refer to Ishrat Jahan are missing. National Investigation Agency sources have told NDTV that Headley's comments are not legally admissible in any case other than 26/11 and his account is based on second hand information; so should be treated as 'hearsay'.

&gt;The Intelligence Bureau disagrees. It says it had inputs that the Mumbai teen and her associates were a terror unit, and in 2004, it was this information that the Gujarat branch of the Intelligence Bureau shared with the police.

NDTV claims that two paragraphs referring to Ishrat Jahan are missing in the document that was made public. Why?  NDTV is just  parroting whatever IB has told them. And then there's an ""independent"" confirmation from the FBI. Why should we trust NDTV's sources on this?
