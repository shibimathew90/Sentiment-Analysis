3,To be really frank i believe that aap is the only party who beats bjp in election. we have to accept that there is modi wave in our country. And only aap have successfully stop this wave in delhi. And in present scenario no national party i.e. congress or regional party have capability to stop modi. That's why national media give more coverage to aap and in r/india we all know that mostly here are namo bhagats so no one leave any opportunity to bash aap that's why aap is hot topic on this forum. ,2015-03-28 08:27:54

22,"&gt;He is one of the founders of the party. He invested 2cr of his money as corpus, which gave the party a start. Suppose, you are a co-founder of a company, and its business is going bad because of another founder, what would you do? 

What if the business is thriving? And the reason it is thriving is because of the other founder? Maybe he did not like the fact that his son did not have much power in the business. Don't tell me he did it because of his 'principles'. The guy who endorses the BJP and Congress does not get to talk about 'principles'.

&gt;They wont vote for PB/YoYa, even if they form a separate party. All they were doing is, seeing how the principles and dreams sold by AAP are turning into a farse and enjoying the show. The real backers for PB/YoYa are some of the AAP volunteers and leaders.

The total number of AAP backers for these traitors would not be enough to win them a single seat in the Delhi assembly. Kejriwal got us 67/70. Results talk.

&gt;&gt;'principled'

&gt;This is the damage AK has done by his quest for power and absolute control. an AAP supporter like you quoting the word principle in quotes !

The guy who supports BJP and Congress, does not get to talk about principles.

&gt;About the Tihar Jail, AK told in the NE meeting that he turned to PB whether to apply for bond or not, and PB nodded to him not to. AK will even go to singsing if he thinks that it will fetch him some votes.(mark of a true politician, and these days its difficult to find such commitment to politics/power  from other leaders)

BJP supporters are quite willing to take PB blindly at his word. While questioning anything AK says. Says a lot about whose loyalties still lie with the AAP. If PB/YY are willing to take a shit on the efforts and sacrifices of all the AAP volunteers to further their quest for power, maybe they are better off joining the BJP.

&gt;Fucking slimy asshole

&gt;This hole fought for 2G/Common cause/PILs...so dismissing him as such is unwarranted.

Good. But that doesn't give you a license to take a shit on the efforts and hard work of millions of volunteers who have worked selflessly for the party. The fact that the NaMo army have suddenly become such big fans of YY/PB is proof enough that the AAP is better off without such traitors.",2015-04-03 22:57:39

I don't think so. They are a little too power hungry for that.

36,"&gt; 'Hindutva' agenda!

It doesn't have Hindutva tinge to it the way I see it, I'm as much of a non-Hindu as one could be but offering asylum to persecuted minorities is how I see it. And in this case, the usual counter argument is ""What about Shias?"", well they aren't a minority and they willingly moved as they wanted to be in a separate country. I feel /r/india likes to view India and Pakistan as to entirely separate countries with no history instead of looking at the various aspects of partition, it will always have religion in its issues, that's the whole god damn fountain of Pakistan's existence.

&gt; It makes the Hindu/Muslim divide more, much more.

Why and how? And where? In India or Pakistan? If latter, it couldn't be bigger. [Read] (https://www.quora.com/Living-in-Pakistan/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-a-Pakistani-Hindu)

Why would Indian Muslims object? I'm genuinely asking, I don't see a reason for them to object. If India gives asylum to Hindus from Pakistan, it doesn't mean ""India is only for Hindus"", it simply means those respective countries are not for them. 

&gt; We are not a religious state, we should stop discrimination on basis of religion.

Wat, so you are implying if we're to give asylum to Hindus in Pakistan we should also give ""asylum"" to those who left on their own will? Most Hindus in Pakistan are there because of geographical and many other reasons, it's like people don't even know partition ever happened or why it happened. It wasn't a separation of a culture/region that wanted independence.

&gt; In the riots which preceded the partition in the Punjab region, between 200,000 to 500,000 people were killed in the retributive genocide. **UNHCR estimates 14 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were displaced during the partition; it was the largest mass migration in human history.**

.

&gt; Minority groups. Do Muhajirs are also considered as minority group? Would they be allowed for LTV?

Are they persecuted? It isn't just offering asylum to ""minorities"" you know. Read the quora page I linked above ^

On the Wiki page of Muhajir people, there's no search results for ""persecution"". 

&gt; There were 8.8 million Hindus in Pakistan in 1951. In 1951, Hindus constituted 22% of the Pakistani population (including present-day Bangladesh); Today, the Hindu minority amounts to 1.7 percent of Pakistan's population. **Hindu minorities living under the influence of the Taliban in Swat, Pakistan, were forced to wear red headgear such as turbans as a symbol of dhimmi.** In July 2010, around 60 members of the minority Hindus in Karachi were attacked and ethnically cleansed following an incident when a Hindu youth drank from a water tap near an Islamic mosque. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan came out with a report in 2010 stating that at least 25 Hindu girls are abducted in Pakistan every month. In January 2014, in an attack on a temple, the guard was gunned down. [Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#Pakistan)

&gt; Be secular and do secular, NaMo seems to be starting this nonsensical religious shit all over again...but slowly and steadily.

Sigh. Humanitarian principles are the grounds for this, not religious. 

&gt; The online application system will help Pakistani nationals belonging to minority community, particularly Hindus and Sikhs, **who seek refuge in India for fear of religious persecution back home.**

And tbh I would extend the principle of giving asylum to all kind of persecuted minorities from neighboring countries if it weren't for the welfare state.",2015-04-24 07:17:34
