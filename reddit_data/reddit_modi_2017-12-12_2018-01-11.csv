**Congress entrapped in blue whale game, final episode on December 18: PM Narendra Modi** 

 ______ 
Rahul Gandhi was born with a ‚Äúgolden spoon‚Äù and has not seen poverty, said PM Narendra Modi Rahul Gandhi was born with a ‚Äúgolden spoon‚Äù and has not seen poverty, said PM Narendra Modi

The Congress is ‚Äúentrapped‚Äù in ‚ÄòBlue Whale‚Äô challenge and will see the final episode on December 18, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today, invoking the dangerous online game which culminates in the player committing suicide, to attack the opposition party. Addressing a rally here in northern Gujarat on the penultimate day of campaigning for the second and final phase of Assembly polls, Modi targeted Congress‚Äôs president-elect Rahul Gandhi, saying he was born with a ‚Äúgolden spoon‚Äù and has not seen poverty.

He also rejected allegations levelled by Rahul Gandhi that he works only for a few industrialists, and accused him of spreading ‚Äúfalsehood and half-truths‚Äù about Gujarat and trying to ‚Äúfool and insult‚Äù the intelligence of the people of the state. ‚ÄúWhen there are indications that the BJP has emerged victorious in the first round (of voting held on December 9), Congressmen are busy trying to find ways to defend Rahul Gandhi. One hour after the start of voting, senior leaders started shouting EVM‚Ä¶EVM‚Ä¶EVM..EVM.

One senior leader, he said, even claimed that an EVM was hacked by connecting it to bluetooth. ‚ÄúThey do not understand that the EVM is a standalone machine, it has no Internet, it cannot get connected to blue tooth. Can you connect your pen to a bluetooth?‚Äù Modi asked the crowd.

‚ÄúThey are shouting bluetooth, bluetooth (a low-power wireless connectivity technology), but actually they are entrapped in Blue Whale game and the final episode of the game will be played on December 18,‚Äù Modi said. Counting of votes for the keenly contested Gujarat election is scheduled for December 18.

Blue Whale is a mobile game in which participants are instructed to complete a range of challenges ‚Äì the final of which is committing suicide. According to reports, a large number of young people who played the game have ended their lives. Modi alleged Gandhi has been levelling false allegations against him.

‚ÄúThis Congress leader, on whose shoulders the entire responsibility of the party has come, has been alleging day and night that Modi works for five top industrialists of the country. ‚ÄúYou have seen me working here as chief minister for 13-14 years, I have grown up before your eyes. Have I ever worked for a few industrialists?‚Äù Modi asked the crowd which responded with an emphatic ‚Äúno‚Äù.

The prime minister asked his audience to exact ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù from those levelling such ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù allegations, and went on the list development works done by him for the poor of the country. He said as the Gujarat chief minister he used to conduct ‚Äòshala praveshoutsav‚Äô (school enrolment drive) as part of which he would to go to villages every year to ensure 100 per cent enrolment.

‚ÄúWas this work for Ambani or for the poor children of the state? I used to conduct ‚Äòkrushi mahotsav‚Äô every year in which the entire government machinery, including the chief minister, used to go to villages to guide farmers on latest technology. Was this for Ambani-Adani, Tata-Birla or for the poor farmers of the country?‚Äù Modi claimed Rahul Gandhi and the Congress were spreading ‚Äúlies‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe have problem with this blatant lie that has been spread by the Congress. You have not seen what is poverty. You do not know the pain one feels when you are walking barefoot and stone pierces your feet. You were born with a golden spoon,‚Äù he said. Gandhi has been alleging that Modi works just for 5-10 top industrialists of the country.

‚ÄúOur problem is, by repeating the same falsehood for over two months, you are underestimating the intelligence of the people of Gujarat. ‚ÄúYou are trying to fool people. You are insulting the people of this state,‚Äù Modi said, adding voters are not fools and it will show in the election results. The second and final phase of polling in 93 Assembly seats will be held on December 14.

You're portraying Modi as a mass murderer for something that was initiated by a community and given a clean chit by the SC. The ruling government + neighbouring states refused to provide police reinforcements and played communal politics. I have personally interacted with police constables who have travelled the whole of North India and confessed that Gujarat is the most peaceful state with the police forces having an upper hand on any mischiefs. Their daily wages were shoddy af which changed only after Modi became the CM.

We all know how the Congress government sat silent while the kaffir Pandits were driven out of Kashmir. 

Look at the riot history of Gujarat before and after Modi. My parents said that before he came to power, curfews were a regular thing in Ahmedabad. Why is it that Ahmedabad is one of the most safest cities to live in India, where sisters and mothers alike roam freely till late even after midnight?

**In Jaipur Class X, English passage on PM Modi fails spelling test** 

 ______ 
Students in an exam hall. (Express Photo/Representational) Students in an exam hall. (Express Photo/Representational)

‚ÄúMODI SERVED as the Chief Minister of Gujrat for the four terms‚Ä¶ As a spoker he is known as a craod-puller. He is the most sovy political leader of India.‚Äù How many spelling mistakes are there in these two sentences?

Unfortunately, that was not the question asked of Class X students appearing for their half-yearly English exam in government schools in Jaipur under the Rajasthan Board for Secondary Education (RBSE). The mistakes ‚Äî there were many more ‚Äî were in the question itself. And they have left education officials in Rajasthan red-faced.

Covering Modi‚Äôs life in brief, the passage says, ‚ÄúHe used to help his father in selling tea‚Äù, and that his swearing-in was a ‚Äúfirst of its kind‚Äù as he ‚Äúinvited all SAARC leaders‚Äù. It also refers to Modi joining the RSS at the age of eight and leaving home at 17. ‚ÄúHe became RSS Pracharak,‚Äù states the next line. It describes Modi as a ‚Äúvegetarian‚Äù, a ‚Äúworkaholic‚Äù and an ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù who ‚Äúwrites poems but in Gujrati‚Äù.

Some of the questions that followed this passage were no different in style and substance: ‚ÄúHow can you say that he is a poet?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy was his swearing in ceremony first of his kind?‚Äù

The next passage ‚Äî on a ‚Äúlittle boy‚Äù ‚Äî was followed by this question: ‚ÄúWhat kind of the boy was?‚Äù

The question paper, with 70 marks, was also riddled with spelling mistakes: obese was ‚Äúobessed‚Äù, violence was ‚Äúvoilence‚Äù.

The passage from the question paper The passage from the question paper

When contacted, RBSE chairman B L Chaudhary said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt conduct the half-yearly examination. It is conducted independently by district education authorities.‚Äù

Jaipur District Education Officer Ratan Singh Yadav said, ‚ÄúI will get this examined by our expert committee‚Ä¶ Usually, there are printing errors, but there seem to be many in this case. The children should not suffer. We have provisions for bonus marks if a question is incorrect.‚Äù

The Opposition Congress, meanwhile, highlighted the passage on the Prime Minister and accused the education department of having become a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù for BJP propaganda. Congress state president Sachin Pilot alleged that the ‚Äúrevision‚Äù of school curriculum was an attempt by the BJP government to influence youth through ‚Äúblatant promotion‚Äù of its ideology.

Denying the allegation, district official Yadav said, ‚ÄúIf something has been asked out of syllabus, we will get it examined by experts‚Ä¶ teachers and officials enrolled with the department prepared the question paper and their identity is confidential.‚Äù

A government school principal in Jaipur, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall seeing so many errors in a question paper.‚Äù

Last month, Jaipur education officials had asked government and private schools in the city to take their students to a Hindu spiritual and service fair, where books and pamphlets on ‚ÄúLove Jihad‚Äù, ‚ÄúChristian conspiracies‚Äù, etc. were distributed and sold.

PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs none-too-veiled innuendo in an election speech in Banaskantha district on Sunday has severely let down his constitutional commitment and office PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs none-too-veiled innuendo in an election speech in Banaskantha district on Sunday has severely let down his constitutional commitment and office

If politics in a mature constitutional democracy is also about the unwritten rules of the game, if it includes a reciprocal pact between players to acknowledge and uphold dignity, their own and their opponent‚Äôs, then this is a disquieting day. PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs none-too-veiled innuendo in an election speech in Banaskantha district on Sunday has severely let down his constitutional commitment and office. A day after the first phase of polling in Gujarat, he spoke about a former Pakistani army officer allegedly showing undue interest in the election and supporting Ahmed Patel for chief minister. And about a dinner meeting at Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs home, where Indian dignitaries, including a former PM, vice-president and army chief, met with a Pakistani delegation, including the Pak high commissioner, to hold secret talks in the midst of Gujarat polls. The import of the PM‚Äôs statements was inescapable and grim: Speaking in the same breath of the Congress, Pakistan and a Muslim candidate for CM, he suggested that they are partners in an unholy, rather anti-national, conspiracy. In one stroke, he labelled his political opponent as unpatriotic and lent the immense weight of his office to a shameful politics of stereotyping that holds all of India‚Äôs Muslims to be pro-Pakistan and guilty.

Whether the BJP wins the Gujarat election, or loses it, the PM‚Äôs day out in Banaskantha should bring a moment of reflection and pause. So far, over the last three years or so of the Modi regime, whenever unseemly and outright bigoted statements were made that cast the Muslim as the Other, the Anti-National, and the Enemy, the PM‚Äôs office was singed. And yet, it maintained a modicum of distance and deniability. It was the fringe, it could be said, and in any case, these were sporadic excesses that a large party like the BJP couldn‚Äôt possibly control. On Hindus and Muslims, in the Lok Sabha campaign on the eve of the 2014 polls in Bihar, Candidate Modi had struck a high note. Muslims and Hindus must not fight each other, he said, but together battle poverty. When he repeated that statement as PM during another Bihar campaign, this time for the state assembly, not even his party president Amit Shah‚Äôs incendiary remark, that firecrackers would be burst in Pakistan should the BJP lose, could fully extinguish the distinction between the PM and the Rest.

Now, the PM‚Äôs statements at Banaskantha imperil that distinction. Several of Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs guests, including and especially former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, have denied PM Modi‚Äôs version of the dinner party. Gujarat was not on the menu, they have said. The Modi government has sought to challenge their response, but the damage is done. It travels far and runs deep. Next time there is a hate crime, the next time a Shambhulal Regar counts on state protection and impunity, the silence of the PM can ‚Äî and should ‚Äî be interrogated more loudly.

**Congress Trapped In Blue Whale Game, Final Episode On December 18: PM Modi** 

 ______ 
PM Modi addressed a rally in northern Gujarat on the second last day of poll
campaigning

**Patan, Gujarat: **

The Congress is ""entrapped"" in a 'Blue Whale' challenge and will see the final
episode on December 18, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, invoking
the online game which culminates in the player committing suicide, to attack
the opposition party. Addressing a rally in northern Gujarat on the second
last day of campaigning for the final phase of Assembly elections, PM Modi
targeted Congress's president-elect Rahul Gandhi, saying he was born with a
""golden spoon"" and has not seen poverty.

He also rejected allegations levelled by Rahul Gandhi that he works only for a
few industrialists, and accused him of spreading ""falsehood and half-truths""
about Gujarat and trying to ""fool and insult"" the intelligence of the people
of the state.

""When there are indications that the BJP has emerged victorious in the first
round (of voting held on December 9), Congressmen are busy trying to find ways
to defend Rahul Gandhi. One hour after the start of voting, senior leaders
started shouting EVM...EVM...EVM...EVM,"" he said.

One senior leader, he said, even claimed that an EVM was hacked by connecting
it to a Bluetooth device.

""They do not understand that the EVM is a standalone machine, it has no
Internet, it cannot get connected to Bluetooth. Can you connect your pen to a
Bluetooth?"" PM Modi asked the crowd.

""They are shouting Bluetooth, Bluetooth, but actually they are entrapped in
Blue Whale game and the final episode of the game will be played on December
18,"" PM Modi said.

Counting of votes for the keenly contested Gujarat election is scheduled for
December 18.

The Blue Whale is a mobile game in which participants are instructed to
complete a range of challenges - the final of which is committing suicide. The
game shot to headlines earlier this year after a number of teenagers and
children who played the game were found dead.

**Why is PM Narendra Modi obsessed with Muslims?** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Source: File photo/REUTERS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Source: File photo/REUTERS)

As the high-voltage Gujarat election campaign winds down, Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs comments on the Indian Muslim-Pakistan Muslim continuum is not only having a deeply divisive effect inside the country, it is also poisoning the waters beyond India‚Äôs borders.

The Pakistan foreign office, in a statement on Monday morning said, ‚ÄúIndia should stop dragging Pakistan into its electoral debate and win victories on own strength rather than fabricated conspiracies, which are utterly baseless and irresponsible.‚Äù

Question is, why did the PM, in his speech in Palanpur, Gujarat, on Sunday drag former prime minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs name into the contentious argument in which he named both former vice-president Hamid Ansari as well as Pakistan high commissioner Sohail Mehmood, who were present last week at a dinner meeting organized by suspended Congressman Mani Shankar Aiyar?

The guest list at Aiyar‚Äôs dinner was pretty secular, and included former external affairs minister K Natwar Singh, as well as several former high commissioners to Pakistan such as Satinder K Lambah, Sharad Sabharwal, TCA Raghavan as well as a former army chief Deepak Kapoor. READ | At Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs dinner: Former army chief, ex-diplomats

So why did the PM pick on only the obvious Muslim names like Hamid Ansari and Sohail Mehmood ‚Äì besides Dr Manmohan Singh, of course ‚Äì in his Palanpur speech?

He also targetted an alleged comment by a Pakistani general saying Congress leader Ahmed Patel should be made the chief minister of Gujarat, by asking whether Pakistan was now going to influence an Indian election.

As the election campaign has become shriller and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has perceptibly taken the high moral ground, Modi‚Äôs speeches seem to have increasingly focused on anti-Muslim rhetoric. Even RSS leaders are beginning to wonder if the election, that too in BJP‚Äôs favourite home state Gujarat, is becoming so tight that the PM is being forced to add to the vitriol.

Dragging Pakistan high commissioner Sohail Mehmood through this high-voltage rhetoric is decidedly odd, especially as Mehmood‚Äôs presence on Indian territory is legitimized since he presented his credentials to President Ram Nath Kovind in August, the BJP‚Äôs own candidate.

So does the PM‚Äôs attack on the Pakistan high commissioner now mean that he has doubts about the credentials ceremony of his own government, a sacrosanct event that draws its strength from the Geneva/Vienna convention?

The PM‚Äôs attack on Aiyar, a day after Aiyar accused the PM of being a ‚Äúneech kisam ka aadmi hai,‚Äù a man of low intellectual thought, was equally astounding.

‚ÄúCongress leaders are speaking in a language that is not acceptable in a democracy‚Ä¶This is insulting. This is nothing but a mindset of the Mughals,‚Äù the PM said.

Whatever did he mean by conflating the long-departed Mughals ‚Äì who, at the height of their empire, employed Hindu generals to fight their battles against other Hindu kings ‚Äî with a throwaway remark by Aiyar, at best unbecoming of a diplomat-turned-politician ?

Only two days ago, Modi accused Congressman Salman Nizami of saying that he wants ‚ÄúAzaad Kashmir,‚Äù as well as made uncalled for remarks against the PM, asking ‚Äúwhose son is he?‚Äù As the Congress went into damage control mode ‚Äì just like it had done with Mani Shankar Aiyar two days before, by suspending him ‚Äì now saying Nizami was not a Congress worker, the former Kashmiri journalist from Banihal denied he had said anything anti-national.

Nizami wanted to know why the PM was picking on him in the first place. ‚ÄúI am a nobody, I joined the Congress only three years ago,‚Äù he said.

From targeting the Congress‚Äô ‚ÄúMughal mindset‚Äù to picking on Salman Nizami The Nobody, to attacking Hamid Ansari to disparaging the Pakistan high commissioner, the prime minister seems to have made the short leap from Indian Muslims to Pakistani Muslims. It is as if the partition of India in 1947, only 70 years ago, is still such a burning issue that needs to be constantly addressed by the prime minister.

With the winter session of Parliament only a couple of days old when the results for the Gujarat election come in, will the prime minister be able to put aside the vitriol and work with the Congress party on Bills that demand the attention of the Opposition as well? Will he be able to lead with skill and panache India‚Äôs difficult policy with Pakistan, having torn up the Pakistan high commissioner‚Äôs presence on Indian soil ?

Sources point out that Modi‚Äôs obsession with Pakistan manifests in several ways ‚Äì including critical comments he made to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his recent trip to India. But the Americans, or any other country, will do what is in their national interest, not in India‚Äôs ‚Äì that is the first lesson of politics.

The second lesson is that the PM is the prime minister of the entire country, not just the BJP. All state election campaigns will come to an end, sooner than later. Then the country will beckon.

Cut to 2017, the truth is now that the PR team is gone Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani etc. are suddenly in the limelight. These issues were not new it's just that these are things that current leadership in Gujarat is unable to manage. Saurasthra Patel's have been a discontented lot for a pretty long time. Even in the last election Keshubhai Patel was hoping to leverage this discontent and win elections but the way he had planned it was a joke. 

No to mention, during the Patidar agitation the violent backlash by the Police didn't go down well too. Policemen literally went inside areas thrashing people and breaking properties and I am talking about places which had no connection with the Patidar agitation. 

There are clearly many fault lines this time around. Patidars, Dalits and the minority community was never pro-BJP. Now it depends how this vote share of dissenting communities breaks off and goes to whom. 

Things are really tense. This is probably the first time I am seeing resorting back to the Pak-bashing narrative in Gujarat election campaigns. Last time when I heard it, that was after 2002 Godhra riots, when he used Mia Musharraf time and again in campaigns.

**Raja Mandala: Indian diplomacy, beyond the canon** 

 ______ 
India has no reason to abandon its engagement with Russia and China. India is certainly eager to expand the sphere of cooperation with Russia and China and limit many of the divergences. (Photo: AP) India has no reason to abandon its engagement with Russia and China. India is certainly eager to expand the sphere of cooperation with Russia and China and limit many of the divergences. (Photo: AP)

India‚Äôs intensive diplomatic engagements this week help us better frame Delhi‚Äôs unfolding multi-directional foreign policy. That India can sit with the US and its allies one day and hold consultations with the Russians and Chinese the next is certainly disconcerting to the traditionalists in Delhi. But South Block sees the new approach as reflecting a definitive pragmatism rooted in the rise of India and the emergence of multipolar world.

But first to Delhi‚Äôs diplomatic calendar this week. It began with the conclusion of ‚ÄúBodhi Parva‚Äù ‚Äî a celebration of Buddhist heritage to mark the 20th anniversary of a Bay of Bengal Forum, inelegantly called the BIMSTEC. It brings together five South Asian nations (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka) and two South East Asian nations (Burma and Thailand). India‚Äôs current eastward orientation is also highlighted by a second event in Delhi this week ‚Äî a conference on connecting India and the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

If cultural, digital and physical connectivity have become important themes in Indian diplomacy these days, so has the idea of minilateralism with multiple partners. Delhi‚Äôs support for the renewal of the quadrilateral security dialogue last month marked its emphasis on ad hoc and flexible arrangements to pursue India‚Äôs interests in a more complex world.

Delhi is hosting the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers this week as part of a continuing trilateral engagement over the last decade and a half. It then holds another trilateral forum with Japan and Australia this week. Top diplomats from Delhi, Tokyo and Canberra have been meeting regularly over the last three years. This supplements the quadrilateral dialogue as well as the on-going trilateral engagement with the US and Japan. Delhi is also holding the first-ever ‚Äútwo plus two‚Äù dialogue with Australia in which the foreign and defence secretaries from the two countries sit together.

To add some additional spice into this mix, Delhi is welcoming the Secretary General of the Commonwealth, Baroness Patricia Scotland, this week. This follows the visit to Delhi last month by Prince Charles, when the two sides agreed to consider the prospects for India playing a larger role in the Commonwealth.

The revival of the quad certainly raised political eyebrows in Delhi and beyond. Some worry about India‚Äôs commitment to non-alignment and presume an irreversible tilt towards the US. Delhi, by no means is defensive. It points to the Chinese effort to construct a ‚Äúnew type of great power relations‚Äù with the United States, Beijing‚Äôs quadrilateral dialogue with the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Russia‚Äôs interest in a grand bargain with America under President Donald Trump. Delhi has no reason to abandon its engagement with Russia and China. India is certainly eager to expand the sphere of cooperation with Russia and China and limit many of the divergences.

For the conservatives in the foreign policy community, India‚Äôs seemingly polyamorous engagements are quite incomprehensible. Whether we agree with the government or not, it is quite evident that Delhi is no longer bound to the inherited diplomatic canon. Unlike the ideologues wedded to the worldview from a different era, realists in Delhi emphasise the need to continuously adapt. They point to the breakdown of the post Cold War world order dominated by the United States amidst the Russian and Chinese assertiveness in Europe and Asia and India‚Äôs need to secure its interests in an increasingly uncertain world.

Pragmatism has indeed been a compelling imperative after the Cold War came to an end. Many of the current initiatives, the opening to the West in general and the United States in particular, the trilateral engagement with Russia and China and the quadrilateral security dialogue were all initiated and advanced by the governments led by P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh.

The contribution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in bringing greater energy to these initiatives and discarding some of the past political inhibitions. Pragmatism after the Cold War has meant that Delhi looked beyond the Non-Aligned Movement. Today it is part of such diverse organisations like the G-20, East Asia Summit, BRICS, and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Having ignored the Commonwealth all these decades, Delhi is now looking more positively at the forum that brings more than 50 members together. It is a potential arena for Indian leadership.

Meanwhile, the rise of India is changing Delhi‚Äôs location in the structure of global power. This, in turn, alters the trajectory of India‚Äôs great power relations. In the past, Delhi‚Äôs main purpose was to prevent great power competition from constraining newly sovereign India‚Äôs room for manoeuvre on the global stage. Today as one of the world‚Äôs top economies with growing military potential, India is in a position to shape the great power politics and influence the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific and Eurasia.

Finally, India‚Äôs wish for a multipolar world has been granted. A multipolar world is far more unstable than a world that is dominated by single power or structured around a duopoly. As the weakest among the major powers in the unfolding multipolar world, Delhi needs to advance in all directions and engage more actively with a variety of minilateral and multilateral forums.

**The strongest Opposition voice in the country: Why ‚Äòsilent‚Äô Manmohan Singh worries the BJP** 

 ______ 
Former PM Manmohan Singh‚Äôs attack triggered a series of reactions from the BJP including senior ministers like Union Ministers Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad. (source: AP) Former PM Manmohan Singh‚Äôs attack triggered a series of reactions from the BJP including senior ministers like Union Ministers Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad. (source: AP)

It‚Äôs an irony that the man who was ridiculed for his silence, the man who was accused of being weak has now become the Opposition‚Äôs strongest voice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The `Accidental Prime Minister‚Äô has proved the power of his silence by speaking out aggressively ‚Äì in his own carefully chosen words ‚Äì against the policies of the BJP government.

Each time Dr Manmohan Singh has spoken, the BJP appears rattled. Everyone from the PM and Finance Minister downwards has come out to counter him. The BJP and its top leaders ridiculed him at every opportunity they got during his tenure as prime minister ‚Äì they called him the weakest PM, ham-handed, a puppet and disparaged him as ‚Äúnikamma‚Äù. However, in May 2015, when Prime Minister Modi invited him for a discussion on the economy and foreign policy, Singh earned the respect of BJP watchers as well as its cadre. Modi was considered a complete contrast to Manmohan Singh. Modi is seen as a strong and articulate leader, qualities Singh has yet to display. But today, Singh stands tall ‚Äî as he predicted, history is already kinder to him than the media was during his tenure.

On Monday, Singh shocked the BJP with an unusually combative response to the PM‚Äôs accusation of the Congress conspiring with Pakistan in the Gujarat elections at dinner organised by Mani Shankar Aiyar. He strongly criticised Modi for the ‚Äúfalsehood and canards being spread to score political points‚Äù and sought nothing less than an apology from him.

The strongly-worded statement was political too. ‚ÄúFearing imminent defeat in Gujarat, desperation of Prime Minister to hurl every abuse and latch on to every straw is palpable,‚Äù his statement said. These words surprised even his party colleagues. Sources in the Congress said that when the PM first made the allegation, Singh was reluctant to go public and left it to the party to react. However, with the BJP mounting attack on him, Singh changed his mind and broke his silence.

Singh‚Äôs attack triggered a series of reactions from the BJP including senior ministers like Union Ministers Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad. Former Army Chief Deepak Kapoor who attended the dinner clarified to The Indian Express that it was just a private dinner and conversation concerned only Indo-Pak relations. However, Jaitley described it as a ‚Äúmisadventure.‚Äù He then invoked Sharm-el-Sheikh, alleging that Singh had indulged in a ‚Äúsimilar misadventure‚Äù in 2009 when he allowed a joint statement after a bilateral meeting between him and his Pakistan counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani, to mention Balochistan in it.

Yesterday, Manmohan Singh‚Äôs statement seemed to have achieved its objective. More of those who attended the meeting came out to clarify that it was a usual track-II diplomatic meeting. Many in the BJP admitted privately that the PM should not have made such an allegation about a meeting which was attended by former diplomats and a former Army Chief.

Singh has rarely made public interventions in the last three years since the BJP came to power but whenever he has spoken, it has weighed too heavily for the BJP to ignore. In November 2016, Dr Singh termed Modi‚Äôs demonetization as ‚Äúmonumental disaster‚Äù. He, uncharacteristically, lashed out at the government and its decision, calling it ‚Äúorganised loot and legalized plunder‚Äù adding that the ‚Äò50-days‚Äô were like a torture that could have a disastrous effect on the poor and the deprived. He said the decision could lead to GDP declining by two percentage points, which he said would be ‚Äúan underestimate and not an overestimate.‚Äù

Immediately, Jaitley countered. However, instead of speaking as Finance Minister, Jaitley reacted politically and reminded Singh of the loot under his regime in the 2G scam, the CWG scam and the irregularities in allocation of coal blocks. He asserted: ‚ÄúAn anti-black money drive is (an) ethical drive, a moral step. And what is morally and ethically correct has to be politically correct.‚Äù But the damage was done. Singh‚Äôs reputation as an economist made his words credible.

Modi took Singh‚Äôs attack seriously. He criticised him for his ‚Äúsilence‚Äù on scams during his tenure and referred to him as someone adept at bathing with a raincoat on. Modi said: ‚ÄúThere is not a single black mark against him despite all the corruption. Only Doctor Saab knows how to bathe with a raincoat in the bathroom.‚Äù (Bathroom me raincoat pehen kar nahana‚Ä¶Yeh kala to doctor sahab hi jante hain, aur koi nahin janta).

Singh‚Äôs intervention during the passage of the GST bill in the Rajya Sabha, earned him the respect of the Treasury benches. While the Congress wanted to make the passage of the bill tougher for the BJP in the Upper House where it had the numbers to stall it, Singh intervened and asked his party not to seek changes in them to ‚Äúmaintain consensus and federal agreement.‚Äù

The same Singh came down heavily on the ruling party over the implementation of GST. Addressing a gathering of businesspersons and traders in Ahmedabad last month, he said the policy has broken the back of small businesses in the country. ‚ÄúWhen undertaking the endeavour of one nation one tax if PM Modi had taken inspiration from the resolve of the great Sardar Patel, the outcome would have been different,‚Äù he said.

He ridiculed BJP‚Äôs ambitious bullet train project too, dubbing it as ‚Äúan exercise in vanity.‚Äù Reiterating his criticism of the note ban, he said it was a ‚Äúhalf baked crusade against black money.‚Äù

It was evident that no one in the Opposition can hurt the ruling party as much as Singh can. Many, including a section in the BJP, believe that Singh was right in his criticism of demonetisation. That‚Äôs why BJP is always worried when Dr Manmohan Singh gets angry.

Nobody is talking about development. And that means that in order to shore up the few areas where BJP is losing votes, Modi needs to get into that muck of identity politics himself.

Whether it is 15 incidents or 50. It is to spread the fear that it can happen at any moment, anywhere. (Express) Whether it is 15 incidents or 50. It is to spread the fear that it can happen at any moment, anywhere. (Express)

Junaid Khan, Mohammad Akhlaq, Pehlu Khan, Zahid Rasool Bhat, Abu Hanifa, Riazuddin Ali, Zafar Hussain, Ayub Pandit. the list can go on, will tragically go on, in a republic whose only near certain headline these days is a lynching. The protests will come, hesitant and muted. But even the tag line of the protest, ‚ÄúNot In My Name‚Äù, will, unconsciously, betray a sense of numb helplessness. All we can do is distance ourselves, deny our culpability. But whether we can prevent this atrocity from being repeated is another matter. A monstrous new moral order is unfolding, irrigated by the blood of our citizens. But this monstrosity is also wickedly clever. It is unfolding slowly, picking on individual victims, manifesting through a thousand cuts, rather than through a big cataclysm.

A big riot would concentrate the mind, make a damning headline. A protracted riot in slow motion, individual victims across different states, simply makes this appear another daily routine. This makes opposing it harder; it makes holding onto the outrage nearly impossible. We can keep repeating our outrage till our words are exhausted; each expression of outrage loses its power simply by being made to be repeated over and over. What began as a loud voice over Akhlaq is now a fading echo over Junaid. It is evil telling language: ‚ÄúI am more inexhaustible than you.‚Äù Every repetition of condemnation seems to diminish its power. After Dadri, the critics are made to sound like broken records, each protest less effective than another. Meanwhile, every act of violence emboldens another.

But if evil is already patiently wearing down protest, there is a deeper reason why this kind of violence represents a new benchmark in Indian politics. There are, of course, the usual defence mechanisms to deny the gravity of this violence. It is an irony that in an age defined by hype, the only hype that is condemned is one that tries to bring this violence to the centre of our attention. Pointing out that violence has happened before, in other political regimes, that it is an endemic part of the way vulnerable groups, Dalits, Adivasis, increasingly minorities, are put in their place is also no longer an enabling moral insight. Instead of using this history to behove us to take this violence seriously, we use it simply as a way of deflecting attention.

The sins of the past become the perfect excuse for destroying the moral community of the future. The third mechanism is to quarter justice into partisan hues till it disappears from sight. Since X did not condemn violence against Y, their protest on violence against Z must be in bad faith. This argument itself now has become a weapon of psychic warfare to disable any confronting of violence. It is often not even a true description of people‚Äôs position, but more a tool to shut them down. Indeed, it is a strange corrosion of the moral order which is focussed on condemnation of each and every act of evil individually; no citizen can possibly deal with every single act of evil in this country. It deflects attention from the underlying institutions and moral principles at work.

These lynchings are fiendishly redefining citizenship. The significance of this violence is not just the number: Whether it is 15 incidents or 50. It is to spread the fear that it can happen at any moment, anywhere. This violence establishes a new political dispensation, where a group of people claim direct sovereignty: They act above formal law and order institutions, they feel entitled to enforce the morality, and their impunity comes from the fact that they can now stand in for the ‚Äúauthentic people.‚Äù Although the violence is different in many respects, there is this commonality in those who lynch in the name of cows and those lynching in the name of azadi in Kashmir. Since I speak in the name of the authentic Hindu or the authentic Kashmiri, my violence now has this imprimatur of what I take to be a people‚Äôs sovereignty.

The formal institutions of the state will not condemn this violence, or condemn it in half-hearted abstractions, because they have unleashed this politics. When the nation can speak unmediated, if a single leader, or a news anchor can be a stand-in for the nation, each violent citizen will also be emboldened to take on the same role. When the nation is the highest unmediated value, is it any surprise that anything being done in its name becomes higher than law? When every political leader, most television stations, daily peddle the poisonous binary of authentic and non-authentic Indians, is it any surprise that the gau rakshaks, through their act of violence, declare themselves to be defenders of the authentic Indian, as they see it?

Let us make no mistake about this. There will be a lot of mendacious evasions. It will be said that this violence is not over beef. It has to do with some other disputes. Lynchings and vigilante violence have happened before, even under Congress rule. Violence happens across political regimes. But its placement in a normative order also matters. These obvious facts cannot take away one large feature of the current wave. What makes this violence chilling is not what‚Äôs in the statistic. It is that it is acquiring an atmosphere of a religious communion about it. It is violence to establish the power of the majority, and to redefine that majority as a political dispensation sees fit. This violence is now united by one single thread, of showing minorities their place. All of us are innocent till proven guilty; minorities, whether on a train, driving a truck, transporting cattle, distributing sweets, are guilty until proven innocent. This violence seeks to alter the fundamental moral and constitutional order: The victim of the lynching is presented as the criminal, while the ideologies that justify this killing enjoy the patronage of the state. This is what makes it induce so much fear. A fear exacerbated by the fact that our public conscience seems to have been all but dismantled.

The metaphysical invocation of India‚Äôs diversity, or the examples of personal virtue here and there, should not blind us to the core ideological, institutional and human rights problem this new wave of lynching represents. Narendra Modi may loudly proclaim that he is defending our borders. But his cowardly silences, or abstract gestures, are emboldening the barbarians within. What political dispensation will be able to prevent this list from Akhlaq to Ayub from growing is an open question. But at least we should say, ‚ÄúMay the silent be damned.‚Äù

**""Will Make 1+ 1 = 11,"" PM Narendra Modi Promises Gujarat As Campaigning Ends** 

 ______ 
Gujarat Assembly Election 2017: PM Modi took a seaplane to a temple in
Mehsana.

**Ahmedabad: **

After his road show was cancelled today,

Prime Minister Narendra Modi took off from the Sabarmati river on a seaplane
to Mehsana

, where he offered prayers at a temple, before flying back to Ahmedabad. He
stood on the footboard of the plane as it took off waving to the crowds that
stood cheering on the banks of the river. After de-boarding, he stood on the
footboard of an SUV and waved to people.

After addressing over 25 rallies in the last 15 days, on the last day of
campaigning for the Gujarat elections, PM Modi made no public speech. He made
his emotional vote appeal on Twitter, urging his home state to vote in record
numbers on Thursday, when polling for the second and last phase of elections
will be held. ""I call upon the people of Gujarat to not only give the BJP an
overwhelming majority but also ensure that BJP wins in every polling booth
across the state,"" the prime minister said.

""The lies that our worthy opponents have spread, about Gujarat, Gujarat's
growth and about me personally is something I had never imagined. It is
natural for every Gujarati to feel hurt. People of Gujarat will give a fitting
reply to the negativity and lies of the opposition,"" the Prime Minister said,
taking on Congress president designate Rahul Gandhi, who wrapped up his
Gujarat campaign earlier in the day with a press conference in Ahmedabad,
where he attacked PM Modi and the BJP over a list of issues and promised to
reverse the fate of the people of Gujarat, who he alleged were deprived of
real growth with the ruling BJP initiating ""only one-sided development.""

PM Modi went to the famous Ambaji temple in Mehsana to offer prayers on the
last day of campaigning.

PM Modi pitched to Gujarat the advantages of having a BJP government both the
Centre and the state. ""With the Government of India and Government of Gujarat
working together, the strength rises manifold. This 1+ 1 is not 2 but 11 and
together we will take Gujarat to new heights, the Prime Minister tweeted, also
saying, ""Victory of BJP is a guarantee for a bright future.""

Both PM Modi and Rahul Gandhi had planned to end the high-octave Gujarat
campaign with road shows in Ahmedabad. Both were cancelled with the Gujarat
police refusing permission for fear of law and order problems.

Rahul Gandhi asserted in his press conference that the Congress is set to
wrest control of Gujarat from the BJP, promising a ""zabardast"" verdict on
Monday next. In a jibe at the Prime Minister's sea-plane ride, Rahul Gandhi
said it was ""a distraction from the main issues of Gujarat.""

Voting will be held in 93 constituencies of Gujarat on Thursday. Polling for
89 of the state's 182 seats was held on Saturday last. Votes will be counted
on Monday next, December 18.

**Who in India wears the sari?** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: A New York Times article published last month attracted widespread attention because of its claim that fashion in India was being driven by a nationalist agenda. The article by Asgar Qadri argued that India has witnessed a state-led promotion of traditional attire in general, and the sari in particular, as part of a broader attempt to ‚Äúproject multi-faith India as a Hindu nation‚Äù, ever since the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rose to power in 2014.

But the central premise of the article about the sari being a Hindu attire is not backed by data. A Mint analysis of data from the last round of the consumer expenditure survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) shows that the sari enjoys broad appeal across religious groups, with a majority of Christian and Muslim households reporting buying at least one sari in the year preceding the survey. This survey covering more than 100,000 households across the country was conducted in 2011-12, well before Modi became India‚Äôs prime minister (see chart 1).

Overall, eight out of every 10 households in India reported purchasing at least one sari. The share of households purchasing saris is higher in rural India at 85%. In urban India, 74% households reported purchasing saris.

Among Sikhs, the share of households which bought saris is very low. But that seems to have more to do with geography than with religion. Most Sikhs are from Punjab, where the overall share of households purchasing saris is very small.

The sari is almost universally popular in the south and parts of eastern India, with an overwhelming majority of households reporting purchasing at least one sari. It is far less popular in the north-western states, where the overwhelming majority did not report the purchase of even one sari in the year preceding the NSSO survey (see chart 2)

In fact, once we account for regional differences in sartorial preferences, the differences in sari purchases across the two major religious groups‚ÄîHindus and Muslims‚Äîalmost disappears. The share of Muslim households reporting purchases of saris is high in states where the figure for Hindu households is high and low in states where the figure for Hindu households is low, as the scatter-plot shows (see chart 3).

Apart from the six in the fourth quadrant, all other states lie on either the first or the third quadrant, indicating a broad linear relationship between Hindu and Muslim consumption of saris.

The sari also nearly manages to breach the class divide in the country. The share of households belonging to the top decile which reported purchasing a sari at 77% was only slightly higher than the comparative figure for the bottom decile (72%). But the poorer income classes spent proportionately more on saris than the rich. The top and bottom deciles refer to the top 10% and bottom 10% of households respectively, when ranked according to their overall annual consumption expenditure (see chart 4)

The NSSO data also shows a sharp regional skew when it comes to other outfits for women, such as skirts and kurta-pyjama suits. While the former is more popular in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the country, the latter seems to be more popular in the north and the west. In some northern states such as Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, the share of households reporting the purchase of the (female) kurta-pyjama suit is low. But that appears to be because most households tend to purchase cloth for these items rather than ready-made suits (see chart 5 and chart 6).

The class divide in the purchase of both these outfits is sharper than in the case of the sari. 35% of households belonging to the top decile reported purchasing a female kurta-pyjama suit but the comparative figure for the bottom decile was much lower at 6%.

Similarly, the share of households belonging to the top decile which purchased skirts (or frocks) at 27% was 15 percentage points higher than the share of households belonging to the bottom decile which made similar purchases.

Overall, geography and wealth seem to have a far greater influence on the sartorial choices of Indian women than religion.

This is the first of a two-part series on what Indians wear. The second part will examine the sartorial choices of Indian men.

**Karnataka: Don‚Äôt hesitate to bluff voters, BJP leader tells workers** 

 ______ 
Former deputy chief minister K S Eshwarappa

Video footage of a senior BJP leader in Karnataka asking party workers never to hesitate from bluffing to voters to win political support in the state has served as ammunition for the ruling Congress in the state to question the legitimacy of political issues raised by the BJP.

In the video, former deputy chief minister K S Eshwarappa asked party workers at a meeting in Koppal region of Karnataka on December 4 to lie to voters if necessary to win their support.

‚ÄúWe need to tell the people about all the accomplishments of the BJP ‚Äî the government at the centre and what we will do in Karnataka ‚Äî we need to tell people about what we have done for backward castes, scheduled castes, for farmers, for women. In case you do not know, tell some lies or something. We are politicians, we should not say we don‚Äôt know when it comes to anything,‚Äô‚Äô he is heard saying in the video footage.

He goes on to give the example of using Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs macho image to embellish narratives about the BJP‚Äôs achievements if necessary.

‚ÄúYou must say that Pakistan never dared attack India when Vajpayee was Prime Minister, but when Manmohan Singh became the PM Indian soldiers were attacked and killed by Pakistan‚Äôs army. You must say that when Modi became the PM he finished 10 soldiers in Pakistan. You must spin it like that. Even if you don‚Äôt know these things, you are aware of the machismo of PM Modi, use that to spin a story ‚Äî we will see what happens later,‚Äô‚Äô Eshwarappa said.

‚ÄúWhen you visit the homes of people, if you sit quietly when they tell you that Manmohan Singh provided great administration when he was PM or when they tell you that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has done a lot for Dalits, then we will have to shut shop and go away,‚Äù Eshwarappa tells the workers.

The Congress targeted the BJP leader, saying his speech is a reflection of BJP political strategy. ‚ÄúThe statements by Eshwarappa are a reflection of the BJP‚Äôs political strategy and culture. They are spreading lies through their campaigns around the state and urging party workers to follow their actions,‚Äù Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao said.

Eshwarappa refused to comment on the video, saying that his speech was made at an internal meeting for BJP workers.

PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs none-too-veiled innuendo in an election speech in
Banaskantha district on Sunday has severely let down his constitutional
commitment and office

If politics in a mature constitutional democracy is also about the unwritten
rules of the game, if it includes a reciprocal pact between players to
acknowledge and uphold dignity, their own and their opponent‚Äôs, then this is a
disquieting day. PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs none-too-veiled innuendo in an election
speech in Banaskantha district on Sunday has severely let down his
constitutional commitment and office. A day after the first phase of polling
in Gujarat, he spoke about a former Pakistani army officer allegedly showing
undue interest in the election and supporting Ahmed Patel for chief minister.
And about a dinner meeting at Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs home, where
Indian dignitaries, including a former PM, vice-president and army chief, met
with a Pakistani delegation, including the Pak high commissioner, to hold
secret talks in the midst of Gujarat polls. The import of the PM‚Äôs statements
was inescapable and grim: Speaking in the same breath of the Congress,
Pakistan and a Muslim candidate for CM, he suggested that they are partners in
an unholy, rather anti-national, conspiracy. In one stroke, he labelled his
political opponent as unpatriotic and lent the immense weight of his office to
a shameful politics of stereotyping that holds all of India‚Äôs Muslims to be
pro-Pakistan and guilty.

Whether the BJP wins the Gujarat election, or loses it, the PM‚Äôs day out in
Banaskantha should bring a moment of reflection and pause. So far, over the
last three years or so of the Modi regime, whenever unseemly and outright
bigoted statements were made that cast the Muslim as the Other, the Anti-
National, and the Enemy, the PM‚Äôs office was singed. And yet, it maintained a
modicum of distance and deniability. It was the fringe, it could be said, and
in any case, these were sporadic excesses that a large party like the BJP
couldn‚Äôt possibly control. On Hindus and Muslims, in the Lok Sabha campaign on
the eve of the 2014 polls in Bihar, Candidate Modi had struck a high note.
Muslims and Hindus must not fight each other, he said, but together battle
poverty. When he repeated that statement as PM during another Bihar campaign,
this time for the state assembly, not even his party president Amit Shah‚Äôs
incendiary remark, that firecrackers would be burst in Pakistan should the BJP
lose, could fully extinguish the distinction between the PM and the Rest.

Now, the PM‚Äôs statements at Banaskantha imperil that distinction. Several of
Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs guests, including and especially former Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh, have denied PM Modi‚Äôs version of the dinner party. Gujarat was
not on the menu, they have said. The Modi government has sought to challenge
their response, but the damage is done. It travels far and runs deep. Next
time there is a hate crime, the next time a Shambhulal Regar counts on state
protection and impunity, the silence of the PM can ‚Äî and should ‚Äî be
interrogated more loudly.

**Narendra Modi has to lift India‚Äôs political discourse** 

 ______ 
The political discourse in India is plumbing new depths, one election campaign
after another. Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint

The Gujarat election campaign has been ugly, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
has escalated the bitterness in his speeches. Sharp verbal sparring has**
**long been a feature of Indian politics, but Modi has crossed a red line by
insinuating that his political rivals are working against India‚Äôs national
interest. His remarks do not do justice to the constitutional position he
holds.

The opposition has also called Modi ugly names. Few will forget Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs
unacceptable _maut ka saudagar_ (merchant of death) remark. Mani Shankar Aiyar
is a serial offender‚Äîand his most recent remark is part of a pattern. Tej
Pratap Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal** **crossed all boundaries of decency
when he threatened to skin Modi alive. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may
argue that Modi is merely giving it back, but the prime minister of the
country has to adhere to higher standards of conduct than others.

First, Modi has tried to link three seemingly unconnected events: 1) an
unverified Twitter handle purportedly belonging to Sardar Arshad Rafiq, former
director general of the Pakistan army, calling for the Congress‚Äô Ahmed Patel
to be made Gujarat‚Äôs chief minister; 2) a meeting at Aiyar‚Äôs residence
featuring a former Pakistan foreign minister, the current high commissioner of
Pakistan, along with former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, former
Indian vice-president Hamid Ansari, a former Indian Army chief and a few
former Indian diplomats; and 3) Aiyar insulting the Prime Minister by calling
him a _‚Äúneech kisam ka aadmi _(a low-level kind of person)‚Äù a day after this
meeting. The undertone is clear: Modi is effectively accusing those present at
the meeting, including Singh and Ansari, of treason. Coming from the Prime
Minister, not a BJP spokesperson, this is unacceptable.

If the Prime Minister has evidence that the meeting at Aiyar‚Äôs residence was
in any way linked to the Gujarat election, he should place it in the public
domain and prosecute those present at the meeting. But if Modi has no
evidence, he should stop building false narratives. Among those present at the
meeting, respected names such as former army chief Deepak Kapoor and former
top diplomat Chinmaya Gharekhan, have already clarified that the Gujarat
election did not figure even remotely in the discussions. A visiting
delegation from Pakistan is free to meet India‚Äôs opposition politicians and
former officers as long as the discussions are not intended to destabilize
Indian democracy. The Prime Minister should not milk such routine meetings for
electoral purposes.

Second, Modi also brought up the issue of the Congress party‚Äôs Rahul Gandhi
meeting the Chinese ambassador, Luo Zhaohui, at the peak of the Dokalam
standoff. It is true that the Congress had goofed up by first denying the
meeting and later admitting it took place. However, as a prominent
representative of the opposition bench, Gandhi was perfectly within his rights
to meet Luo. And once he had acknowledged it, the issue was over. It was
completely unnecessary ****on Modi‚Äôs part to raise this irrelevant matter in
the Gujarat election campaign.

Third, Modi used a public rally to ask former prime minister Singh why he did
not use the option of surgical strikes against Pakistan after the 26/11 Mumbai
attacks in 2008. This newspaper supported Modi‚Äôs decision to launch surgical
strikes against Pakistan in September 2016. And it is definitely open to
debate whether Singh‚Äôs decision not to retaliate after 26/11 was a wise one
(we had then argued for a ‚Äúmuscular response‚Äù). But not only is the issue old,
it is again irrelevant to the Gujarat election. In the context of other
remarks Modi has been making, it seems as if he is trying to look for ulterior
motives for Singh‚Äôs decision not to retaliate against Pakistan.

In response to Modi‚Äôs charges‚Äîespecially the first one, of a conspiracy angle
in the meeting at Aiyar‚Äôs residence‚ÄîSingh has released a furious statement
pointing to his five decades of service to the nation. Modi, or for that
matter anyone, is allowed to critically evaluate Singh‚Äôs contributions to the
country, but his patriotism should certainly not be under the scanner. As the
serving prime minister, Modi should appreciate the constraints under which
Singh and other people in India‚Äôs highest political office have operated in
the past.

The political discourse in India is plumbing new depths one election campaign
after another. No party has a clean record, and the BJP has actively
contributed to the degeneration. In the Bihar election campaign of 2015, for
example, BJP president Amit Shah said his party‚Äôs loss would be celebrated by
the bursting of firecrackers in Pakistan. In another instance, Union home
minister Rajnath Singh relied on a tweet by a fake handle to allege that the
student protests at Jawaharlal Nehru University were backed by Hafiz Saeed,
the chief of terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba. The BJP‚Äôs alacrity in
finding a foreign hand in domestic opposition forces is reminiscent of the
1970s, when Indira Gandhi was prime minister.

It is often argued that Modi and Shah prefer to go in all guns blazing during
elections‚Äîand that their actual conduct is far more restrained. For example,
on Twitter, Modi recently wished Sonia Gandhi on her birthday and
congratulated Rahul Gandhi on his new role in the Congress. However,
accusations made for temporary electoral reasons have lingering social effects
in our partisan times. The Prime Minister should realize that no election
victory is worth undermining the quality of Indian democracy.

PM Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad. (Express photo: Javed Raja/File)

The conduct of the Prime Minister of India during the Gujarat election should
set alarm bells ringing. Narendra Modi‚Äôs innuendo in an election speech in
Banaskantha, in which he strung together communal canards and conspiracy
theories, marks a new and dangerous low in Indian politics.

It is perhaps a sign of the times, the new normal, that the demeaning of the
office of the prime minister, low level demagoguery or even communal canards
will not bother many citizens. In fact, these are now the central elements of
the PM‚Äôs mystique, eclipsing whatever other promises he might have made about
development. But these innuendos also show a prime minister creating the
wildest conspiracy theories, not because they serve the national interest, but
because they satiate his need for claiming monopoly over patriotism, perpetual
scapegoating and playing the politics of victimhood. God help the country
whose prime minister is now in such a frame of mind.

**Also Read | ****Editorial: No, Prime Minister**

The innuendo that former Pakistani officials were showing undue interest in
supporting Ahmed Patel, that the former Prime Minister of India somehow held
secret talks at the residence of Mani Shankar Aiyar during the Gujarat
elections, whose purpose was to hatch some anti-national conspiracy, would be
laughable if it were not shameful and dangerous. Think of all the dangers
inherent in the prime minister himself not just putting his weight behind this
story, but conjuring it out of thin air. It was an uncalled for attack on
former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

In a democracy there will be deep disagreements, there will also be attacks on
particular leaders‚Äô competencies, and sometimes their decisions will be
questioned. True or false, these things are par for the course in a
competitive democracy. But for a prime minister to paint a picture of a former
prime minister as part of some social cabal in cahoots with foreign powers to
meddle in the Gujarat elections is despicable. Whatever your political views,
former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs quiet, exemplary and thoughtful
patriotism is self-evident and needs no defence. For Manmohan Singh,
patriotism was not, as it has become for Modi, a scimitar to cut down
political opponents and claim monopoly of nationalism. For a PM to suggest
that his political opponents are doing something bordering on treasonous is to
open the floodgates of a new viciousness.

If unhinged conspiracy theories about possibly treasonous socialising were not
enough, this story was dripping with communal canards. The entire Gujarat
campaign has been, even by the low standards set during the last three years,
dripping in communal innuendo. At points, the BJP campaign has presented our
only choices as being between Mandir and Masjid. The arguments over history,
from Khilji to Babar, the pet themes of this election, are not about history:
They are about Hindu majoritarianism wanting to make Muslims increasingly
irrelevant to India‚Äôs history.

But perhaps Modi did us a favour. You could say that in this campaign, he has,
at last, broken his silence on the communal poison spreading through Indian
political life. He now wants to shed whatever last veneer of deniability was
left and claim full-throated responsibility for spreading this poison.

By stringing together, in a crass case of loaded free association, Ahmed
Patel, Congress and Pakistan in a seamless social web, Modi betrayed a whole
series of prejudices that are unworthy of the Prime Minister of India: That
Indian Muslim political leaders are always going to be under the pall of
suspicion that they are in league with Pakistan. It is once again to raise the
bogey that when it comes to patriotism a senior Muslim politician will be
guilty of association with Pakistan until proven innocent. The consequence of
this marginalising of the political agency of members of a community for
Indian constitutional values are going to be profound.

Whether we will any longer be shocked by the degradation of public discourse,
by the diminution of the moral stature of the office of the prime minister, by
open communalism, is an open question. Again, whatever one‚Äôs political views,
Modi‚Äôs gift as a politician was to exude self-confidence, seduce the
electorate in a way that artfully disguised the potential poison he might
carry, and to tap into both the hope of development and the politics of fear
simultaneously. In this campaign, more than any other in recent years, the
sense of control and confidence has gone, the potential communal poison is not
just one element that might be contained, but is becoming his whole being, and
the politics of hope has been replaced entirely by the politics of fear. Only
this can explain why a party that has been for so long in power in Gujarat, is
running as if it were a vicious rabble-rousing outfit.

But more seriously, Modi is increasingly showing a combination of qualities
that should worry even his supporters. The more his power has grown, the more
his speeches exude insecurity. A combination of great power and a deep sense
of insecurity does not bode well. Even after the people of India have reposed
power in him, his need to constantly play up a sense of personal and national
victimhood, his need to perpetually play into stereotypes about minorities,
has grown rather than diminished with his time in office. Paranoia is
replacing confidence. Whatever Modi‚Äôs own political experiences, nothing in
them justifies him playing a ‚ÄúCongress-Muslim-Pakistan conspiracy‚Äù card in the
manner in which he has done in the election.

Perhaps Modi will win the Gujarat election. The personal identification with
him is perhaps too far gone for his supporters to divest of him easily. More
ominously, Indian democracy is at a crossroads where all its inner demons and
repressed ugliness are playing out in the open. This is a time that requires
statesmanship, not nauseating divisiveness.

The prime minister, instead of navigating constitutional values, ordinary
decencies of discourse and civility, to safe harbour, is now bent on creating
new storms. Whether he wins or loses in Gujarat, he is spreading a poison from
which Indian politics will find it hard to recover for quite some time. In
shoring his power through conflict he is taking India down the road to ruin.

**Don‚Äôt hesitate to bluff voters, Karnataka BJP leader tells workers**

By:

Express News Service

Updated: December 13, 2017 8:17 am

Former deputy chief minister K S Eshwarappa (File Photo)

Video footage of a senior BJP leader in Karnataka asking party workers never
to hesitate from bluffing to voters to win political support in the state has
served as ammunition for the ruling Congress in the state to question the
legitimacy of political issues raised by the BJP.

In the video, former deputy chief minister K S Eshwarappa asked party workers
at a meeting in Koppal region of Karnataka on December 4 to lie to voters if
necessary to win their support.

‚ÄúWe need to tell the people about all the accomplishments of the BJP ‚Äî the
government at the centre and what we will do in Karnataka ‚Äî we need to tell
people about what we have done for backward castes, scheduled castes, for
farmers, for women. In case you do not know, tell some lies or something. We
are politicians, we should not say we don‚Äôt know when it comes to anything,‚Äô‚Äô
he is heard saying in the video footage.

VIDEO

He goes on to give the example of using Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs macho
image to embellish narratives about the BJP‚Äôs achievements if necessary.

‚ÄúYou must say that Pakistan never dared attack India when Vajpayee was Prime
Minister, but when Manmohan Singh became the PM Indian soldiers were attacked
and killed by Pakistan‚Äôs army. You must say that when Modi became the PM he
finished 10 soldiers in Pakistan. You must spin it like that. Even if you
don‚Äôt know these things, you are aware of the machismo of PM Modi, use that to
spin a story ‚Äî we will see what happens later,‚Äô‚Äô Eshwarappa said.

‚ÄúWhen you visit the homes of people, if you sit quietly when they tell you
that Manmohan Singh provided great administration when he was PM or when they
tell you that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has done a lot for Dalits, then we
will have to shut shop and go away,‚Äù Eshwarappa tells the workers.

The Congress targeted the BJP leader, saying his speech is a reflection of BJP
political strategy. ‚ÄúThe statements by Eshwarappa are a reflection of the
BJP‚Äôs political strategy and culture. They are spreading lies through their
campaigns around the state and urging party workers to follow their actions,‚Äù
Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao said.

Eshwarappa refused to comment on the video, saying that his speech was made at
an internal meeting for BJP workers.

**Opinion: Nailing Modi's Lies On Pak And Gujarat Election** 

 ______ 
_""Satyameva Jayate""_

(Truth Alone Triumphs) is India's national motto. It is inscribed on our
national emblem, the Lion Capital of Sarnath, below the Dharma Chakra or
Ashoka Chakra, which also finds pride of place on our national flag. Even
though these were adopted by our sagacious Constitution makers after India
became independent in 1947 and declared itself a Republic in 1950, the motto
and the emblem proclaim our motherland's civilisational antiquity.

Not many know that our national motto is an abridgement of a line that says:

_""Satyameva Jayate naanritam""_

. It is taken from a sacred

_mantra_

in the Mundaka Upanishad (3.1.6), which reads:

_""Satyameva jayate naanritam / Satyena pantha vitato devayanah _

(Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood. Through Truth the divine path is spread
out).""

The message of

_""Satyameva Jayate""_

is further reinforced by

_""naanritam""_

which means ""Falsehood shall never prevail"". This is a profoundly
philosophical affirmation, a law applicable to the working of both the entire
cosmos and the entire humanity.

_'Rta'_

connotes Truth or the right order of things and events in Nature and in the
wider universe. The sages of ancient India extrapolated the concept of

_'rta'_

from the non-human to the human domain by establishing the principle of Dharma
- the law that secures the moral order in human life. The Dharma Chakra, a
holy symbol that links us to our Buddhist past, declares the same ethical
message - the Wheel of the Law of Truth turns eternally and tolerates no
obstruction.

Thus, the greatness of our Constitution lies in the fact that it has tied the
life and affairs of our Republic to certain timeless verities. If India has to
survive and thrive, and if India has to become a

_'Vishwa Guru'_

(a teacher and exemplar to the rest of the world) - a favorite phrase of the
RSS, the BJP's mother and mentor organization - neither our society, much less
the Indian state, should follow the ways of

_asatya_

(falsehood) and

_adharma_

(unethical). When the king resorts to lies and trickery, chaos in the country
is inevitable.

Sadly and shockingly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi abandoned the virtue of
self-restraint expected of the high constitutional office he holds and fell to
the temptation of a blatant falsehood while campaigning for his party's
victory in the Gujarat election. With not a shred of evidence to back his
grave charge, he has accused former prime minister and his predecessor Dr
Manmohan Singh, former Vice President Dr Hamid Ansari, and others who attended
a dinner meeting at the residence of Mani Shankar Aiyar in the national
capital on December 6 of conspiring with Pakistan to influence the outcome of
the Gujarat polls.

At an election rally on December 10, he alleged that a day after the three-
hour-long ""secret meeting with the Pakistani High Commissioner"", Aiyar called
him

_""neech""_

(low-level) and ""insulted Gujarat"". He deliberately twisted

_""neech""_

to mean

_""neech jaati""_

(low caste) just to seek electoral advantage. He went on to ask: ""What was the
reason for holding such a secret meeting, especially when an election is going
on in Gujarat?"" Furthermore, he alleged, ""A former Pakistan army director
general, Arshad Rafique, had said Ahmed Patel (Congress leader and a close
aide of outgoing Congress president Sonia Gandhi) should be the Chief Minister
of Gujarat.""

Modi's lies can be nailed on several counts. First of all, there was nothing
""secret"" - hence conspiratorial - about the dinner meeting at Aiyar's place.
Aiyar had hosted it in honour of Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, former foreign
minister of Pakistan, who is his longtime friend and also a well-known friend
of India. As India's self-proclaimed

_""chowkidar"",_

the Prime Minister could have easily satisfied himself, with information from
his intelligence agencies about the guest list, that this was not a secret
meeting. Second, as has now been made public by the media and also by Dr
Manmohan Singh himself in his scalding reposte to Modi's accusation, the
meeting was attended, among others, by a former Indian army chief, a former
foreign minister, a former foreign secretary and four former Indian High
Commissioners to Pakistan. It is ridiculous, also malicious, for the prime
minister to suggest that all these eminent public servants attended a ""secret
meeting"" with Pakistan's former foreign minister and Pakistan's current high
commissioner Sohail Mahmood to discuss the desired (anti-BJP) outcome of
Gujarat elections. Third, several participants in the dinner meeting have
publicly countered the PM by saying that its sole agenda was a discussion on
India-Pakistan relations, and not Gujarat elections.

Modi has not said that making Ahmed Patel was discussed at this meeting.
However, he used innuendo to link this meeting with ""Pakistan's retired army
chief's interference in Gujarat's election"". Obviously, Modi's intent was to
create, and exploit anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan sentiments among voters,
hoping that such polarisation would boost the chances of the BJP's victory in
the elections.

As a matter of fact, Kasuri, during his stay in Delhi, also participated in
two other public events whose agenda was how to improve India-Pakistan
relations. I attended one of them, organised by O.P. Shah (a non-political
activist working for Indo-Pak peace and peace in Kashmir), on December 8.
Aiyar and many intellectuals were present, and so was Pakistan's high
commissioner. There was no discussion on Gujarat.

I must nail another lie and insinuation by the prime minister. At an earlier
election rally in Gujarat, Modi said, ""After I became prime minister, this man
(Aiyar) went to Pakistan and met some Pakistanis. In that meeting, he is seen
discussing with Pakistanis that

_""jab tak Modi ko raaste se hataya nahi jata_

(until Modi is removed from the way)"", the relationship between India and
Pakistan cannot improve. ...Someone tell me what is the meaning of

_'""raaste se hatana""_

? You had gone to Pakistan to give Modi's

_'supari'_

(contract killing).""

Aiyar had made this remark on Pakistani TV on a show in which I too was
interviewed. (Both of us had gone to Karachi in 2015 to participate in the
launch of Kasuri's book

_Neither a Hawk nor a Dove_

.) I did not endorse Aiyar's indiscreet remark. (I have also publicly
criticised as ""deplorable"" his

_""neech""_

comment about the prime minister.) However, nothing that the recently
suspended Congress leader said in Pakistan can be remotely construed as giving
a

_""supari""_

for Modi's physical ""removal"".

How can sane people in BJP-RSS defend the PM?

The BJP may well win in Gujarat again. However, it does not behove a prime
minister, who has taken an oath to uphold the highest principles and ideals of
the Indian constitution, to utter falsehoods and twist his political
opponents' remarks to convey an impression that they are anti-nationals,
traitors, and stooges of the ""enemy"" nation Pakistan. His disrespect for
truth, and for others who have held high constitutional offices, has invited a
stinging criticism from mild-mannered Dr Manmohan Singh. A former PM demanding
an apology from an incumbent PM is unprecedented in India's history. And so is
an official rebuke from Pakistan - ""India should stop dragging Pakistan into
its electoral debate and win victories on own strength rather than fabricated
conspiracies, which are utterly baseless and irresponsible.""

Hasn't all this dishonoured the august office of India's prime minister?
Hasn't this lowered the international community's admiration for India's
democracy? And if the prime minister himself makes

_""Asatyameva Jayate""_

his motto, just to win a state election, shouldn't sane leaders in the BJP and
RSS, who dream of India as a

_""Vishwa Guru'""_

, sit up and worry about what is going on?

# Big win for PM Modi, India rises to 100th spot on Legatum Prosperity Index;

## After rising up in the Ease of Doing Business Index, India has upgraded its
ranks in 'The Legatum Prosperity Index 2017' as well.

India climbed up by four places in the Legatum Prosperity Index (Source: PTI)

Narendra Modi government push on Vikas is bearing fruits. After rising up in
the Ease of Doing Business Index, India has upgraded its ranks in ‚ÄòThe Legatum
Prosperity Index 2017‚Äô as well. India has managed to come within top 100
prosperous countries for the first time as per the report. Out of all the nine
indices, India‚Äôs ‚ÄòGovernance‚Äô has been ranked best with 41st rank. The index,
which offers an insight into how prosperity is forming and changing across the
world, ranks India 100th on the list of prosperous countries among 149
countries. Notably, India has climbed 4 positions from 104 to 100 when
compared to last year. ‚ÄúIn the Prosperity Pillar rankings, India performs best
on Governance and Economic Quality and scores lowest on the Natural
Environment pillar. The biggest positive change, compared to last year, came
in Business Environment increasing by 21 places,‚Äù said the official release.
However, India is still far behind neighbouring countries like China (52) and
Sri Lanka (61), Thailand (48), and Nepal (89). Bangladesh, which ranks 103,
follows India closely.

The list has been topped by Norway, performing exceptionally well on
parameters like Business Environment, Economic Quality, Natural Environment,
Governance, Social Capital, Education, Personal Freedom, Safety, Security, and
Health. Yemen, due to the ongoing civil war bottomed the list. Check out
India‚Äôs performance on each front:-

Economic Quality- 56th  
Business Environment- 65th  
Governance- 41st  
Education- 99th  
Health- 109th  
Safety &amp;amp; Security- 134th  
Personal Freedom- 100th  
Social Capital- 82nd  
Natural Environment- 139th

However, safety and security (134th) and natural environment (107th) still
remain a huge reason of worry for the government. India recorded the second
largest increase in the business environment after South Africa that saw the
largest jump due to reduced electricity connection costs and an improved
Logistics Performance Index.  
The Legatum Prosperity Index is an annual ranking developed by the Legatum
Institute, a division of the private investment firm Legatum. The Legatum
Institute, the publisher of the index, is a privately funded think-tank
founded in 2007 and located in Mayfair, London.

laughable if it were not shameful and dangerous. Think of all the dangers

former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

In a democracy there will be deep disagreements, there will also be attacks on
particular leaders‚Äô competencies, and sometimes their decisions will be
questioned. True or false, these things are par for the course in a
competitive democracy. But for a prime minister to paint a picture of a former
prime minister as part of some social cabal in cahoots with foreign powers to
meddle in the Gujarat elections is despicable. Whatever your political views,
former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs quiet, exemplary and thoughtful
patriotism is self-evident and needs no defence. For Manmohan Singh,
patriotism was not, as it has become for Modi, a scimitar to cut down
political opponents and claim monopoly of nationalism. For a PM to suggest
that his political opponents are doing something bordering on treasonous is to
open the floodgates of a new viciousness.

If unhinged conspiracy theories about possibly treasonous socialising were not
enough, this story was dripping with communal canards. The entire Gujarat
campaign has been, even by the low standards set during the last three years,
dripping in communal innuendo. At points, the BJP campaign has presented our
only choices as being between Mandir and Masjid. The arguments over history,
from Khilji to Babar, the pet themes of this election, are not about history:
They are about Hindu majoritarianism wanting to make Muslims increasingly
irrelevant to India‚Äôs history.

But perhaps Modi did us a favour. You could say that in this campaign, he has,
at last, broken his silence on the communal poison spreading through Indian
political life. He now wants to shed whatever last veneer of deniability was
left and claim full-throated responsibility for spreading this poison.

By stringing together, in a crass case of loaded free association, Ahmed
Patel, Congress and Pakistan in a seamless social web, Modi betrayed a whole
series of prejudices that are unworthy of the Prime Minister of India: That
Indian Muslim political leaders are always going to be under the pall of
suspicion that they are in league with Pakistan. It is once again to raise the
bogey that when it comes to patriotism a senior Muslim politician will be
guilty of association with Pakistan until proven innocent. The consequence of
this marginalising of the political agency of members of a community for
Indian constitutional values are going to be profound.

Whether we will any longer be shocked by the degradation of public discourse,
by the diminution of the moral stature of the office of the prime minister, by
open communalism, is an open question. Again, whatever one‚Äôs political views,
Modi‚Äôs gift as a politician was to exude self-confidence, seduce the
electorate in a way that artfully disguised the potential poison he might
carry, and to tap into both the hope of development and the politics of fear
simultaneously. In this campaign, more than any other in recent years, the
sense of control and confidence has gone, the potential communal poison is not
just one element that might be contained, but is becoming his whole being, and
the politics of hope has been replaced entirely by the politics of fear. Only
this can explain why a party that has been for so long in power in Gujarat, is
running as if it were a vicious rabble-rousing outfit.

But more seriously, Modi is increasingly showing a combination of qualities
that should worry even his supporters. The more his power has grown, the more
his speeches exude insecurity. A combination of great power and a deep sense
of insecurity does not bode well. Even after the people of India have reposed
power in him, his need to constantly play up a sense of personal and national
victimhood, his need to perpetually play into stereotypes about minorities,
has grown rather than diminished with his time in office. Paranoia is
replacing confidence. Whatever Modi‚Äôs own political experiences, nothing in
them justifies him playing a ‚ÄúCongress-Muslim-Pakistan conspiracy‚Äù card in the
manner in which he has done in the election.

Perhaps Modi will win the Gujarat election. The personal identification with
him is perhaps too far gone for his supporters to divest of him easily. More
ominously, Indian democracy is at a crossroads where all its inner demons and
repressed ugliness are playing out in the open. This is a time that requires
statesmanship, not nauseating divisiveness.

The prime minister, instead of navigating constitutional values, ordinary
decencies of discourse and civility, to safe harbour, is now bent on creating
new storms. Whether he wins or loses in Gujarat, he is spreading a poison from
which Indian politics will find it hard to recover for quite some time. In
shoring his power through conflict he is taking India down the road to ruin.

**Govt proposes special courts to fast track criminal cases against politicians** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi had promised that if elected to power, the NDA would find a
mechanism to fast track cases against politicians, especially MPs and MLAs.

**New Delhi: **The Centre has told the Supreme Court that it proposes to set up 12 special courts to try a total of 1,581 criminal cases pending against legislators across the country.

In an affidavit, the centre said that Rs65 lakh would be required for setting
up each of these courts, bringing the total up to Rs7.8 crore. These would be
set up for a period of one year to fast track disposal of cases against
legislators.

‚ÄúThe scheme envisages setting up for 12 special courts for a period of one
year to dispose cases against political persons at an expenditure of Rs7.8
crore. On 8 December, the Department of expenditure, ministry of finance has
given-in-principle approval for the same,‚Äù said the 14-page affidavit.

The move is significant because it was one of the main poll promises made by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the election campaign of 2014. Modi had
promised that if elected to power, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
would find a mechanism to fast track cases against politicians, especially
Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

Reiterating its commitment to act against politicians with criminal cases, the
government had asked home minister Rajnath Singh and law minister Ravi Shankar
Prasad to find ways to fast track these cases.

The Centre, however, sought more time to collate information on the status of
these 1,581 cases from 2014 onwards involving MPs and MLAs, including
information on how many of these had been disposed of within a year and how
many had ended in conviction or acquittal

On 1 November, a bench comprising justices Ranjan Gogoi and Navin Sinha
directed the centre to set up special fast-track courts to deal with pending
cases against legislators. It gave them a timeline of six weeks to submit the
scheme for setting up such courts along with the costs.

The Election Commission (EC) had told the court that it supported
decriminalization of politics through a lifetime ban on members of Parliament
and legislative assemblies, who at present can contest elections even after
being convicted in criminal cases.It also submitted that recommendations of
the EC and Law Commission for lifetime disqualification of politicians
convicted in criminal cases were under consideration by the government.

The court was hearing a plea by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman and
advocate Ashwini Kumar. He challenged the provisions of the Representation of
the People Act, 1951, which bars convicted politicians from contesting
elections for six years after having served the jail term.

The plea also sought a direction to the centre and the EC to fix minimum
educational qualifications and a maximum age limit for election candidates.

**View: By flirting with FRDI Bill, Modi government may be playing with fire** 

 ______ 
The world of

Rajaram Shinde

is changing. The retired central government official is moving his money from
State Bank of India to Kotak. Mr Shinde is not exactly enamoured by the
advertisements of the

private sector lender

or its promises. He is not a demanding customer, has no fancy needs. But, like
everyone with a bank account, there's one thing he believes is non-negotiable:
the safety of his money. Not that he ever felt there was a concern. Until now.

It all began with strange WhatsApp messages. He ignored them. What he couldn't
disregard were unbelievable stories in large, mainline English and Marathi
newspapers. The reports talked about a new Bill, which once enacted, could
freeze ‚Äî at least temporarily ‚Äî or even knock off a slice of deposits of a
troubled bank. The objective is to save the bank by making depositors pay.

**Tough choice**

Having stayed away from

co-operative banks

, which are often the preferred choice of many in western India despite a few
failures, it never crossed his mind that high-street, government-owned banks
could do the same.

But then, here's a Bill that would apply to all financial institutions,
including public sector as well as private banks; so it made perfect sense for
Mr Shinde, who after checking the stock and financial performance of Kotak ‚Äî
the bank with a branch that's nearest to his home ‚Äî to think of gradually
shifting his savings to a healthy private bank. After all, if the government
chooses not back a bank where it's the majority owner, why not move to a
strong private bank?

To many, Mr Shinde's decision could appear like an extreme step taken by a
libertarian who abandons fiat currency ‚Äî out of distrust towards inept central
banks and stodgy governments ‚Äî to convert his savings into bitcoin or gold.
But that would be unfairly judging a pensioner who is shaken and puzzled by a
Bill.

**Letting it drift**

In all likelihood such a law, at least in its present form, may never see the
light of the day. But what's bewildering is Mr Shinde's suspicion that it
could. (Will the dull-sounding Financial Resolution &amp;amp; Deposit Insurance or

FRDI Bill

turn out to be DeMo 2.0?)

After going unnoticed for months, the Bill suddenly began making news around
November 8, an ominous date. For a week it was confined to social media
chatter and the world of instant messages. There was very little assurance
from the government.

Soon, mainstream media caught on. Despite the excitement around eminently
newsy stuff like the Bankruptcy Code and Gujarat elections, newspapers and
television headlines ran headlines and tickers like, ""Is your deposit safe?""
Still, New Delhi didn't quite get it. Last week, the finance ministry released
a statement saying, ""The FRDI Bill 2017 is far more depositor-friendly than
many other jurisdictions, which provide for statutory bail-in, where consent
of creditors/depositors is not required for bail-in.""

What jurisdictions are we talking about? Cyprus? Greece? Advanced economies,
which had passed such a law, have rarely, if ever, used it. The ministry's
statement probably means that the Bill is better than the law in Cyprus which
was invoked a few years ago to keep banks afloat. Does it really mean much?
It's certainly not enough to comfort Mr Shinde and savers like him with their
nest egg lying in some bank. Finally, on Monday, the finance minister assured
that the government will fully protect the public's deposits in financial
institutions. He couldn't have done anything else, and going by his words the
Bill is in for drastic changes.

**Trust matters**

It's a bizarre turn of events. Never before did the finance minister of a
country ‚Äî with a stable government, booming stock market, and one of the
fastest GDP growth rates ‚Äî had to assure the public about the safety of their
bank deposits. Why did it happen?

Probably the government felt that a debate on 'how to bail-in (instead of
bail-out) banks' has become an imperative. Just like the resolution plan for
bankrupt borrower manufacturers, there should be a law backing resolution for
lender banks. But it's a debate which, if gathers heat, can take us into an
absolutely uncharted territory.

Trust in banks has been the strongest trait of the modern Indian financial
system. No

PSU bank

‚Äî even the ones with eroded capital, unpaid loans, and damaging scandals ‚Äî
ever suffered a run simply because of the state's backing. Successive
governments and the RBI have been calm and quick in dealing with private banks
that failed or faced panicky depositors. Such bail outs were probably unfair
to tax payers. But handling the consequences of letting banks fail or saving
them with depositors' money can be far more challenging.

The FRDI Bill is not the need of the hour. Luckily, not too many people have
taken it seriously. But that can change. If New Delhi thinks it's testing the
waters, it is mistaken. It's playing with fire.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Manmohan Singh greet each other at the
Parliament on Wednesday. (ANI)

Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused his predecessor Manmohan Singh
of colluding with Pakistan, both of them met with folded hands ‚Äì sending a
message that all is well beyond election campaigns. Both Modi and Singh met
outside the Parliament while moving into the House to pay tribute to the
martyrs who had lost their lives in the 2001 Parliament attack carried out by
Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba. Congress president-
elect Rahul Gandhi was also all smiles while meeting Union ministers Ravi
Shankar Prasad and Sushma Swaraj outside the Parliament. (See pics below)

The 2001 attack by LeT targeted the seat of Indian Democracy ‚Äì the Parliament.
As many as six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service
personnel and a gardener were killed in the attack, while five terrorists were
also gunned down. The attack had then increased tensions between India and
Pakistan, also leading to a standoff.

During the Gujarat assembly election campaign, Pakistan‚Äôs alleged interference
in the polls became news after some media reports revealed details of a recent
meeting among Pakistani officials and Indian leaders, including ex-PM Manmohan
Singh, at the residence of suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar. More
so, PM Modi also added fuel to the fire by talking about the media report and
casting doubt over the purpose for which the meeting was held.

PM Narendra Modi, Manmohan Singh shake hands. (ANI)

At a rally in Gujarat, Modi had raised a political storm three days ago,
saying, ‚ÄúWhy is Pakistan interfering in 2017 Gujarat Polls? Ex-Pak Army DG had
said Ahmed Patel should be made CM,‚Äù Modi further said senior Congress leader
Mani Shankar Aiyar had held ‚Äúsecret‚Äù meetings with Pakistan High Commissioner
in New Delhi.

##  leader Ravishankar Prasad. (ANI)

Asking for the reason behind the meeting, Modi said, ‚ÄúThe same Mani Shankar
Aiyar, who insulted Gujarat, held secret meetings with Pakistan High
Commissioner. What was the reason? Why are people who previously held high
posts in military-intelligence establishment of Pakistan writing that we
should help make Ahmed Patel the CM?‚Äù

Rahul Gandhi meets Sushma Swaraj. (ANI)

Pakistan surprisingly reacted to Modi‚Äôs claim, saying India should fight its
internal elections on its not not by dragging the neighbouring country.

In his speech, PM Modi had also claimed that the meeting was attended by
former Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh. ‚ÄúThere were media reports
yesterday about a meeting at Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs house. It was attended by
Pakistan‚Äôs high commissioner, Pakistan‚Äôs former foreign minister, India‚Äôs
former vice president and former prime minister Manmohan Singh,‚Äù he added.

Singh himself later confirmed that the meeting had taken place at Aiyar‚Äôs
house. However, Gujarat election was not discussed in the meeting that was
also attended by a former Indian Army chief. Singh also issued a full-page
stinging reply to Modi, accusing him of spreading ‚Äúfalsehood‚Äù and canards‚Äù

‚ÄúI am deeply pained and anguished by the falsehood and canards being spread to
score political points in a lost cause by none less than Prime Minister Sh.
Narendra Modi. Fearing imminent defeat in Gujarat, desperation of Prime
Minister to hurl every abuse and latch on to every straw is palpable.
Sadly&amp;amp; regrettably, Sh Modi is setting a dangerous precedent by his
insatiable desire to tarnish every constitutional office, including that of a
Former Prime Minister and Army Chief,‚Äù Singh wrote.

**Don‚Äôt pay power bills, other dues to govt: Sharad Pawar to farmers** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| Nagpur |

Published: December 12, 2017 6:29 pm

Pawar also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù
misconstruing a meeting at the residence of suspended Congress leader Mani
Shankar Aiyar on December 6 and presenting it as a conspiracy by Pakistan to
interfere in the Gujarat polls.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar today asked farmers in Maharashtra not to pay
outstanding loan or dues like electricity bills to the government unless it
deposits the ‚Äúmuch-touted‚Äù loan waiver amount into their bank accounts.
Speaking at a public rally ‚Äî ‚ÄòHalla Bol‚Äô ‚Äî organised by the Congress and the
NCP here on the issues of agrarian crisis, Pawar said if the government is ‚Äúof
no use to people‚Äù, then people should not cooperate with it.

‚ÄúUnless the loan waiver amount is deposited into the bank accounts of farmers,
I appeal to the farming community not to pay any dues or even electricity
bills to the state government,‚Äù the former Union agriculture minister, who
turned 77 today, said.

The Maharashtra government had announced a mega agri loan waiver of Rs 34,022
crore on June 24 after a state-wide agitation by farmers. On July 9, Chief
Minister Devendra Fadnavis said around 36 lakh farmers in the state will have
their entire debt waived.

Pawar asked Fadnavis to ‚Äústay away‚Äù from ‚Äúblackmail politics‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe
Maharashtra chief minister uses the language of blackmailing the opposition.
We respect the mandate of the people who chose you to govern,‚Äù Pawar asserted.

‚ÄúBut if he thinks blackmailing is a part of people‚Äôs mandate to his
government, then he should remember that people can oust him from power.‚Äù
Speaking to reporters in Nagpur ahead of the winter session of state
legislature, which began on Monday, Fadnavis had said, ‚ÄúI have enough evidence
against the leaders of opposition and I will disclose it at the right time.‚Äù

Pawar also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù
misconstruing a meeting at the residence of suspended Congress leader Mani
Shankar Aiyar on December 6 and presenting it as a conspiracy by Pakistan to
interfere in the Gujarat polls.

‚ÄúShame on you Prime Minister for making such allegations! You have made the
allegations against this country‚Äôs former prime minister (Manmohan Singh) and
former defence officials,‚Äù Pawar, a former defence minister himself, said.

‚ÄúThe Modi government has not solved issues of farmers and other issues the
country faces, but he is bringing the Pakistan angle as a diversionary tactic
during the Gujarat elections,‚Äù Pawar said.

Modi has destroyed the country and belittled the office of the prime minister,
Pawar claimed.

**Who in India wears the sari?** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi:** A _New York Times _article published last month attracted widespread attention because of its claim that fashion in India was being driven by a nationalist agenda. The article by Asgar Qadri argued that India has witnessed a state-led promotion of traditional attire in general, and the sari in particular, as part of a broader attempt to ‚Äúproject multi-faith India as a Hindu nation‚Äù, ever since the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rose to power in 2014.

But the central premise of the article about the sari being a Hindu attire is
not backed by data. A _Mint_ analysis of data from the last round of the
consumer expenditure survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office
(NSSO) shows that the sari enjoys broad appeal across religious groups, with a
majority of Christian and Muslim households reporting buying at least one sari
in the year preceding the survey. This survey covering more than 100,000
households across the country was conducted in 2011-12, well before Modi
became India‚Äôs prime minister (_see chart 1_).

Overall, eight out of every 10 households in India reported purchasing at
least one sari. The share of households purchasing saris is higher in rural
India at 85%. In urban India, 74% households reported purchasing saris.

Among Sikhs, the share of households which bought saris is very low. But that
seems to have more to do with geography than with religion. Most Sikhs are
from Punjab, where the overall share of households purchasing saris is very
small.

The sari is almost universally popular in the south and parts of eastern
India, with an overwhelming majority of households reporting purchasing at
least one sari. It is far less popular in the north-western states, where the
overwhelming majority did not report the purchase of even one sari in the year
preceding the NSSO survey (_see chart 2_)

In fact, once we account for regional differences in sartorial preferences,
the differences in sari purchases across the two major religious groups‚ÄîHindus
and Muslims‚Äîalmost disappears. The share of Muslim households reporting
purchases of saris is high in states where the figure for Hindu households is
high and low in states where the figure for Hindu households is low, as the
scatter-plot shows (_see chart 3_).

Apart from the six in the fourth quadrant, all other states lie on either the
first or the third quadrant, indicating a broad linear relationship between
Hindu and Muslim consumption of saris.

The sari also nearly manages to breach the class divide in the country. The
share of households belonging to the top decile which reported purchasing a
sari at 77% was only slightly higher than the comparative figure for the
bottom decile (72%). But the poorer income classes spent proportionately more
on saris than the rich. The top and bottom deciles refer to the top 10% and
bottom 10% of households respectively, when ranked according to their overall
annual consumption expenditure (_see chart 4_)

The NSSO data also shows a sharp regional skew when it comes to other outfits
for women, such as skirts and kurta-pyjama suits. While the former is more
popular in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the country, the latter
seems to be more popular in the north and the west. In some northern states
such as Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, the share of households reporting the
purchase of the (female) kurta-pyjama suit is low. But that appears to be
because most households tend to purchase cloth for these items rather than
ready-made suits (_see chart 5 and chart 6_).

The class divide in the purchase of both these outfits is sharper than in the
case of the sari. 35% of households belonging to the top decile reported
purchasing a female kurta-pyjama suit but the comparative figure for the
bottom decile was much lower at 6%.

Similarly, the share of households belonging to the top decile which purchased
skirts (or frocks) at 27% was 15 percentage points higher than the share of
households belonging to the bottom decile which made similar purchases.

Overall, geography and wealth seem to have a far greater influence on the
sartorial choices of Indian women than religion.

_This is the first of a two-part series on what Indians wear. The second part
will examine the sartorial choices of Indian men._

**Air Deccan set to relaunch operations with Re1 flight tickets**

**New Delhi:** Air Deccan, India‚Äôs first domestic low cost airline, is set to relaunch operations this month with what it is remembered for the most‚ÄîRe1 airfares.

Air Deccan, founded by G.R. Gopinath in 2003, merged with Vijay Mallya‚Äôs
Kingfisher Airlines in 2008, which was grounded in 2012 under financial
duress.

In its second innings, the airline will begin with four bases at Mumbai,
Delhi, Kolkata and Shillong, connecting them with smaller cities around them.

The first Air Deccan flight will take off on 22 December and fly to Mumbai
from Nashik, Gopinath told _Mint_, speaking from his home in Bengaluru.

‚ÄúThis will be my last Udan and then I will hang up my boots,‚Äù said Gopinath,
who has been waiting for a re-entry for few years now.

The government‚Äôs Udan scheme (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik), which loosely
translates as ‚Äúlet the common man fly‚Äù and proposes to connect small towns on
fares of about Rs2,500 for a one-hour flight, has provided that entry for the
entrepreneur. Air Deccan, which has the tagline ‚ÄúSimplifly‚Äù, will brand its
entry with a ‚Äúthe common man takes to the skies‚Äù logo designed by cartoonist
the late R.K. Laxman.

‚ÄúSome of the initial lucky people will be able to get Re1 fares also,‚Äù
Gopinath said, even though most tickets will start at about Rs1,400 for a
40-minute Nashik-Mumbai flight, a distance that would take four hours to cover
by road.

Air Deccan will also operate daily return flights between Nashik and Pune and
Mumbai and Jalgaon.

By January, the airline plans to station a second aircraft in Delhi to connect
the city with Agra, Shimla, Ludhiana, Pantnagar, Dehradun and Kullu.

Air Deccan will also station two planes in Kolkata, flying them to Jamshedpur,
Rourkela, Durgapur, Bagdogra, Burnpur, Cooch Behar, Agartala, and from
Shillong to Imphal, Dimapur, Aizawl and Agartala. It will use 19-seater Beech
1900 D planes that are used worldwide. Three of these planes have already
joined its fleet and two more will be added over the next few weeks, according
to Gopinath.

By January, four planes will be used for services and one will be kept on
standby.

Gopinath said he would like to expand faster, but is not getting slots and
parking at the congested Mumbai and Delhi airports and flying to airports on
the outskirts would ruin the small airline even before it has taken its first
baby steps. Initially, the airline was not granted even one slot at these
airports and it took several requests made to the aviation ministry before a
few slots were given, said Gopinath.

Smaller planes are exempt from paying any fee and therefore don‚Äôt bring
revenue to the airport.

‚ÄúThe private sector airport monopolies are not aligned to the vision of Prime
Minister Narendra Modi and the steps being taken by aviation ministry in
making Udan a success,‚Äù Gopinath said, adding, ‚ÄúThey say we can give three
slots per week for Kolhapur-Bombay. Do you think someone who goes by plane
will like to come by train the next day?‚Äù

An email seeking comment from the Mumbai airport remained unanswered till the
time of going to press. A Delhi airport spokesman said to support Udan, the
airport has offered 26 slots to four airlines. Air Deccan had requested for a
total of 10 slots, out of which 6 slots have already been offered to the
airline. ‚ÄúIn addition, 4 post-midnight slots have also been offered. However,
Air Deccan is yet to finalize their schedule,‚Äù it added.

‚ÄúIndia presents such a big market with so many different levels of airports
that you need a turboprop to address a good part of the regional market,‚Äù
former Jet Airways chief executive Steve Forte said, adding, ‚ÄúThe government
should have some guidelines for airports to provide for regional
connectivity.‚Äù

**'Karachi' Detail Fuels More Buzz Over PM Modi's Seaplane Ride In Gujarat** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi took a seaplane to a temple in Gujarat's Mehsana on Tuesday.

**New Delhi: **

The seaplane that turned into a spectacular ride for Prime Minister Narendra
Modi on the last day of campaigning on Tuesday for the Gujarat election, came
to India from Karachi on December 3 - a detail that was enough to stoke
critics in the middle of a massive row over a dinner attended by Congress
leaders and Pakistani guests last week.

According to flight-tracking website UK.Flightaware.com, the seaplane, a Quest
Kodiak 100 operated by a foreign pilot, made a pit-stop at Karachi earlier
this month. From there, it took off on December 3 and landed the same day in
Mumbai, from where it flew to Ahmedabad on Monday.

The single-engine seaplane is reportedly privately-owned and has the US
registration number N181KQ. John Goulet, the pilot who flew the seaplane,
described his VIP rider as ""a very good passenger"".

PM Modi took off in the seaplane from the river Sabarmati and landed at the
Dharoi Dam, about 180 km away.

The 35-minute ride, organised after the Prime Minister's roadshow in Ahmedabad
was cancelled over police concerns, was fodder for the opposition, which
alleged that security rules had been violated.

The security rule-book says the Prime Minister can only fly in twin or multi-
engine aircraft.

Rahul Gandhi, the Congress's president-designate, called the seaplane ride ""a
distraction from key questions,"" adding that ""the real question is what did
you do for Gujarat in 22 years.""

The Karachi detail drew comments on social media, which has been abuzz with
acrimonious sparring over a dinner at suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar
Aiyar's home, in which guests included former prime minister Manmohan Singh,
other Congress leaders, and Pakistanis including former foreign minister
Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri.

""&amp;amp; Why Was A #Seaplane That Travelled From Karachi Doing Rounds For Our PM
@narendramodi Ji,"" was a tweet from the handle @INCTelangana

Shaktisinh Gohil was among the multiple Congress leaders who shared media
reports on Twitter.

At a public rally in Gujarat on Sunday, PM Modi suggested that the election
was discussed at Mr Aiyar's dinner, and hinted at a conspiracy between the
Congress and Pakistan to defeat the BJP, which has ruled Gujarat for 22 years.

The PM's allegation has been rubbished as outrageous by the Congress and
Manmohan Singh responded with an unusually cutting statement asking Mr Modi to
apologise for ""falsehoods and canards"".

**Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs interview to Gujarati channel: BJP wants EC to take cognizance, Cong says stop threatening journalists**

In the run-up to Gujarat elections, a war of words broke out between BJP and
Congress over Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs interview to a local Gujarati channel. Arguing
that the interview was a part of Congress‚Äô election campaign, Railway Minister
Piyush Goyal attacked Congress President-elect for allegedly violating the
Representation of the People Act, 1951. ‚ÄúIt was not permitted to give an
interview in the last 48 hours of campaigning in Gujarat. I am sure the
Election Commission will take cognizance of this and take an action,‚Äù he was
quoted as saying by the ANI. The second phase of Gujarat polls will take place
on December 14.

Congress in retaliation accused BJP of using ‚ÄúEC as a tool for its political
gains.‚Äù Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala
accused BJP of allegedly threatening journalists. ‚ÄúWhen Congress President-
elect Rahul Gandhi gave interviews to a few Gujarati news channels, BJP, in
the name of Election Commission, threatened to jail the journalists of those
channels for broadcasting it. We condemn this arrogant behavior of BJP,‚Äù he
said.

Reacting to the complaint filed by the BJP, BB Swain, Chief Electoral Officer
of Gujarat elections said, ‚ÄúWe have got a complaint regarding telecast of an
interview. We have collected the DVDs. We will be doing due examination &amp;amp;
look into whether it has violated Rules 126 RP Act or not.‚Äù According to
Representation of the People Act, 1951, section 126, public meetings are
barred during the period of forty-eight hours before the elections.

Gandhi in an interview to Gujarat Samachar TV said, ‚ÄúThis election is not
about Rahul Gandhi or Narendra Modi. This is about the voice of Gujarat. They
are not talking about real issues. There is no talk about Gujarat‚Äôs vikas.
Instead, they insulted Manmohan Singh.‚Äù

He also continued his attack against PM Modi over GST, demonetisation and also
accused the party of evading important questions related to the development of
Gujarat. On his temple visits, he said, ‚ÄúAm I not allowed to visit temples?
People from the BJP keep talking about this issue unnecessarily because they
are scared and they don‚Äôt want to talk about real issues. PM Modi‚Äôs not afraid
of Rahul Gandhi, he‚Äôs afraid of the people of Gujarat.‚Äù He also accused BJP of
distorting his image. ‚ÄúThere is no makeover in me. I am just speaking the
truth and now people are able to see the reality.‚Äù

**PM Modi has met two of my demands on GSTN, says Subramanian Swamy**

Express Photo by Prem Nath Pandey. 20.02.2017.

BJP leader Subramanian Swamy Wednesday claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi
has met two of his demands regarding permitting CAG to audit GSTN, the company
providing the IT backbone of the GST regime, and the MHA investigating it for
national security compliance.

‚ÄúTwo of my demands were met by the Prime Minister. One, to permit Comptroller
and Auditor General of India (CAG) to audit Goods and Services Tax Network
(GSTN) and two, to ask Ministry of Home Affairs to investigate GSTN for
national security compliance,‚Äù he told PTI.

GSTN, a not-for-profit private limited company, is providing the technology
backbone for the collection of taxes and filing of returns in the new indirect
tax regime and Infosys has developed the software for the same.

The company had won a Rs 1,380 crore deal in 2015 in this regard. In a letter
to Modi last August, Swamy had raised strong objections to a majority stake
for private entities in the company formed during the UPA regime to manage and
control the accounting and collection of GST.

He had also urged Modi to ensure that it is replaced by a government-owned
structure.

Swamy, a Rajya Sabha member, had also asked Modi to subject GSTN to a ‚Äúclose
second look‚Äù and ‚Äúthorough scrutiny‚Äù, questioning how a private entity can be
allowed access to ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù information without security clearance. Replying
to a query, Swamy said he was waiting for probe reports, but did not reveal
the timeline Prime Minister has fixed for submissions.

‚ÄúI am waiting for probe reports,‚Äù he said.

In an interview to a news portal in April this year, Swamy had said he would
challenge GSTN as ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù in court as it violates his fundamental
rights. Swamy said, ‚ÄúSince I am waiting for probe reports, till then, no court
action.‚Äù

**PM Narendra Modi's Seaplane Ride Can Lead To Disqualification Of BJP Candidates: Congress Leader** 

 ______ 
Gujarat Assembly Election 2017: PM Modi took off in a seaplane from the
Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad.

**Panaji: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's seaplane ride on Tuesday in Gujarat could lead
to disqualification of BJP candidates due to overshooting of the poll expenses
limit, Goa Congress President Shantaram Naik said.

""Modi's seaplane ride to the Dharoi dam in Mehsana district may lead to
disqualification of BJP candidates since the expenditure borne on such rides
is not exempted under the Representation of the People Act and has to be
included as travel expense of a 'star campaigner',"" Mr Naik said in a
statement in Panaji.

""The expenses on the seaplane ride needs to be included in poll expenses of
respective BJP candidates, which will only get them disqualified for crossing
the legal limit of expenditure, thanks to Modi,"" Mr Naik said.

The expenditure limit for Lok Sabha elections in the bigger states is Rs 70
lakh for each constituency.

He said the ride in any case cannot be treated as ""travel"" within the meaning
of the electoral laws.

On Tuesday, PM Modi flew in the seaplane from Sabarmati ashram in Ahmedabad to
the dam.

**Bad loans to banks by UPA a scam bigger than 2G, CWG, coal block scandals: Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on the previous
Congress-led UPA regime, saying that banks were pressured to give loans worth
thousands of crores of rupees to select industrialists in a scam bigger than
2G, coal and Commonwealth Games scandals.

Speaking at the 90th AGM of industry association Ficci, Modi said the non
performing asset (NPA) or bad loans problem is a ‚Äúliability‚Äù handed over by
‚Äúeconomists‚Äù in the previous regime.

Hard-selling his government‚Äôs pro-poor policies, he listed out initiatives
like free cooking gas connections to women, bank accounts to every household,
loans to the youth and affordable housing, taken since 2014.

Modi said loans extended to select industrialists by pressuring banks was a
loot of public money.

Calling it a ‚Äúscam‚Äù, he said this was bigger than the Commonwealth Games, 2G
telecom spectrum allocation and coal block allocation scams.

Modi said his government is formulating policies keeping in mind the need of
businesses, abolishing archaic and obsolete laws.

Industry, he said, had been long demanding Goods and Services Tax (GST) and
the BJP-led government implemented it and introduced measures like anti-
profiteering to see that industry passes on the benefit of lower taxes to the
people.

More than 30 crore poor have got bank accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana, Modi
said, adding that a study has found that inflation had come down in rural
areas where such accounts have been opened.

He said 87 important reforms in sectors including in defence, financial sector
and food processing have been taken up in the last three years.

The government has attempted to frame policies keeping in mind the aspirations
and needs of the people, he said.

More than 3 crore women have been given free cooking gas LPG connection. After
this, fuel inflation has dropped in rural areas, he said.

‚ÄúWe are trying to solve problems of poor after identifying their problems‚Äù, he
said.

Under the Mudra scheme, over Rs 4 lakh crore guarantee- less loans have been
given to about 9.75 lakh youth for business, leading to 3 crore new
entrepreneurs being created since launch, he said.

**Manmohan Singh reiterates demand for PM Modi‚Äôs apology, Amit Shah questions his sudden ‚Äòanger‚Äô**

Manmohan Singh said Prime Minister Modi, fearing ‚Äòimminent defeat‚Äô in Gujarat,
was spreading ‚Äòfalsehoods‚Äô and ‚Äòcanards‚Äô. (Express photo)

In what seemed a ploy by the Congress to score brownie points just a day ahead
of second phase of Gujarat elections, the party released a video of former
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday where he reiterated his demand for
an apology from Narendra Modi over his charge that the Grand Old Party was
colluding with Pakistan to defeat the BJP.

In his statement, Singh said Prime Minister Modi, fearing ‚Äúimminent defeat‚Äù in
Gujarat, was spreading ‚Äúfalsehoods‚Äù and ‚Äúcanards‚Äù and was setting a dangerous
precedent by his ‚Äúinsatiable desire‚Äù to ‚Äútarnish‚Äù every Constitutional office.

The reason behind releasing the video was obvious to one and all, prompting
BJP chief Amit Shah to launch a counter attack. Shah asked why was the former
PM silent when Modi was called ‚Äúneech‚Äù and when Rahul Gandhi tore an ordinance
in 2013. ‚ÄúWhy was Manmohan Singh silent when PM of his country was called
‚Äòneech‚Äô. Where was his anger when Rahul Gandhi tore an ordinance passed by his
Cabinet? Where was his concern for dignity of PMO then,‚Äù the BJP chief asked.

When Singh had first spoken against the PM on Monday, most of the BJP brass,
including Modi himself and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley came out to counter
him, laying bare the importance the party attached to the former PM‚Äôs
statement. On Wednesday, Shah said the country missed Singh‚Äôs ‚Äúanger‚Äù when
corruption happened under his watch. ‚ÄúManmohan Singh is very angry these days.
But the nation missed his anger when monumental loot happened under his
watch,‚Äù PTI quoted Shah as saying.

Singh‚Äôs hard-hitting statement was in response to the Prime Minister‚Äôs
reference at an election rally in Gujarat on Sunday to a ‚Äúsecret meeting‚Äù held
on December 6 at Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar‚Äôs residence to allege
Pakistan‚Äôs hand in the Gujarat elections. Former Pakistan Foreign Minister
Khurshid Kasuri, Pakistan High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood and former
Army Chief Deepak Kapoor were among those at the meeting.

In an uncharacteristic attack on Modi, the former Prime Minister asked him to
‚Äúshow the maturity and gravitas expected of the high office he holds‚Äù and
apologise for his ‚Äúill thought transgression‚Äù to restore the dignity of the
office he occupies. ‚ÄúI reject the innuendos and falsehoods as I did not
discuss Gujarat elections with anyone else at the dinner hosted by Aiyar as
alleged by Modi. Nor was the Gujarat issue raised by anyone else present at
the dinner. The discussion was confined to India-Pakistan relations,‚Äù Singh
reiterated on Wednesday.

**Dont give damn about EC, says Gujarat BJP MLA talking about PM Narendra Modi rally, Commission issues notice** 

 ______ 
## Highlights

  * _1_

Viral video clip shows BJP MLA saying he does not give a ""damn"" about the EC.

  * _2_

The MLA says this while asking supporters to ensure good crowd presence at a
PM Modi event.

  * _3_

The Election Commission has sent him a showcause notice.

A Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Gujarat has landed himself in the cross-
hairs of the Election Commission after a viral video showed him saying he does
not ""give a damn"" about the EC or its sacrosanct poll code, currently in
effect in the state, which will vote in the second and last phase of voting
tomorrow.

Bhushan Bhatt - the MLA in question - has been issued a showcase notice after
the Election Commission came across the video clips in which he exhorts a
group of what seems to be BJP supporters to ensure a strong crowd at Prime
Minister Narendra Modi's Sabarmati Riverfront event.

The event was held yesterday, which the last day of campaigning for the
Gujarat Assembly election. PM Modi visited the iconic riverfront in Ahmedabad
from where he took a seaplane to Dharoi Dam in Mehsana.

In the clip, whose authenticity was not verified by IndiaToday.in, Bhatt can
be heard saying - in Gujarati - that he does not give a ""damn"" about the EC as
he tells the gathered supporters to get people on bikes and cars to attend PM
Modi's Sabarmati Riverfront address in Ahmedabad.

He is also heard suggesting that the petrol/diesel expenses of the supporters
will be taken care of.

Taking cognizance of the video, the Election Commission issued a showcause
notice to Bhatt, who is an MLA from the Jamalpur Khadia constituency in
Ahmedabad.

Jamalpur Khadia, along with the rest of Ahmedabad - a BJP stronghold, will
vote tomorrow as Gujarat holds the second and final phase of polling for its
182-member Assembly. Results will be announced on Monday, December 18.

**EC issues show cause notice to Rahul Gandhi for interview to Gujarati channel** 

 ______ 
The Election Commission on Wednesday directed the Chief Electoral Officer of
Gujarat to register FIR against all the media houses for airing interview of
Congress president-elect Rahul Gandhi which was given in alleged violation of
the Representation of the People Act. The EC said that all the TV channels
which are violating the provisions of Section 126(1)(b) have been directed to
stop airing the interview immediately. It also issued a show cause notice to
Gandhi and asked him to reply by December 18.

After Gandhi targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his interview, the BJP
had attacked the new Congress chief saying he was not even permitted to give
an interview in the last 48 hours of campaigning in Gujarat. ‚ÄúIt was not
permitted to give an interview in the last 48 hours of campaigning in Gujarat.
I am sure the Election Commission will take cognizance of this and take an
action,‚Äù senior BJP leader and union minister Piyush Goyal said.

Congress in retaliation accused BJP of using ‚ÄúEC as a tool for its political
gains.‚Äù Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala
accused BJP of allegedly threatening journalists. ‚ÄúWhen Congress President-
elect Rahul Gandhi gave interviews to a few Gujarati news channels, BJP, in
the name of Election Commission, threatened to jail the journalists of those
channels for broadcasting it. We condemn this arrogant behavior of BJP,‚Äù he
said.

Gandhi in an interview to Gujarat Samachar TV said, ‚ÄúThis election is not
about Rahul Gandhi or Narendra Modi. This is about the voice of Gujarat. They
are not talking about real issues. There is no talk about Gujarat‚Äôs vikas.
Instead, they insulted Manmohan Singh.‚Äù

He also continued his attack against PM Modi over GST, demonetisation and also
accused the party of evading important questions related to the development of
Gujarat.

The second phase of Gujarat polls will take place on December 14.

Even if you compromise OTP chips at OEMs, what about independent audit/testing of various poll agents, belonging to all participating parties in election, in remote locations and in public? Also which EVM will go to which booth is also very transparent process and is done by/like randomized lottery. Also what about the presiding officials, they aren't handful of guys. Minimum 3 to 5 people per booth per EVM accompanied by many polling agents and media persons.

Now with the advent of VVPAT, you can always audit paper trails and whether or not they tally with machine data? Mass scale rigging is a far fetched notion, IMO. Even if people in govt do try (data suggests EVMs are mostly anti incumbent so they haven't) they will get caught!


Paper ballots are not good. People in power can manipulate those. Declaring votes invalid. Creating Logistic problems etc. Election related malpractices have been reduced drastically thanks to EVMs. So much so that netas goes extra mile to woe (or mislead) voters now a days.

#1. Compromise the firmware going into all EVMs such that, say, every 10th vote is assigned to a particular number not on the list, say (Entry 50). This would involve bribing very few people.

#2. Compromise the firmware of going into the counting machines such that all votes assigned to (Entry 50) are re-assigned to another entry, say (Entry 5). This, again, would require bribing very few people.

#3. Make sure your party/candidate gets to be listed as (Entry 5) on the counting machines at places where a ~10% swing would make a difference between winning and losing a seat. Since the counting process is centralized and non-transparent: this, again, can be done by bribing a handful of people.

(Note: I am not exactly sure how the counting process takes place. Even if it is different than how I have assumed it to be, minor tweaks to the third step, depending upon how the counting process is carried out, will lead to the same result.)

This should not be misconstrued to mean that all elections involving EVMs are necessarily compromised. I'm *not* saying that.

The case being made here is that compromising electronic voting is simpler and less expensive and less obvious than manipulating paper ballots.

To manipulate a paper ballot, you would necessarily have to disrupt polling at a very large number of polling booths and involve thousands of people, at least, in the process. Plus, the whole process would be blatantly obvious.

&gt; Now with the advent of VVPAT, you can always audit paper trails and whether or not they tally with machine data? 

Yes. Personally, I think EVMs + VVPATs are safe enough. Objectively speaking, they are still less secure than paper ballots.

Counting paper ballots are cumbersome and votes can easily be miscounted, ballots misplaced, etc. Using paper ballots for elections that involve a billion people may not be very efficient. I'm not sure if I'd be in favour of going back to paper ballots. However, in terms of security, paper ballots are still the most secure. Acknowledging that and the deficiencies of electronic voting allows us to remain more vigilant to cases of electoral malpractice.

&gt; Paper ballots are not good. People in power can manipulate those. Declaring votes invalid. Creating Logistic problems etc. Election related malpractices have been reduced drastically thanks to EVMs

Yes. Paper ballots can be manipulated too. But (i)it will need to involve a lot of people, and (ii)the manipulation will always be obvious.

With EVMs, the deception is both easier to carry out and easier to hide.

&gt; Why would Modi take such a risk if he can rig EVMs? 

I have no idea! This post isn't about Modi or any particular political party. Just a comparison of paper ballots vs EVMs. Any party, even companies with vested interests, can try to compromise the elections. 

Perhaps he is afraid EVMs will be manipulated against his party. :P

It's important to note that *any* party can try to manipulate EVMs and it will be easier for them to do that than trying to manipulate paper ballots. The INC, the BJP, and other regional parties are *all* equally capable of carrying it out.",2017-12-14 01:34:13

**What is INS Kalvari?** 

 ______ 
By:

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Published: December 14, 2017 8:38 am

The submarine will be commissioned by PM Narendra Modi on Thursday.

INS Kalvari, a potent Man o‚Äô War capable of undertaking offensive operations
will be commissioned into the Indian Navy at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai on
Thursday. The first of the six Scorpene-class submarines is regarded as a very
prestigious acquisition which embodies cutting edge technology and compares
favourably with the best in the world. The construction of the Submarine,
designated as MDL Yard 11875, commenced with the first cutting of steel at MDL
on December 14, 2006. The ‚ÄòBoot Together‚Äô of the submarine wherein the five
separate sections were welded into one was completed on July 30, 2014.
Interestingly, she is the first Indian Naval vessel to be built using this
modular approach of construction.

Touted to be the most capable weapon in Navy‚Äôs hold, the submarine has an
overall length of 67.5 metres and a height of about 12.3 metres. The hull
form, the fin and the hydroplanes are specifically designed to produce minimum
underwater resistance. Her 360 battery cells (each weighing 750 kg) power the
extremely silent Permanently Magnetised Propulsion Motor. Her stealth is
further enhanced through the mounting of equipment inside the pressure hull on
shock absorbing cradles.

Another thing that makes Kalvari a potent weapon is the the boat‚Äôs undersea
warfare capability that comprises of a cluster of advanced weapons and sensors
integrated into the Submarine Tactical Integrated Combat System (SUBTICS). The
sonar suite is Low Frequency Analysis and Ranging (LOFAR) capable enabling
long rage detection and classification. Post classification, she may choose to
engage the enemy by utilising either the sea skimming SM 39 EXOCET missiles
(Flying Fish in French) or the heavy weight wire guided Surface and Underwater
Target (SUT) torpedoes. Towards self-defence, she is fitted with mobile C303/S
anti-torpedo decoys.

The submarine‚Äôs attack and search periscopes are equipped with Infrared/Low
Light Level cameras and Laser Range finders. The boat also has her two 1250 kW
MAN Diesel Engines for rapidly charging batteries. The submarine boasts of a
highly advanced Combat Management System and a sophisticated Integrated
Platform Management System.

INS Kalvari was hauled out on Pontoon from the East Yard Dry Dock of MDL in
the presence of the then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on April 06, 2015.
The submarine was ‚Äòlaunched‚Äô and christened as ‚ÄòKalvari‚Äô on October 27, 2015.

**Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs LPG scheme for poor running out of gas** 

 ______ 
Smoke from her wood-fired chulha reflected the helplessness and anger swirling
inside Jarina Begum, cooking for her family of eight in a neighbour‚Äôs
courtyard in eastern Uttar Pradesh.

The woman in Dubari village of Mau district shouldn‚Äôt be using a clay hearth
and burning firewood. She has a stovetop, a cooking gas cylinder and the
government‚Äôs blessings in the form of a subsidy that gets debited into her
bank account every time she buys a refill.

But Begum and husband Noor Alam, a cart-puller earning about Rs 6,000 a month,
are too poor to pay the subsidised price for a refill. ‚ÄúHumare sar par chhat
nahee hai, gas ka paisa kahaan se laayen (where do we get money to buy cooking
gas when we don‚Äôt have a roof over our head)?‚Äù asked the mother of six whose
mud-and-thatch hut was destroyed by a thunderstorm.

Her fate belies the momentary stardom thrust on the family last year. And it
reflects the distance between well-meaning policy and practice.

Begum was selected along with nine more women to be the country‚Äôs first
recipients of the central government‚Äôs cooking gas scheme for people living
below the poverty line.

Called the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), Prime Minister Narendra Modi
launched the Rs 8,000-crore project in UP‚Äôs Ballia on May 1, 2016, with an aim
to provide 50 million free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to women
in poor households over three years. Ujjwala was an instant hit and more than
30 million connections were given in the first 19 months.

Begum and her husband were flown to New Delhi to meet the petroleum and
natural gas minister. They had a paid-for holiday of their lifetime in the
national capital for three days.

Back home, the couple‚Äôs ordeal didn‚Äôt change. The family continued to struggle
for each meal. There was never any question of saving money to rebuild their
rain-ruined hut. In the last eight months, Begum has bought just two refills.

‚ÄúHumara mazak bana diya hai ‚Ä¶ humey plane mein Dilli lekar gaye, itna paisa
kharcha kiya. Sarkari afsar aaye, humara video banaya ‚Ä¶ gas lagney ke baad
Jarina ki zindagi badal gayi ‚Ä¶ Koi aakar dekh hee nahi raha hai ki hum aaj
kaisey guzara kar rahen hain ‚Ä¶ Itnee mehngi gas bharwaney ka paisa kahaan se
layen?‚Äù she snapped, stirring the broth pot.

[They have reduced us to a joke. They spent so much, took us to Delhi in a
plane. Government officials came, made our video. Jarina‚Äôs life changed after
we got a gas connection. But now, nobody takes notice of how we are living. We
don‚Äôt have the money to refill such costly gas.]

Reporters, television crews and officials thronged Alam‚Äôs modest home after
the launch of the cooking gas scheme. The trickle continued even after their
house was damaged, prompting Satinder Singh of Shaheed Paras Indane Gas
Service, the area‚Äôs LPG dealer, to build the single-room with an asbestos roof
for the family.

In a corner of the room sits the prized gas stove, but without fuel in the
cylinder.

A similar ordeal has besieged Guddi Devi of Jigni Khas village in Ballia
district ‚Äî another chosen first recipient. Devi is back to using an earthen
chulha, burning cow-dung cakes, kept next to a dual-burner LPG stove in the
kitchen.

She uses the stove sparingly to save fuel: for quick snacks or tea for guests,
but not for daily cooking. Devi has taken just two refills in 2017.

Pradesh. (Arvind Gupta/HT Photo)

‚ÄúEmergency mein gas use kartey hain, khaana to lakdi pe hee banatey hain (we
use the gas stove during emergencies, but do everyday cooking in the wood-
fired hearth),‚Äù said Renu Chaurasia of Garwar village.

The Chaurasias have taken only three refills since they got an Ujjwala
connection in December 2016.

The majority of poor households took a stove and the first LPG cylinder on a
loan of around Rs 1,500 offered with the scheme. They have to pay the market
price for LPG cylinders till the loan is repaid. It‚Äôs tough for these families
to pay the subsidised price, let alone buy cylinders at the market price,
which is Rs 819 in Ballia. That is around Rs 334 more than the current post-
subsidy price of Rs 485.

Devi‚Äôs gas agency, Pragya Indane Gramin Vitrak in Garwar, has around 2,300
Ujjwala connections. It registers about 20% refills a month from these
beneficiaries.

‚ÄúWith the rising cost of LPG and alternative cooking options in rural areas,
even refills in regular LPG connections are not registering 50% sales. Though
the subsidy amount is credited directly in the user‚Äôs bank accounts, it is
difficult for poor households to spare Rs 800 at the time of buying refills,‚Äù
said Vimal Gupta, the proprietor of Pragya Indane.

The dismal rate of refills raises questions. The government and oil marketing
companies have succeeded in rapidly expanding LPG coverage among poor
households, but these are not translating into a surge in LPG consumption.

In 2016-17, of the 3.22 crore new LPG connections, 2 crore were PMUY
beneficiaries. While the rate of growth in LPG consumers on a year-on-year
basis jumped to 16.2% in 2016-17 from 10.2% in 2015-16, the rate of growth in
LPG consumption rose by just 80 basis points to 9.8% from 9% in 2015-16.

The three-year average price of a subsidised LPG cylinder is about Rs 429.
Assuming that a cylinder lasts six weeks, the median number of cylinders used
by households with LPG as primary fuel would be nine cylinders a year. And a
family would have to spend Rs 429 every six weeks for a refill. That‚Äôs big
money for poor families.

‚ÄúFor most Ujjwala consumers, food and education come first and cooking and
health come next. The rise in LPG prices is deterring them from taking refills
‚Ä¶ from Rs 597.50 in August to Rs 814 in November,‚Äù said Rajesh Kumar Gautam,
president of LPG Association, Ballia.

The mindset of the poor is to use one cylinder over three to four months.

The 4,23,024 regular LPG connections in Ballia are clocking in refills at the
rate of 60-70% a month, while 95,815 Ujjwala connections are registering just
25-30% refills a month, says Gautam.

Abhishek Jain, senior programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and
Water, says while Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojanais a step in the right
direction it would be useful to know how the sustained use of the fuel is
evolving. ‚ÄúAs per the 2011 census, while 53% of households in India had an LPG
connection, only 28% used it as the primary source of cooking. This implies
that despite paying for the connection, over half of the households having LPG
were not using it as their primary cooking fuel,‚Äù says Jain.

The petroleum and natural gas ministry hails the scheme as a big success, but
does not give details on the average number of refills or broader consumption
patterns. Several emails to the ministry asking for refill data remained
unanswered despite repeated reminders.

Dharmendra Pradhan, minister, petroleum and natural gas, while inaugurating
the India chapter of Women in LPG last week said, ‚ÄúWe have studied the first
year consumption pattern and have found that about 60 per cent of the
beneficiaries on an average bought four refills. This is a very encouraging
trend and we hope the number will increase in future.‚Äô‚Äô

The NITI Aayog‚Äôs India Energy Security Scenario 2017 predicts that 35% of
rural households will still be reliant on biomass for cooking by 2032.

It‚Äôs not hard to guess why. The family of Guddi Devi has three school-going
children and finds it difficult to spare Rs 819 for an LPG cylinder. But dung
cakes come free, with two cows in the backyard.

**India to commission its first new conventional submarine after 17 years** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: ""Sea denial"" is the name of the game for conventional diesel-
electric submarines. Their primary role is to interdict an enemy's trade and
energy routes, block its ports, sink its warships, and sometimes attack land
targets with long-range cruise missiles.

Nuclear-powered submarines armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles,
called SSBNs in naval parlance, of course, are all about strategic deterrence.
While India took a major step forward to complete its nuclear weapons triad by
commissioning its first small

SSBN

called INS Arihant last year, to add to the existing Agni land missiles and
fighter-bombers, its old and depleting conventional underwater combat arm has
been a huge worry for the last several years.

So, when PM

Narendra Modi

commissions India's first new diesel-electric submarine in over 17 years in
Mumbai on Thursday, it will be a red-letter day for the beleaguered

Navy

. The force, after all, is grappling with just 13 ageing conventional
submarines, only half of them operational at any given time.

The new 1,565-tonne submarine, named

INS Kalvari+

(tiger shark, a deadly deep-sea predator) after the first-ever submarine
inducted by India from Russia in December 1967, is to be followed by five of
her Scorpene sisters under the Rs 23,652 crore ""Project-75"" underway at
Mazagon Docks in collaboration with France.

The Scorpene project, of course, has faced huge time and cost overruns after
the contract with French shipbuilder DCNS (the Naval Group) was inked way back
in October 2005.

INS Kalvari, for instance, was to be ready by 2012, with the other five coming
by 2017. Now, the second one

INS Khanderi

will be commissioned by mid-2018, with the third INS Karanj following by
early-2019. All the six will be inducted by 2020-2021 now.

""It's better late than never. INS Kalvari is the most potent platform to have
been constructed in India, capable as it is of undertaking offensive
operations spanning the entire spectrum of maritime warfare,"" said an officer.

The submarine, which has a speed of 20 knots, is equipped with sea-skimming
SM-39 Exocet missiles and heavy-weight wire-guided surface and underwater
target torpedoes. ""The submarine has superior stealth and the ability to
launch a crippling attack on the enemy using precision-guided weapons,"" said
another officer.

Even as it pops the bubbly for INS Kalvari, the Navy is also keen to kick-
start the long-delayed ""Project-75-India"" for construction of six new stealth
submarines, with both land-attack missile capabilities and air-independent
propulsion for greater underwater endurance. ""We hopeful of beginning the
project by end-2018,"" said Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba.

Four global ship-builders ‚Äî Naval Group-DCNS (France), ThyssenKrupp Marine
Systems (Germany), Rosoboronexport Rubin Design Bureau (Russia) and Saab
Kockums (Sweden) ‚Äî have responded to the initial RFI (request for information)
issued by the Navy for this project estimated to be over Rs 60,000 crore.

Under P-75I, which was accorded ""acceptance of necessity"" in November 2007, a
foreign collaborator will be selected to tie-up with a domestic shipyard under
the ""strategic partnership"" policy. It will take seven to eight years after
the contract is inked for the first submarine to roll out.

India needs at least 18 diesel-electric and six nuclear attack submarines,
backed by four SSBNs armed with long-range ballistic missiles, to guard
against the two-front threat scenario from China and Pakistan as well as
achieve credible nuclear deterrence.

As far as credit is concerned I already invested in a house there before the 15% foreign tax came into effect and will buy a car as soon as I‚Äôm there along with a credit card for all expenses besides that. It‚Äôll take some time but credit will build.

Rahi baat compliances ki. I will gladly do everything that country says. Why you ask? Because I‚Äôm getting a shit load in return from the govt and I don‚Äôt have to worry about a babu coming over holding my business hostage. 

I‚Äôll give you an example. I wasn‚Äôt registered with the pollution authority in india. Then I thought chalo let‚Äôs do this compliance also. Did it. Invested in all the proper machinery etc. the babu takes 20k per year just to not create some ruckus on some caveat somewhere which can stop production. 

One more example out of many. A babu in the income tax Dept straight up demanded 50k to make a 5k error go away. An error caused by their backtrack on a certain policy. I said I will go to tribunal if you fuck with me. He straight off said to my face, sir aap kaam karoge ya you‚Äôll go to the tribunal hearings and then even I will appeal it if you get in your favour. Their attitude is like modi in Godhra. Kar lo jo karna hai. My dad having been through it said beta jao pay kar do because I‚Äôve been through the process and in end I wasted more money and still had to pay the babu. 

In india as long as you are under the radar you are rewarded with no hassle. Imagine an inspector entering Seelampur to hassle a business. Lol

Fully compliant yet not compliant that is the story in every sphere of Indian industry because the laws are such that a babu will come and ask for something. 

The other day the water bill for my factory came to 20k I said you added a zero by mistake in meter reading.  Sir aap 2k dedo I‚Äôll fix it. I sent my peon over five times with dated pics of meter and got it rectified but it cost me more. Next month they sent for 800 . now the deal is if it crosses a limit next month from this (which it will as they will add last months in the new bill) the cost goes up exponentially. So next month I would‚Äôve had to pay penalty if I hadn‚Äôt noticed it. these are the petty games we play with indian bureaucracy. 

In Canada there is a level playing field. All have to be compliant. Inspector comes and if he notices something gives you a one month notice and you can upload compliance pics to their site. Finished. 

Was thinking of getting registered with ESI. Thank god that demonetisation happened and gutted my industry. Opened my eyes to what a shitty fucked up country india is where you work to feed the moochers. 

Again coming to labour. My plant in Canada will be run by 4 people who work mon to sat and 9 to 5. With one month total off in a year. I will guarantee you it will still have more production than what I pay my 20 people who work here from 9 to 8:30 7 days a week with Sunday half day. Then shadi in village, dhan cutting in village, ram Naumi Diwali Vishkarma ye bhasund woh bhasund. No warning. Hindus have fucking so many gods and their birthdays there is no limit. Labour I feel is the biggest chutiyap in this country. 

Also indian is not a race. So racism doesn‚Äôt come into the pic. I‚Äôm talking about the collective shitty attitude that pervades our life just because we are surrounded by such idiots. In Canada I love the former Indians who have shed that attitude and are living an awesome life due to that.

**A few nefarious Pakistani thoughts**

Let it be said in fairness to Modi that he isn‚Äôt the first leader and will
certainly not be the last to invoke a ‚Äòforeign hand‚Äô for reasons of domestic
politicking. Almost every leader in the Subcontinent has done it.
(Illustration: C R Sasikumar)

During my reporting days in the Nineties, every six months or so, I would come
across an identical news report, tucked in some corner of the back pages of
one or the other Urdu newspaper informing us that RAW (R&amp;amp;AW) had
infiltrated haseen do-sheezaen (femme fatale) into Pakistan for subversive
activities.

The stories never really told us who these presumed honeytraps were meant for
and, most importantly, from where and how the reporter or in certain cases the
news desk, got their information. I do recall asking a reporter once if I
could get lucky with the next batch of honeytraps sent in by R&amp;amp;AW. Since
he had filed one such story, my impression from many years ago is that he
wasn‚Äôt amused.

I was reminded of that a couple of days ago when someone Whatsapped me a gem
by Narendra Modi. Apparently, while campaigning for the Gujarat elections,
Modi said that Pakistan was interfering in the polls on the side of the
Congress. Given today‚Äôs alt-facts world, I have trained myself to begin with
scepticism about anything I receive on social media platforms so I decided to
check mainstream Indian media to see what was going on. And voila! There it
was. Modi, speaking at an election rally, had indeed spoken about Pakistan‚Äôs
‚Äúinterference‚Äù and said that some retired Pakistan Army officers were involved
in a plot to ensure that Ahmed Patel ‚Äî I had never heard of him before ‚Äî could
become the next chief minister of Gujarat.

Another report mentioned a name: Sardar Arshad Rafiq. The gentleman, according
to Modi, was a former director-general of the Pakistan Army. Really? What‚Äôs a
DG of Pakistan Army? Sure, there are functional appointments: DG-SPD, DG-I,
DGMO, DGs-Rangers, DG-FWO, DG-W&amp;amp;E; DG-Infantry, DG-ASF, DG-ANF, DG-AC
etcetera. The list is long and while some are three-star, most are two-star
appointments. But what we do not have is a DG-Pakistan Army. The top man is
called COAS and I believe on good authority that that‚Äôs what the Numero Uno in
India is also called.

So, I did the obvious, messaging some former generals to see if they knew
anything about Rafiq, the latest Modi flame or bugbear, depending on how one
looks at it. I came up with nothing.

In the middle of all this Rafiq brouhaha, I also came across another
allegation by Modi. Apparently, the conspiracy went deeper and involved the
Congress directly. Here‚Äôs a direct quote from Modi, as reported in the Indian
press: ‚ÄúThere were media reports yesterday about a meeting at Mani Shankar
Aiyar‚Äôs house. It was attended by Pakistan‚Äôs high commissioner, Pakistan‚Äôs
former foreign minister, India‚Äôs former vice-president and former prime
minister Manmohan Singh. The meeting at Aiyar‚Äôs house carried on for almost
three hours.‚Äù Does one say hallelujah at this point?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. As a Pakistani, I would very much like to have the
capability to drag India around like a head-lugged bear, arrange opposition
rallies, influence elections, choose chief ministers and, yes, prime
ministers, even the weather patterns. And of course, we would want this to
happen without the Indians getting even a whiff of it. You see it‚Äôs important
in a democracy for the voters to act under the illusion that they and their
vote have agency, that while exercising their franchise, they are not being
influenced by any external agent; that, somehow, the value of their choices
inheres in them. Sod those scholars to Hades who write books to tell us that
that is not true. The illusion must remain or the concept of democracy,
sacralised by everyone, will be shattered.

But back to my nefarious Pakistani thoughts. Sadly, we just don‚Äôt have the
capacity to translate our perfidy into real actions. Hell, we can‚Äôt even get
rid of a small band of beards who arrived from Lahore to Islamabad and
conveniently captured the strategic nodal point connecting Islamabad with
Rawalpindi, sat there for over 20 days, cocked a snook at the government and
forced it to sign an instrument of surrender.

It will be one helluva state that genuflects to the miscreants at home but has
the presumed capability to do unto India what Mr Modi thinks it can. But let
it be said in fairness to Modi that he isn‚Äôt the first leader and will
certainly not be the last to invoke a ‚Äúforeign hand‚Äù for reasons of domestic
politicking. Almost every leader in the Subcontinent has done it. The late Mrs
Gandhi, going by reports, was quite adept at it. In Pakistan, we call it
khufia haath (hidden hand). When nothing else works or seems to be working,
use this as a sure clincher.

Meanwhile, The Indian Express did some real reporting work by digging up Rafiq
and speaking to him. He did not serve in the army, or not long enough to
attain any rank, much less holding the fictional appointment of DG-Pakistan
Army. He claims to have done a stint in the Intelligence Bureau, though it
seems unlikely that he is or was from the Police Service of Pakistan. But that
doesn‚Äôt matter. He is famous, not because he can make Ahmed Patel the chief
minister of Gujarat but because Modi thinks he is working towards that end.
For what purpose or to what end is a question that mustn‚Äôt be asked. Invoking
Pakistan is enough reason. Allah be praised!

**INS Kalvari submarine affirms Make in India's giant strides: MDL** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: The commissioning of the first Scorpene-class submarine - 'INS
Kalvari' - into the

Indian Navy

reaffirms the giant strides taken under the 'Make in India' programme, defence
PSU

Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd

(MDL) said today.

The induction of Kalvari into the Indian Navy would be a game-changer in the
field of underwater warfare and its commissioning has added another feather in
MDL's cap, the shipbuilder said after Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

commissioned the submarine at the naval dockyard here today.

""The commissioning of

INS Kalvari

reaffirms the giant strides taken by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd in the
ongoing 'Make In India' programme, which is being actively implemented by the
Department of Defence Production (Ministry of Defence),"" the MDL said in a
statement.

""MDL is constructing six Scorpene-class submarines with technology transfer
from

M/s Naval Group

(formerly known as DCNS) of France,"" it read.

Commodore (retd) Rakesh Anand, the chairman and managing director of MDL, said
the induction of Kalvari into the Indian Navy would be a game-changer in the
field of underwater warfare due to its superiority in all operational aspects.

He also highlighted the aspect pertaining to completion of all weapon firings
prior to commissioning of the submarine which, he said, was indeed a unique
achievement.

The technology used in the submarine has ensured superior stealth features,
such as advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels,
hydro-dynamically optimised shape and the ability to launch a crippling attack
on the enemy using precision guided weapons, the MDL said.

An attack can be launched with both torpedoes and tube- launched anti-ship
missiles, whilst underwater or on surface, it said.

The stealth of this potent platform is enhanced by the special attention given
to various signatures. These stealth features give it invulnerability,
unmatched by most submarines, the statement said.

The Scorpene submarines can undertake multifarious types of missions, such as
anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine
laying and area surveillance, it said.

The submarine is designed to operate in all theatres, with means provided to
ensure interoperability with other components of a Naval task force.

It is a potent platform, marking a generational shift in submarine operations,
it said.

""The building of the Scorpene was indeed a challenge as the complexity of the
simplest of tasks increased exponentially due to all work having to be done in
the most congested of spaces,"" the MDL said.

""This complexity was further aggravated due to the stringent tolerances
required to be achieved. However, these challenges were successfully overcome
by MDL, without any compromise in quality,"" it said.

The second of the Scorpenes under construction at MDL, Khanderi, was launched
in January 2017, and is undergoing rigorous sea trials.

The third Scorpene, Karanj, is being readied for launch shortly.

The remaining three submarines are in various stages of outfitting. The
project is expected to be completed by 2020, the MDL said.

Kalvari is named after the dreaded tiger shark, a deadly deep sea predator of
the Indian Ocean.

As is the tradition, ships and submarines of the Navy, are 're-incarnated'
after decommissioning, the MDL said.

So it is with Kalvari. The first Kalvari, commissioned on December 8 1967, was
also the first submarine of the Indian Navy. It was decommissioned on May 31,
1996 after almost 30 years of yeoman service to the nation.

""The experience and expertise that MDL has gained from the Scorpene project
together with enhanced and upgraded infrastructure has ensured that the
shipyard is fully geared for undertaking construction of the next generation
submarines,"" it said.

311,"July 2008. I was on a cycling expedition, from the southernmost tip of India to its most northern state. Along the way, I took a pit stop at Nagpur, the geographic center of India and the epicenter of Hindu nationalism. There, I saw a building with a bizarre name: ""Hitlers Den"". A pool parlor, its walls were emblazoned with tacky Nazi insignia, and on its shopfront - a swastika on full public display.

The swastika is not an unusual symbol in India. It‚Äôs ubiquitous. Markets, shops, homes, temples, vehicles, notebooks, property documents and even shaved heads are smeared with vermilion or turmeric swastikas, often with the words ‚ÄòShubh Labh‚Äô, meaning ‚Äògood fortune‚Äô. 

But this was most definitely Hitler‚Äôs Nazi swastika - a tilted version of the Hindu swastika on a black background. This blatant display of Nazi symbolism was odd. What was ""Hitler‚Äôs Den"" doing in the middle of Nagpur? I wondered. I brushed it off as stupidity and cycled on.

Ironically, Hitler - the genocidal maniac who murdered more than six million Jews, who propagated a Nazi ideology that promoted hatred, Aryan racial puritanism and white supremacy - continues to find many followers in India, a nation of predominantly brown-skinned people.

Here, Hitler‚Äôs brand of fascism has taken on a distinctly Indian flavour, authenticated with a combination of ethnic hatred and Hindu nationalism, in stark contrast to the principles of ahimsa (non-violence) that accompanied India's freedom struggle.

Recently, browsing through Facebook threw up an eerie shock. ‚ÄòHari Om Heil Hitler‚Äô, said a post next to an image of a young Hitler, followed by a paean to Aryan values. The cover picture read ‚ÄòAum, Hail Aryan, Hail Aryavart‚Äô, meaning 'Hail Aryans, Hail Land of the Aryans.' On display is his German screen name - ‚ÄòKemradschaft Jeet.‚Äô

His feed is full of Nazi insignia with images of Hitler and graphics of Vishnu, a Hindu god known for several reincarnations. ‚ÄòAdolf Hitler, the ultimate avatar,‚Äô said one image. ‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs Swastika God‚Äô, said another. Their posts reflect an oft-repeated theory in neo-Nazi web forums, that Hitler was a reincarnation of Vishnu.

Vile anti-Semitic obloquy accompanied it: ""Germany is now a Rabbit under the shelter of Jewish Finance,"", ""With the Hollywood movie industry and the majority of U.S. television networks, newspapers and publishing houses Jewish-owned, for nearly 70 years, the demonization of Adolf Hitler has been almost relentless."" 

His friends comment in chorus: ""Jai Shree Ram. Heil Hitler"", ('Hail Shree Ram, Heil Hitler'), ""Nazi the great"", ""Hitler was supporter of Indian Nationalist."" Many of them shared a YouTube video with over 100,000 hits, entitled ""Adolf Hitler, The Greatest Story Never Told"", alongside the salutation ""Jai Hind"" (""Victory to India"", an independence-era slogan.)

These posts are a putrid mix of anti-Semitic racism, misogyny and extreme Hindu nationalism. Evoking the widely held myth of Aryan racial superiority (appropriated to refer to 'Aryan' Indians) and the Nazi propaganda of the ""sacralization of terror, embodied in the Kshatriya code and the Bhagavad-Gita"", these posts reflect the belief that Hitler was born to end Kali Yuga, the dark age of Hindu mythology.

As one post reads: ""If we go to North East [of India] we find mixed races of Mongoloids and many more cases where pure Aryan bloodline was lost.""

Digging into social media reveals that there is a large and growing community of Indian Hindu Nazis, who are digitally connected to neo-Nazi counterparts across the world.

Other social media sites and online platforms too had their share of strange, yet fanatical admiration for Hitler, reframed with Hindu nationalism. ""Hitler was great,"" said 'Hindu Hitler' on rediff.com, a popular Indian web portal. ""I too love Hitler and am one of his biggest fans! Hail Hitler!"" said one comment on a YouTube channel run by NewsX, a 24-hour English-language news television channel in India. I also found India-based WhatsApp groups discussing Hitler‚Äôs ""positive contributions."" They portrayed him as Germany‚Äôs great leader, a ""patriotic nationalist,"" who punished the ""traitors.""

This strange adulation for Hitler has already gone beyond social media and entered our educational system. Schools across India have, wittingly or not, propagated Hitler‚Äôs ""achievements"". 

In 2004, when now-Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, school textbooks published by the Gujarat State Board portrayed Hitler as a hero, and glorifyied fascism. The tenth-grade social studies textbook had chapters entitled ""Hitler, the Supremo"", and ""Internal Achievements of Nazism"". The section on the ""Ideology of Nazism"" reads:

""Hitler lent dignity and prestige to the German government. He adopted the policy of opposition towards the Jewish people and advocated the supremacy of the German race.""

The tenth-grade social studies textbook, published by the state of Tamil Nadu in 2011 (with multiple revised editions till 2017) includes chapters glorifying Hitler, praising his ""inspiring leadership"", ""achievements"" and how the Nazis ""glorified the German state"" so, ""to maintain a German race with Nordic elements, [Hitler] ordered the Jews to be persecuted.""

In 2012, when tenth-grade students taking French lessons at a private school in Mumbai were asked to complete a sentence starting with ‚ÄúJ‚Äôadmire‚Äù followed by the name of the historical figure they admired most, nine out of 25 students picked Hitler. Students in the south Indian city of Madurai justified their admiration for Hitler, without even knowing that he was the leader of Germany.

Mein Kampf has also gone mainstream, becoming a 'must-read' management strategy book for India‚Äôs business school students. Professors teaching strategy lecture about how a short, depressed man in prison made a goal of taking over the world and built a strategy to achieve it.

This infamous polemic remains a money-spinner for publishers. English-language editions of Mein Kampf are published by a number of reputable Indian publishing houses, such as Jaico, Printline, Indialog, Maple Press, Mastermind, Prakash, Om Books, Rohan, Adarsh, Ajay, Embassy, Lexicon and Wilco. They fill bookshelves at airports, bookstores and online marketplaces, while cheap pirated versions fill pavement stalls in major cities. Crossword, the Indian book-retailing chain, has sold 25,000 copies in three years. Jaico alone sold 100,000 copies in seven years. It has also been translated into multiple Indian languages ‚Äì Gujarati, Hindi, Malayalam, Bengal and Tamil - and those editions are sold across India.

It is certainly alarming that young people think it‚Äôs ‚Äòcool‚Äô to admire a murderous maniac. Is it the result of the naivety of youth, or of a sustained campaign of political patronage by Hindu nationalists?

In casual conversations, a surprising number of well-read, globe-trotting Indians shared a respectful, almost fanatical, admiration for Hitler. ""This country needs a dictator like Hitler,"" is a common trope I have heard from well-educated Indians with degrees from some of the best universities in the world. A poll conducted by the Times of India in 2002 found that 17 percent favored Adolf Hitler as ""the kind of leader India ought to have."" It is not surprising then, that ice creams, pool parlors, restaurants, clothing stores, home furnishing stores, films and television shows have all chosen to use ""Hitler"" or ""Nazi"" as their brand names.

Several Indian politicians have built formidable careers evoking Hitler‚Äôs ideology and publicly professing their admiration for him. ""It is a Hitler that is needed in India today,"" said Bal Thackeray, the leader of the Hindu extremist outfit Shiv Sena, in 2012.

Known for his exceptional bigotry, xenophobia and hate-mongering, his fascist ideology is eerily similar to, if not an exact replica of, the genocidal Nazi ideology. He has a track record of inciting tensions among Mumbai‚Äôs communities, urging Hindus to form suicide squads to kill Muslims. But he hasn't stopped at 'tactical' acts of violence: he has created a distinct brand of Hindu fascism which explicitly seeks inspiration in Nazi genocide.

""There is nothing wrong"", he said, in a chilling interview in 1993 with Time magazine, ""if Muslims are treated as Jews were in Nazi Germany."" Citing Hitler‚Äôs infamous polemic, he tried to apply fascist ideology in the Indian context. ‚ÄúIf you take Mein Kampf and if you remove the word 'Jew' and put in the word 'Muslim', that is what I believe in,‚Äù he said.

His nephew and political successor, Raj Thackeray, took the baton. Speaking to journalists in 2009, he made this statement: ""When it comes to organizational skills, there are few who can rival Hitler...there are several other things about Hitler, which any leader would envy.""

Nagpur, where I saw ""Hitlers Den,"" the pool parlor, has a unique connection to the Nazi leader. Here, he is a great hero for the leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the right-wing Hindu organization headquartered in the city. It‚Äôs the group from which current Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and also Nathuram Godse, the man who murdered Mahatma Gandhi, emerged.",2017-12-14 17:34:47

**Salutary Benefits From Demonetisation In India: IMF** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi had said last year demonetisation would curb corruption.
(Representational)

**Washington: **

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) sees benefits in the medium-term from
the demonetisation exercise which India carried out about a year ago.

""We see salutary benefits from the demonetisation that took place a year ago.
And there are potential benefits going forward,"" William Murray of the IMF
told reporters at the fortnightly IMF news conference.

Mr Murray said the demonetisation did cause some temporary disruptions in
economic activity, primarily, private consumption and small businesses due to
cash shortages.

""(But) the effects are dissipating,"" he said in response to a question.

""In the medium term, demonetisation could have possible effects, including
through greater formalisation of and the information on economic activities
and a more efficient payment system with a greater use of the banking system
and digital payments,"" Mr Murray said.

The IMF is slated to come out with an update of its projections of India's
growth rate along with the rest of the world in January.

**Yogi govt uses Taj Mahal to lure investors** 

 ______ 
LUCKNOW: The 17th century monument in Agra, the

Taj Mahal

, which was recently in news for being taken off a state government tourism
brochure, has made a quiet entry into Yogi Adityanath government's big
investment plan early next year.

The government, in its brochure prepared for UP Investors' Summit 2018, has
shown the Taj Mahal ‚Äî and its connectivity to the rest of the state through
expressways ‚Äî as one of the key reasons to invest here.

""Best Cultural Destination in India Award for the year 2016-17 by

Lonely Planet

magazine,"" reads a part of the brochure titled 'State of Investment' that has
a huge photograph of the Taj Mahal. The Taj is mentioned at least four times
in the 22-page brochure.

The first page dedicated to infrastructure availability in UP includes a
detailed graphic on the six famous expressways. Here is how two are described
‚Äî ""Agra to Lucknow Expressway: 302 km connecting the state capital to most
popular tourist destination of UP,"" Then, ""Yamuna Expressway: 165 km national
capital to most popular tourist destination of UP"".

The brochure adds, ""Three integrated manufacturing clusters of about 2,500
acres each are proposed at Aligarh-Agra, Kanpur and Allahabad."" The government
has dedicated two pages to dairy industry, saying UP is the ""largest milk
producing state in India"" and that there are investment opportunities for
dairy processing and dairy farming through ""high-valued milk products, cold
chain logistics and storage equipment, fodder production farms, artificial
insemination and animal feed."" It makes a specific mention of highest number
of adult bovine population among all Indian states.

""Over 24.5 million adult female cows and buffaloes, the state is producing 3.5
lakh kg of milk production every year,"" it says. Besides the Taj Mahal and
dairy industry, the government has included focus on Varanasi, saying the
district has key handloom and textile clusters. The state government wants
apparel, retail brands and e-commerce outlets to tap Mirzapur-Bhadohi's carpet
cluster and silk cluster in Varanasi from

Modi

's seat.

For this, government has decided to a hire public relations firm, with a
turnover of Rs 200 crore, to look after the summit. The summit will take place
on February 21-22.

**Arun Jaitley flags infrastructure, bank clean-up as priorities for govt** 

 ______ 
Finance minister Arun Jaitley at the annual meeting of Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Photo: PTI

The government will boost spending on building infrastructure next year even
as it continues to strengthen state-run banks, widen the tax base and
rationalize taxes, said finance minister Arun Jaitley.

It will also continue to push through structural reforms, Jaitley said on
Thursday at the annual meeting of lobby group Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry.

The finance minister‚Äôs comments come weeks before the Union budget will be
presented on 1 February, the last full budget by the National Democratic
Alliance government before general elections in 2019. On Wednesday, Prime
Minister Narendra Modi also reiterated the government‚Äôs commitment to pushing
through more reforms.

‚ÄúIn 2017, India has seen more structural changes taking place than any time in
the recent past. The changes in 1991 were more out of compulsion while the
changes in 2017 more out of conviction,‚Äù Jaitley said, adding that there may
be some short-term adverse consequences of the structural reforms undertaken
by the government.

India rolled out the goods and services tax (GST), brought in changes to the
insolvency and bankruptcy code to make it more effective and initiated the
process of capitalizing state-run banks over the past few months.

Highlighting the steps taken to resolve the issues in the banking sector,
including the Rs2.11 trillion capitalization plan for state-run banks, Jaitley
said it remains an important unfinished item on the government‚Äôs agenda.

‚ÄúCompleting the unfinished task of strengthening state-run banks and resolving
the bad debt problem is unquestionably one of the most important agendas on
the table today. Lending capacity of banks is depleted because of NPAs (non-
performing assets). Banks have a lot of liquidity on account of low-cost
deposits but they are not able to lend because of capital adequacy issues,‚Äù
said Jaitley. Bad loans of state-run banks were more than Rs7 trillion at the
end of the September quarter, as per government estimates.

Jaitley also hinted that the upcoming budget could see the government increase
spending on infrastructure.

‚ÄúWe have to keep the momentum going on infrastructure creation, including
rural infrastructure. Therein lies the core of India‚Äôs future growth story,‚Äù
he said, flagging areas such as railways infrastructure including trains and
stations, urban infrastructure, water, housing and sanitation.

Jaitley added that the government will strive for greater formalization of the
economy, further rationalization of GST and expansion of the tax base to
enable reduction in both direct and indirect tax rates.

I never understood why couldn't she hide her emotions like most other people do, if she can't be a nice person who enjoys others' happiness. But over the year I understood that it's what she is, she can't help it. She's so miserable that she doesn't have control over her expression too.

Now, you'd be thinking why the fuck I am bringing my fucking aunt in here in this political thread.

Well, Modisir just reminded me that. This fucker stalled the parliament session till Gujarat election. Now, any other party would be conscious or shameful enough to let it be for a while so the people don't directly see it in their face. Where as this fucker couldn't wait 24 hours after election.

Same happened for declaring the election date in Gujarat. As soon as his grand rallies were done which give away freebies, election dates were announced.

What's the similarities in both? Both of them are constrained by their nature and both of them think we're fucking retarded that can't see through them.

**In Last 5 Months, BJP Coffers Received Rs 80,000 Crore, Claims Anna Hazare** 

 ______ 
Anna Hazare has sought people's support for Jan Lokpal movement to be launched
next year. (File)

**Guwahati: **

Attacking the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, prominent social
activist Anna Hazare on Friday said the country has topped the list of corrupt
countries in Asia in the last three years of the NDA rule and claimed that Rs
80,000 crore has come to the coffers of the BJP in the last five months as
donation.

Mr Hazare, citing a Forbes Magazine article that quoted a Transparency
International survey, said India tops the list of corrupt countries in Asia.
""I am not claiming this but it being reported by Forbes Magazine after
conducting a survey among the Asian countries,"" he said.

""I have been silent for the last three years. When a new government comes we
must give them some time. So I remained silent, but now the time has come to
speak against them. I am going to start another movement for a strong Jan
Lokpal as well as for the farmers of the country from March 23 next year,""
said Mr Hazare.

Slamming the Centre, he said that Rs 80,000 crore had come to the coffers of
the ruling party in the last five months as donation.

""The common people are still reeling under problems. The farmers of the
country are suffering. Banks give loans to the farmers but slap interest as
per their whims and fancies. The Reserve Bank of India must fix a rate of
interest for all the farmers and banks should not be allowed to fix the
interest for the benefit of the farmers.""

""The farmers commit suicide as they fail to get good price for their crops to
repay the loan. There is no MSP for their paddy,"" he said while expressing his
concerns.

He said he had written 32 letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the past
three years but received no response to any of them from the PMO.

""I am going to involve everyone in the movement for a strong Jan Lokpal and
farmers' issues. I am going everywhere to speak to the people. We are ready to
go to jail. But if they put us in jails we must ensure that every jail in the
country should be filled by people,"" said Mr Hazare.

The veteran leader said while the then UPA government under the leadership of
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a weak Jan Lokpal, the present BJP-led NDA
government has further weakened the Jan Lokpal.

""Earlier there was a provision which made it mandatory for the officers to
declare their assets but the present government abolished it. While the
companies were allowed to donate 7.5 per cent of their profit to political
parties, now any amount can be donated to the political parties,"" said Mr
Hazare, while appealing to people to support the movement to be started from
March 23.

You can wrap your head around the fact is why Indian voter are getting smart and voting as individuals instead of by Caste, Religion, etc.

&gt; BJP is against Triple Talaq only because it ""hurts"" the Muslims. 

What????  Triple Talaq ""hurts"" Muslims.  How??? because it leads to less destitute women, less abondend children, a greater safety net for muslim women and stronger muslim families.  All these things definately ""hurt"" muslims


 Triple Talaq doesn't only hurt Muslims, it hurts the society as a whole. 

&gt; They are NOT reformers but rabid Muslim haters. It's just a happy accident their hate is resulting in something good.

They hate muslims so much that Muslim women voted them in power in UP and broke up muslim vote bank.

Sati has been abolished since 1800 in case you were not paying attention

If it was up to me, I would hang every idiot who even looks at a minor in the wrong way but ground reality is that even Muslim women don't oppose it.   You may claim otherwise but India is not a dictatorship and BJP can be voted out of power.

The change in society comes from within.  Unless a large portion of society wants change,  a democratically elected govt can't do much.

By your stupid logic, Bangladesh must be very progressive since they have a women in the top office. Modi appointing his chamchas as ministers is not a sign of women empowerment, but usual politics. Stop treating exceptions as rules. The comments of BJP/RSS leaders about how women should be restricted to being housewives is recorded multiple times on camera. So, please spare me the PR about Modi/BJP being a champion of women's rights.

&gt;You can wrap your head around the fact is why Indian voter are getting smart and voting as individuals instead of by Caste, Religion, etc.

Indian voter is not getting smarter but more bigoted. Voting for saffron mass murderers is not being smart but being communal. 

&gt;What???? Triple Talaq ""hurts"" Muslims. How??

Ask that question to the illiterate morons of RSS who keeps saying Muslim Personal Laws are anti-Hindu. Saffron morons keep arguing that not allowing them to follow primitive religious practices like Muslims are allowed to is a sign of discrimination. That's their idea of ""Discrimination""

From your comment, it's clear you lack comprehension skills. It's not me who is saying banning Triple Talaq ""hurts"" Muslims, but it is RSS chutiyas who thinks of it as a ""revenge"" against Muslims.

&gt;They hate muslims so much that Muslim women voted them in power in UP and broke up muslim vote bank.

Which cow-urine drinking moron from RSS/BJP has told you this? That PR claim has been debunked already with voting data. But if you spend most of your time on Postcard News and ShankNaad websites, it is possible you might have missed it.

Dr. Low IQ, please read when the law was passed and who all opposed it. Don't parade your ignorance with confidence. Cases of Sati kept popping up even after independence. Go and read who defended Sati then.

**Congress ran out of ideas once PM Modi got into the act late November** 

 ______ 
Barring an outlier's prediction and another who strayed upward from the
'zone', all exit polls forecast a comfortable majority for the

BJP

but short of a two-third majority.

Likewise, with the exception of the two agencies which predicted a runaway
victory for the BJP, others forecast moderate gains to the

Congress

with it gaining seats in the range of 5 to almost 20 percentage points.

But given the high decibel campaign, especially towards the end and reversal
of the popular impression that the BJP would at best somehow squeak through,
it appears that out of the tactics the two parties deployed, the BJP was more
successful in converging these towards in the endgame stage compared to the
Congress.

Undoubtedly, BJP once again proved itself to be more adept at 'closing' a
campaign while the Congress will probably live with the tag of 'chokers' who
ran out of new ideas once PM

Narendra Modi

got into the act from November 27.

Only the most virulent Modi critic will deny his role in the projected BJP
victory. Without a doubt, Modi remains

Gujarat

's leader number one by a huge distance and his personalised canvassing
resonated greatly with people.

Moreover, emergence of

Rahul Gandhi

as a credible national challenger possibly solidified Modi's position in the
state. Make no mistake, in this election, the issue of Gujarati asmita or
pride would have played as big a role as in state polls since 2002 since when
the notion that the BJP represents aspirations of Gujaratis and that others
were opposed to the state's progress, gained ground. With Gandhi taking charge
of the Congress in the middle of the polls, a vote for the Congress may have
been considered having the potential to weaken the most popular Gujarati and
may have made people reconsider their earlier decision of jettisoning BJP.

Once considered a pocket-borough of BJP, the party began worrying from mid-
September owing to emergence of anti-incumbency sentiment triggered by an
assortment of factors ranging from social unrest to post GST rollout.

At that stage, without getting into a contest with people over public
perception of 'misses' in the three years plus period since Modi moved away
from the state to become prime minister, the BJP purposefully emphasised gains
and progress made during the 13 years of Modi as chief minister. The party
worked overtime to play up the memory of achievements of 'Modi the CM' versus
the assessment of 'shortcomings' of Modi the PM. Exit polls suggest this
worked to BJP's advantage as the trust factor towards Modi, especially in his
avatar as CM, remains as high as ever.

Unlike voters in other parts of the country who may have to be promised of
Achhe Din while seeking a vote, Gujaratis possibly need just a nudge to be
reminded of 'good times'. Moreover, the party's social media campaign that
Modi was ""renovating the nation"" by bold reforms like demonetisation and GST
and that this was causing temporary hardships, would have resounded with
people. Like last year when people backed demonetisation, the idea still
remains a morally-correct notion and no one publicly contests it for fear of
being seen as being in league with black-marketeers.

Over the part two and half years there has been much talk about Patidars
turning against BJP. Despite such perception and visible anger of the
community, the BJP did not stop engaging with the community. This was evident
when the party nominated more Patidar candidates than the Congress. Exit polls
suggest that while Hardik Patel may have been a great draw in public rallies
and on the social media, this backing did not possibly convert into votes for
the Congress and instead were either not cast - as the lower turnout suggests
- or eventually a significant number of Patels remains BJP loyalists.

Visible anger against the BJP in rural areas has been one of the major talking
points and this writer can vouchsafe for its presence in complete contrast to
past.

Yet, as exit poll data suggests, this anger has firstly, been confined mainly
to rural pockets of north Gujarat and Saurashtra. Secondly, its intensity
possibly waned when it mattered most. In hindsight, if actual results follows
the pattern of exit polls, it would appear that this 'visible anger' was
mainly articulated by Congress voters in previous elections.

Their voice echoed loudly because unlike in the past when people chose to
remain silent, this time they decided to articulate views because successive
social agitations provided courage to people to publicly adopt anti-BJP
postures.

Exit poll data shows that this change is possibly reflected in a rise of 1-2
percentage points in the vote share of Congress. But BJP has been able to
retain its vote share because increased bipolarity possibly reduced votes of
other parties and independent candidates who notched upward of 11% votes in
2012.

Exit polls also depict the BJP firmly holding on to its bastions in South
Gujarat and recovering the terrain in central Gujarat. If this eventually
turns out to be true, it would indicate expansion of BJP support in tribal
areas, one section of which had remained loyal to the Congress in 2007 and
2012.

They argued that a woman burning herself along with husband‚Äôs body is a ‚Äònatural act‚Äô of devotion

The act was passed because BJP leaders glorified sati.

During Rajeev's time, Congress had grown so much in strength - it was beyond imagination.

It was in the 1980s that INC really got such a strong grip over India - that it has taken at least 3 decades to weaken that grip. 

Rajeev was way bigger than just a crown prince. He was considered as the messiah by the 1950s generation who were born after Independence and looked at him to lead him into the new India, with their growing aspirations. 

And to give him credit, apart from his foreign policy goof-ups, he did quite OK. Or to put it the other way, he did not do as major goof-ups as a crown prince could have. He was smart enough to have the right people by his side, and he let PVNR and indirectly MMS grow, who did really great during there time as PM and FM respectively. 

For people who find problems with the Nehru/Gandhi Dynasty - nobody really has a big beef with Nehru or Rajeev - It is Indira and Sanjay who really screwed up. 

Indira messed up so much that it changed the entire political landscape.

**MCI era is over: New regulator for medical education, exit tests for MBBS** 

 ______ 
Written by

Abantika Ghosh

| New Delhi |

Updated: December 16, 2017 7:51 am

Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Parliament, Friday. (Source: Express photo by
Renuka Puri)

The Union Cabinet Friday cleared the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill,
ending the era of Medical Council of India (MCI) as the apex medical education
regulator conducting annual inspections, and paving the way for an exit exam
for medical graduates.

According to the Bill, a 25-member commission selected by a search committee
headed by the Union Cabinet Secretary will replace the elected MCI.

The move is based on recommendations of the Ranjit Roychowdhury Committee and
a Parliamentary standing committee ‚Äî both concluded that a regulator elected
by the fraternity it would monitor cannot be effective.

The Bill also provides for the introduction of a licentiate (exit) examination
within three years of its passage by Parliament. Such a move would make the
medical sector the first in the country‚Äôs higher education system to have a
common entrance test (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test), counselling and
exit examination.

On the ground, the Bill represents a radical shift from the present system in
which medical colleges are subject to annual inspections on physical,
infrastructural and bed-patient norms.

Under the NMC, which includes a Medical Advisory Council where states will be
represented, colleges need permission only once for establishment and
recognition. Apart from removing the need for annual renewal of recognition,
colleges can, on their own, increase the number of seats subject to the
present cap of 250, and start PG courses. The Medical Assessment and Rating
Board constituted by the central government can, however, conduct inspections.

Under the NMC Bill, if a college is found to be in violation of norms, such as
those governing teachers, laboratories, patients, etc., it can be fined sums
ranging from half of the cumulative fees it charges from students to 10 times
that amount.

Over the years, there have been numerous allegations about the functioning of
MCI, with its system of annual inspections being accused of being ‚Äúrandom‚Äù and
susceptible to corruption.

In 2010, the MCI‚Äôs then chairman Dr Ketan Desai was arrested and the council
superceded by a Board of Governors. But that stop-gap arrangement did not last
long.

Last year, in a chapter on ‚Äúcorruption in MCI‚Äù in its 92nd report, the
Parliamentary standing committee for Health and Family Welfare said that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the
President, MCI during evidence before the Committee admitted that corruption
was there when there was sanctioning of medical colleges, or increasing or
decreasing seats‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Committee has also been informed that the private medical colleges
arrange ghost faculty and patients during inspections by MCI and no action is
taken for the irregularity. The Committee has also been given to understand
that MCI is proactive in taking action on flimsy grounds against Government
Medical Colleges which are 100% better,‚Äù the report said.

For years, private medical colleges have challenged MCI decisions in court and
matters have reached such a state that even the role of judges is under the
scanner. A few years ago, a former vigilance officer of the council quit,
alleging harassment and non-cooperation.

‚ÄúWith technology, it is now easier to keep a check. Almost all colleges have
biometric attendance and whether teachers are present or not can be checked in
Delhi. But what we are aiming at really is not so much focus on the brick-and-
mortar functioning of the college but on the quality of students it produces.
Once the licentiate examination starts, performance of students would be an
automatic system for rating colleges,‚Äù said sources.

A similar system is currently in place for foreign medical graduates. They
have to appear for an examination to be able to practice in India, and their
performance is a ready reckoner on the quality of foreign medical
institutions.

**""PM Taking Us Back To Medieval Times,"" Says Congress' New Chief Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
Rahul Gandhi greets mother Sonia Gandhi after taking over as new Congress
president

**New Delhi: **

Rahul Gandhi became Congress president today, replacing his mother Sonia
Gandhi and taking charge of India's oldest party after what many describe as
the longest-ever political apprenticeship. At a ceremony held on the lawns of
the party's 24 Akbar Road headquarters in Delhi, the 47-year-old

accepted a certificate for his promotion

, watched by Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the
stage and younger sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the audience.

Rahul Gandhi is the fifth member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to lead the
Congress; no one challenged his elevation in the organizational election that
critics called a sham. Images of Mahatma Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan
Singh beamed on a banner behind him as he took charge after the traditional
""Vande Mataram"".

""Congress took India to 21st century, but the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi)
is taking us backwards, to medieval times, where people are being butchered
because of who they are, beaten for what they believe and killed for what they
eat,"" Rahul Gandhi said, attacking PM Modi and the government in his first
speech as Congress boss.

""Foreign policy is in tatters, everything is subservient to one leader, his
personal image...they can only defeat us if we back down, we have to stand up
to them, the Congress won't back down.""

Congress central election authority chairman Mullappally Ramachandran gives
Rahul Gandhi the certificate of his elevation to as Congress president (PTI)

Switching between English and Hindi, text and extempore, he said: """"The BJP is
spreading hatred and communalism. They break, while we unite. They ignite the
fire, we put it out. They divide, we unite.""

Sonia Gandhi, who led the party for 19 years, said in an emotional farewell:
""I was terrified when I took over the Congress 20 years ago, my hands were
shaking. I didn't know how I would manage, I had no political experience.""

But Rahul, she said, was stronger. ""Rahul is my son, and it would not be right
of me to praise him. But I can say this, that in these testing times, he has
stood up to dangerous men in power. He has suffered due to violence in his
life, it made him stronger and unafraid."" Looking moved, Rahul Gandhi kissed
his mother after her speech.

Rahul Gandhi is widely expected to begin his presidency with two new defeats
for the Congress; exit polls say the party won't win Gujarat, where the BJP
has ruled for 22 years, and will cede Himachal Pradesh.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and her husband Robert Vadra attend the ceremony where
Rahul Gandhi was officially made Congress president (PTI)

In Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi led the Congress campaign from the front for the
first time, going all-in as the BJP sent all its prominent faces to PM Modi's
home state. Congress leaders say Rahul Gandhi has proved his chops with a
spirited campaign, a newfound ease in political-speak and willingness to take
on even PM Modi on his home turf.

Since Rahul Gandhi became the party's vice president in 2013 and the official
number 2, the Congress has lost nine states and won three including Bihar,
where the party was left without power this year after Nitish Kumar swapped
partners and reembraced old ally BJP.

The Congress is now in power in only five states, compared to the BJP's 14.
The new Congress boss has his task cut out, with polls due in 16 states before
the national election in 2019.

India would have become a Hindu Pakistan by 1960 if Nehru hadn't applied his principles to the then government.

Back when the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha was actively sucking British cock, Nehru, under the tutelage of Gandhi guided India into the secular republic it is today. 

So, fuck you and your bigoted ideology.

I never ever get political, but your hatred against one of the greatest men who've ever led India enrages me.

**PM Modi approves two new schemes for North East** 

 ______ 
GUWAHATI: Prime minister,

Narendra Modi

on Saturday said Centre has approved a new

Central Sector Scheme

, North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme which will fill the
gaps in creation of infrastructure in two sectors.

Modi who was in Mizoram said, ""One sector is physical infrastructure relating
to water supply, power, connectivity and especially projects promoting
tourism. The other is social sector projects of education and health. The new
scheme has been designed after due consultations with State
Governments.However, to ensure continuity, all ongoing projects under NLCPR
(Non Lapsable Central Pool of Resources) will be provided funds for completion
by March 2022.

The prime minister added that the new Scheme will be 100 percent centrally
funded as against the NLCPR, where 10 percent contribution had to come from
the State Governments. The Central Government will be providing Rs 5300 crore
to North Eastern States under the Scheme over the next three years.

""As a result of the efforts of the Union Government, schemes for the benefit
of the North-Eastern region have been gained momentum. Projects stuck for
years, are now progressing. I am told, the Ministry for Development of the
North-East Region is also supporting the activities of the North Eastern
Handicrafts and Handloom Development Corporation; and the North Eastern
Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation."" Modi added.

Modi dedicated of the 60 Mega-Watt Tuirial Hydro-power Project to the nation.
This comes 13 years after the last major central sector hydro-power project in
the North-Eastern Region--the Kopili Stage-II.

Tuirial Hydro-power project is the first major Central Sector Project to be
successfully commissioned in Mizoram. It is the first large hydro-power
project in the State. It will produce 251 Million Units of electrical energy
every year, and boost the socio-economic development of the State.

With the commissioning of this project, Mizoram becomes the third power-
surplus State in the North-East, after Sikkim and Tripura. The project was
first declared and cleared by the Union Government of Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee, way back in 1998, but got delayed.

Modi said, ""The completion of this project is a reflection of our commitment
to complete on-going projects and usher in a new era of development in the
North Eastern region. I see no reason why Mizoram cannot become a net-power
exporter. Our aim is not just to make the North Eastern States power surplus.
We also aim to develop a state-of-art transmission system which ensures that
surplus power is transferred to other power deficient parts of the country. ""

Modi said, ""My Government is investing close to Rupees10,000 crores for a
comprehensive improvement in the power transmission system in the North
Eastern States. We are betting on the skills and strengths of India's youth.
We believe in 'empower through enterprise' - which is creating the right eco-
system for innovation and enterprise to flourish so that our land is home to
the next big ideas that can transform humanity.

He further said, ""My Government believes in competitive and cooperative
federalism, where there is healthy competition between States. I am convinced
that States are the main drivers of change. We have taken a number of
initiatives to infuse healthy competition among States. A Committee of Chief
Ministers made recommendations to rationalize Centrally Sponsored Schemes. We
duly accepted the recommendations.

He detailed despite fiscal constraints, the sharing pattern of core centrally
sponsored schemes for North Eastern States has been continued at 90-10. For
other schemes, it stands at 80-20. The Union Government has plans to focus on
around 115 districts which are relatively backward when evaluated on various
social indicators. This will also benefit the backward districts of North
Eastern States including Mizoram.

The prime minister said lack of connectivity is one of the biggest hurdles in
the path of development of the North Eastern Region. ""We aim for a
Transformation by Transportation through investment in infrastructure in the
region. The Union Government has sanctioned over 3800 kilometers of National
Highway with an investment of Rupees 32000 crore during last three years, out
of which nearly 1200 kilometers of road has already been constructed. ""

Modi said that the Union Government will be investing another Rupees 60,000
crore under Special Accelerated Road Development Programme in the North-East
and Rs. 30,000 crore under Bharatmala in the next two to three years to build
a network of high-ways and roads in the North East Region. We are committed to
bring all the State Capitals of North East Region on the Rail map.

The Prime minister informed that the Government of India is executing 15 New
Rail Line projects of 1385 kilometers length, at a cost of over Rs.47,000
crore. The railways reached Mizoram last year, with the inauguration of the
rail line connecting Bhairabi in Mizoram with Silchar in Assam. ""I had laid
the foundation for a new line to take rail connectivity to Aizawl in 2014.With
the support of the State Government, we shall connect the State Capital Aizawl
with broad gauge rail line.""

He added that the Union Government has been proactively following the 'Act
East Policy'. As a gate-way to South East Asia, Mizoram stands to gain
immensely from this. It can emerge as a key transit point for trade with
Myanmar and Bangladesh. Various bilateral projects are at various stages of
completion. Some of the major initiatives include the

Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project

,

the Rih-Tedim Road Project

and Border Haats.

Modi expressed hope that all these will increase the scope for economic
linkages, and contribute to the overall economic growth and development of the
North-Eastern Region. The high literacy rate, scenic beauty and availability
of large English speaking population in Mizoram make for a perfect blend to
develop the State as a model tourist destination.

""The State offers significant scope for adventure tourism, cultural tourism,
eco-tourism, wild-life tourism, and community-based rural tourism. If
developed well, tourism can emerge as the biggest employer in the state.The
Union Government has sanctioned two tourism projects worth 194 crore rupees
for Mizoram in the last 2 years, to promote eco-tourism and adventure
tourism.The Central Government has already released 115 crore rupees for
implementation of these projects,: Modi added.

Modi said that Bamboo which is a source of livelihood for lakhs of people of
North East, has been under a very restrictive regulatory regime. ""You could
not transport or sell the Bamboo produced in your own field without a permit.
Our Government with an aim to reduce this pain, has changed the regulatory
regime. Now there will be no requirement of any permit or permission for
producing, transporting and selling Bamboo and its products produced by
farmers in their own fields. This will benefit lakhs of farmers and will add
to the efforts to double farmers' income by 2022.""

Modi pinned hope that soft power of football can become Mizoram's global
identity. There are many other prominent sports persons from Mizoram who have
brought glory to the State and the country. These include the Olympian Archer
C. Lalremsanga , boxer Jenny Lalremliani, weight lifter Lalchhahimi, and
hockey player Lalruatfeli.

ok, in your rant, this is the one part that got me giggling, you really think that he became CM on the tea-samosa network of friends and neighbors?

he became CM by pitting RSS against Advani and the old guard. After he did that, he befriended industrialists, by befriended i mean gave them direct access to state coffers. I don't think any Gujarati would appreciate the fact, that tax collected from their business, went to a big hole in Adani's pocket simply because Modi was friends with him. 

The only reason a lot of anger from business men did not show on the streets is probably because BJP clandestinely helped them deposit money in banks *before* demonetization(for a fat payback). So, while business men and shop owners of rest of country stood in long queues, there weren't any reports from Surat of traders being unable to conduct business.  If they think this is good for their future, good for them.

Second, Rahul Gandhi clearly mentions what he means when implies that Modi is taking India towards a regressive path -

The Congress has never been shy to state publicly - in the past or even now - that they do not pander to western capitalism or capitalists. Their ideology, and better still, all their actions based on it clearly prove this. They have always believed in an inclusive model of growth and that is why the Congress is equally at ease with industrialists discussing capitalism with them or the workers uninion disucssing communism with them or with the farmers or the poor or the middle class discussing socialism with them. They genuinely care to take everyone along with them as India grows.

Actually, such pandering to the sentiments of some Hindu sects have been existing from the time of Nehru. But you could still eat beef and not be killed then. Even during Vajpayees time, I don't think anyone has been killed for what you choose to eat.

Yeah, that would be more belivable if your 56-inch fool of a leader actually prosecutes somebody from the Congress instead of just claiming that he has ""proof"" of their corruption.

Probably Italy to visit his ailing grandmother but with his own money. He used to work in a private firm and also gets a salary as an MP. Unlike Modi *kaka* whose trips are financed by his rich buddies or worse our public money.

And Advani is still trying to prove his innoncence in court ... The Congress just doesn't talk but acts too - that's why people trust them. And yet, you blindly choose to trust Modi's *jumlas* without even thinking whether he acts on them!

&gt; This is about Congress and Pappu, not your obsession with Modi Kaka.

In your fantasies, yes. You deliberately want to ignore that today under Modi and his *Sanghi goondas*, people are being killed and intimidated just for having differing opinions or beliefs or even for worshipping different Gods.

**A battle of consequence: Anti-Modism is not an alternative to Hindutva** 

 ______ 
The pseudo-secular forces spread across the country saw the 2017 Gujarat
assembly election as a laboratory for building a social coalition of anti-
Hindutva forces, which could become a mirror for national politics. The
election campaign and the political discourse revealed their unwillingness to
reconcile with the emergence of Hindutva as an influential ideology and
Narendra Modi as a national leader. They harbour hopes of a BJP defeat and a
sense of euphoria about its implications for national politics. They applied
immense psychological pressure on the voters of Gujarat and offered the
delusion that they could be the inspiration for a formidable transformation of
the polity.

The justification for their spirited efforts to create an anti-BJP climate in
Gujarat is simple: It is the home state of both Modi and BJP president Amit
Shah. The intensive campaign by the prime minister himself was held up to
argue how important the state was for him. This is only partially true.

In the last UP assembly election, the same people said Modi had a lot riding
on the election results since Varanasi was the prime minister‚Äôs constituency
and that he and Shah did intensive campaigning. The fact is during elections,
Modi and Shah work hard for the party as party workers without being uppity
about the positions they hold.

Though the anti-Hindutva and anti-Modi forces have remained more or less the
same for the past one-and-a-half decade, their posturing has changed. In the
quest for an opportunity to delegitimise Modi, they treat every election as a
referendum on both Modi and Hindutva.

It gives the pseudo-secularists an exaggerated notion of their own importance
in national politics and makes them presume that the BJP will be defeated in
Gujarat. Though they have no stake in Gujarat, they have been busy generating
narratives on issues ranging from the economy to social philosophy.

**Read | A battle of consequence: A campaign of interesting OTMs (other than Modi)**

The reasons are more than obvious. They hope an anti-BJP outcome in Gujarat
would be a golden opportunity to reignite the anti-Modi sentiment. Their
collusion with forces outside India who are opposed to any nationalist
consolidation in the country is not unknown. The Western media, including The
New York Times, The Washington Post and Guardian share the counter-narrative
of the Indian pseudo-secularists that the 2014 mandate inaugurated religious
majoritarianism in New Delhi. Pseudo-secular intellectuals spontaneously
become natural allies of a leader or party that poses a challenge to Hindutva
and Modi. Hence, their sympathy for the Congress and the glorification of
Hardik Patel, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor. That the pseudo-seculars could
endorse the politics of a reactionary patchwork of castes reveal the toxicity
of their anti-Modi sentiment.

The Congress and the pseudo-seculars have willfully worked on their doctrine
of a balkanised Hindu community and monolithic minorities to establish a
counter-hegemony. The BJP has exposed their unethical design. It is a truism
that in the age of global consciousness no election can be absolutely
localised. Voters go beyond local aspirations and immediate reasons while
deciding their choices. Factors and forces outside their territory impact
people in varying proportions. This happened in Gujarat too. They intuitively
understood the hidden agenda of the pseudo-seculars who rebelled against the
Modi government by re-electing it.

Modi and Hindutva have been blamed for all small and big isolated incidents.
This had attracted international attention as well as criticism of the
government. Gujarati voters rightly apprehend that the pseudo-seculars want to
use an anti-BJP mandate to destabilise the Modi government and attack Hindutva
as a discredited ideology of majoritarianism.

Another folly of the pseudo-seculars is their obsession of judging voters and
predicting outcomes through conventional tools and wisdom. Voters have
changed. Their voting pattern is not guided by a single factor and nationalist
aspirations outweigh narrow considerations. The anger visible in the
mobilisations of the three caste leaders was neither a sign of rejection of
the BJP nor disillusionment with Modi. It was a message for the ruling party
to cure its ills, which are side-effects of being in power for more than two
decades. Modi and his team neutralised the restive sections with their
humility and silent regret.

The impact of the Gujarat election on the Congress reveals a shift in the
ideological fulcrum of Indian politics: The old model of secularism, which was
based on minority worship has shifted to the Hindu tradition of secularism
that abhors the categories of minority and majority. The pseudo-secularist
discourse in Gujarat did not mention the Sachar Committee report and Rahul
Gandhi presented himself as a devout Hindu. This is partly due to the success
of the RSS in consolidating Hindus and changing the ideological contours of
Indian politics. Time alone can tell if Rahul‚Äôs temple visits and the mention
of his sacred thread is just electoral Hindutva or a genuine shift in Congress
thinking in the post-Sonia era.

While the BJP-RSS is consistent in its definition of secularism, the Congress
has been playing with multiple ideas of secularism. Exit polls show the voters
of Gujarat have opted for a stable polity. However, there also seems to be a
message for the BJP that economic development needs to be egalitarian and
benefit rural areas, farmers and marginalised people. The message for pseudo-
seculars is that anti-Modism can‚Äôt be a substitute for an alternative vision.

## Highlights

Modi, addressing a rally in Meghalaya, announced Rs 90,000 crore for improving
roads in the northeast.

  * _2_

Act East Policy would soon make Mizoram the gateway to South East Asian
countries: Modi.

  * _3_

Both Mizoram and Meghalaya are set to witness Assembly elections early next
year.

In a major boost to road connectivity in the northeast, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi today announced Rs 90,000 crore for improving roads and national
highways in the next two to three years.

""Over the next 2-3 years, an investment of about Rs 60,000 crore is proposed
under the Special Accelerated Road Development Project (SARDP) in the
Northeast and an investment of Rs 30,000 crore under Bharatmala is proposed
for development of national highways in northeastern states,"" Modi said while
addressing a BJP rally in Meghalaya.

Modi is on a day-long visit to the northeast where he dedicated to the nation
a 271-km two-lane national highway connecting Tura in western Meghalaya and
Shillong.

Before heading to Meghalaya, PM Modi visited Mizoram and said the Act East
Policy of the BJP government would soon make the state the gateway to the
South East Asian countries.

Both Mizoram and Meghalaya are set to witness Assembly elections early next
year.

Modi, stating that poor connectivity was one of the biggest hurdles in the
path of development of the north-eastern region, said his government had
sanctioned over 3,800 kms of national highway, with an investment of Rs 32,000
crore, over the last three years.

Nearly 1,200 kms of roads had already been constructed, he added.

Talking of infrastructure schemes in the region, the prime minister said the
Centre had launched the North East Special Infrastructure Scheme (NESIS) to
fill in the gaps in the basic facilities.

""The new scheme has been designed after due consultations with the state
governments. However, to ensure continuity, all the ongoing projects under the
Non Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR) will be given funds for
completion by March, 2022,"" he said, adding that the Centre would provide Rs
5,300 crore to the north-eastern states under the scheme over the next three
years.

The PM also said the farmers in the northeast could now produce, transport and
sell bamboo without any restrictions as the Centre had relaxed the bamboo
restriction regime.

Modi added that bamboo, which was earlier classified as tree, was now
classified as grass to enable its cultivation for commercial purposes.

Expressing optimism that Mizoram would continue to produce sportspersons who
would excel on the world stage, Modi said, ""The soft power of football can
become Mizoram's global identity.""

**Before Gujarat Results, BJP Lawmaker Predicts A Shocker For The Party** 

 ______ 
The lawmaker cited anti-incumbency against the BJP government for his
prediction (File)

**Pune: **

As most exit poll surveys predicted the Bharatiya Janata Party to win the
Gujarat Assembly polls, its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Kakade has claimed that the
party would not win enough seats to form the next government in the state.

""Forget absolute majority, the party will not even get enough number of seats
to form the government. The Congress on the other hand will reach close to the
majority mark,"" Mr Kakade claimed.

""If at all the party retains power in the state, it will be only and only
because of Narendra Modi,"" he said.

Mr Kakade claimed his team has conducted a survey in Gujarat and his claim was
based on the outcome of that survey.

""I had sent a team of six people to Gujarat. They mostly covered the rural
part of the state where they met farmers, drivers, waiters and labourers.
Based on their survey and my own observation, I feel the BJP will not get
absolute majority in Gujarat,"" he said.

Mr Kakade cited anti-incumbency against the BJP government as a reason for his
prediction.

""The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for 22 years. Since Independence, apart
from the communists in West Bengal, there is not a single party in the country
which has remained in power for 25 years,"" he claimed.

Mr Kakade said the negative feeling against the party may cost BJP in this
election.

He pointed out that BJP leaders did not talk about development in any of the
campaign rallies in the last phase.

""In the last a few rallies, there was no word on development by the party
leaders. There was no mention of employment generation in Gujarat or about any
major decision taken by the party during last three years. The rallies were
aimed at targeting the Opposition and making an emotional appeal to voters,""
he said.

**Times Group's mega online poll: 79% of people say they will vote for Modi in 2019** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

remains India's most popular leader with no competition in sight, according to
a mega online survey by the

Times Group

.

Despite the note ban, GST and a no-holds-barred poll campaign in Gujarat, more
than three quarters of respondents, in the survey conducted in nine languages
across 10 Times Group media properties, said they will vote for him if

Lok Sabha

polls were held today.

** Read: Most voters say no to politics of religion in Times Group's mega online poll **

Similarly, 79% of those surveyed said a Modi-led government is currently the
most likely scenario in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The three-part survey
was conducted online over 72 hours between December 12 and 15 with over half a
million responses.

According to the survey, only 20% said they would vote for

Congress

president-elect

Rahul Gandhi

in a head-to-head contest with Modi today.

However, while a significant 58% of those surveyed remain unimpressed with
him, 34% respondents said the Gandhi scion has been able to establish anew
connect with voters.

** Read: Most Indians believe Modinomics working, finds Times Group's mega online poll **

But what is worrisome for Congress is that as many as 73% of the respondents
said they don't consider the party an alternative even after Rahul's
elevation.

Does that mean if Rahul were out of the picture, Congress will fare somewhat
better? Not really, according to the survey.

While 38% of those polled said they wouldn't vote for Congress if a non-Gandhi
were to be its leader, almost an equal number (37%) said they would vote for
the party if another leader from outside the family were to lead it.

While Rahul may or may not be winning the personality contest, the larger-
than-life figure of Modi appears to be key for those who are in favour of BJP.
Consider this - 31% of those surveyed said they wouldn't vote for

BJP

if he weren't to be its PM candidate. This means that while BJP has retained
its core constituency (48% said they would vote for the party even if he was
not the leader), PM Modi remains its premium brand and adds a sizeable number
to its vote base.

Each response in the survey has been geo-tagged to city and state. The results
were concealed from voters till after voting ended.

**Hafiz Saeed vows to avenge 1971 defeat, will liberate Kashmir from India** 

 ______ 
## Highlights

  * _1_

Hafiz Saeed has warned India.

  * _2_

Saeed has vowed to avenge Pakistan's defeat in the Indo-Pak War of 1971.

  * _3_

Saeed was recently released from house arrest.

Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistan-based terrori st who masterminded the 26/11 Mumbai
attacks, says he wants to free Kashmir to avenge the creation of Bangladesh
after the 1971 India-Pakistan War.

""We will avenge creation of Bangladesh by liberating Kashmir,"" ANI quoted
Hafiz Saeed as saying in Lahore on Vijay Diwas, a day which commemorates what
Bangladesh calls 'Victory Day.'

46 years ago, on December 16, tens of thousands of Pakistanis raised white
flags in surrender the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini - a moment which marked
the end of the Indo-Pak war of 1971.

Yesterday, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the three service chief
paid tribute to the martyrs of the third India-Pakistan War.

Hafiz Saeed leads the Jamaat-ud Daawa, a proscribed organisation and a front
for the Lashkar-e-Taiba. He was recently released from house arrest in
Pakistan's Lahore.

After his release, the US warned Pakistan of ""repercussions"" on bilateral
ties. The US said the move sends a ""deeply troubling message about Pakistan's
commitment to combatting international terrorism"" and ""belies Pakistani claims
that it will not provide sanctuary for terrorists on its soil.""

Most importantly, they are only accusing Modi for not handling the situation promptly, not as instigated the riots. There is a massive difference between two. (Even Rana Ayyub said the very same in her AMA)",2017-12-17 11:33:54
467,"I hope you are aware of the situation and allegations. At his position as a CM he was supposed to take action instead of staying quiet. He could have done a lot things for e.g. ask center for military forces to help. But he kept quiet. Keeping quiet is as bad as supporting it when you hold a certain position.
And of course no one will have a video of him openly saying that he supported the riots. A simple gesture is enough for people with common sense to understand that what are his(Modi) intentions.",2017-12-17 11:39:02

Development Organisation or DRDO has a great role in realising the 'Make in
India' vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

She was speaking yesterday at a programme organised for 'Transfer of the DRDO
Developed Technologies to Industry' at the Naval Science and Technology
Laboratory (NSTL) in Visakhapatnam.

The Naval Science and Technology Laboratory is a premier naval systems lab of

realising critical defence systems.

""The DRDO has a great role to play in realising the 'Make in India' vision of

The truth is hard to swallow. We have a rot in India and that rot affects the people. *WE DONT VALUE LIFE. LIFE IS WORTHLESS IN INDIA*. Sure, there are good people around but I haven't found them. People use status to feel good about themselves and treat those less fortunate like shit. Indians treat their own fucking living environment like a piece of trash. We are a UNCONCIOUS population that goes by it's instinct and impulses. And there are no realistic ideals that we aspire to. I am personally having a hard time finding something about India that makes me feel good. The only thing I can come up with are books that are written thousands of years ago. 

The only higher truth to this is that humanity has a rot. Everybody. From white people to black,  to asians and Indians to south americans. We are just shit. But this doesn't take from the reality of India and Indians and OUR and YOUR responsibility. 

*I would love to know your ""real truth"" that I can't comprehend because of my low intellect. Please fucking enlighten me.*
