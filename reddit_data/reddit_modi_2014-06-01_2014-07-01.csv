This is not the first time. The 'puppy' remark of Modi or several remarks of Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal is taken out of context. You have the right to be outraged as this has been a long standing problem and especially state like UP should fix their law and order problems (Unfortunately for most of the people it will die down after a week or two.). My simple point it dont let anyone interpret the news for you. News agencies may have biases, they may choose to report or not report certain news, they may interpret the news(to an extent because personal opinions cannot be avoided) but imagination is unacceptable.

Don't believe what all you see on liberal media.

They don't actually believe their method of voting (two parties only) isn't working. If it wasn't working, they wouldn't have a stable democracy for over 75 years (ignoring the beginning of 20th century).

11,"Dear AAP supporters,

Please stop writing self-righteous, smug, condescending letters telling everybody what is right for them. We can think for ourselves. Most people who supported Modi did so because they saw his work in Gujarat and appreciated it. They did it *despite* the media's persistent attempt over the last ten years or so to paint Modi as Hitler and to corner him in 2002 riots. Voting for someone because he has performed well is an excellent reason to for him. Instead of congratulating them for this, you choose to belittle their wisdom as ""manufactured opinion""! 

You know what is a manufactured opinion, you unexperienced, half-baked p.o.s.? The Lokpal bill. 99.99% people who support this bill do so not because they ever studied the bill in detail, or have thought about the problem of corruption with any seriousness, but just because there was a mass-movement which evoked strong feelings that was asking for this bill and which dominated media headlines for months. You want another manufactured opinion? That the lying, manipulative idiot Kejriwal is an honest man. Seriously, what did he ever do to deserve this image? How did he become the icon of honesty? Because media told us so. Just watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEpjDSX3l8U). Now that people have seen enough of him to know that he has nothing constructive to contribute to our polity and have moved on, you say they are ridiculing them because they are told to?

19,"&gt; you don't seem to understand how manufactured opinion works.

Is it manufactured opinion only when there is some big corporate that is creating it? I don't like using this term because it is heavily loaded (basically because of consistent abuse at the hands of idiots who like using catch phrases to lend credibility to their half-thought arguments), but if I had to, I would use it to mean any kind of opinion that has been created through a systematic campaign, with the people who form the said opinion are not convinced by logic or argument but by other means (e.g. media bombardment, groupthink, emotional manipulation etc). 

With that said, there is no question in my mind that the people's opinions regarding Janlokpal bill and Kejriwal are ""manufactured opinions"". Most people had never even heard of either before the massive media coverage of the anti-corruption. People were enraged at the extent of corruption that was getting exposed during UPA rule and the media just fed us with a magic solution that will cure the country of corruption and a messiah that will help us get that magic solution (earlier Anna and then Kejriwal). Media has been hand-in-glove with AAP from the start (Ashutosh, PP Bajpai and Rajdeep come to mind). How is this *not* manufactured opinion?

&gt; Start by looking how much the media hyped Gujarat, and which media did so, and who owns them, and maybe what they have to profit in doing so.

People had started talking about Gujarat much, much before Modi was made the PM candidate in 2013. The first time I had heard about Gujarat was at least 5 years ago when my Uncle (in air force) got transferred to Gujarat and had only the highest adulations for the way the government worked there. Most people had heard some or the other anecdotal stories like that even before the campaign.

Also, I would like to question your (unstated) claim that the media coverage around Gujarat was entirely (or even predominantly) positive. Modi forced the media to talk about Gujarat by harping about his Gujarat model of governance. However, most of the times, IIRC, while media accepted the (undeniable) economic growth story of Gujarat, they usually followed that by accusing the Gujarat model of governance of not being ""inclusive"" and lacking in important human development indices. And who can forget the decade long campaign of the media against Modi vis-a-vis his role in 2002 riots? 

Finally, on the point of business houses funding Modi's campaign and what profit they have in doing so. First of all, I would like to point out, that is itself a manufacture opinion because I can bet my ass that (1) you weren't asking this question before it came up through the AAP propaganda machinery channel, and (2) you haven't really thought about this question on your own at all. If AAP, a political fledgling with ~2% national vote share, can get donations of more than 50 crores in less than a year time, is it that hard to imagine that a mature, national party, which is likely to win elections after 10 years of Congress rule, will find many, many genuine donors? I know a local businessman in Patna who donated 5 crores for Modi's Patna rally alone. People were *really* fed up of Congress misrule man.",2014-06-01 12:20:56

23,"&gt;The buzz inside 10 Janpath is that people will be disillusioned with the Modi government sooner than later and come back to the Congress fold. It is being said that the outcome of the state polls to be held later this year may demonstrate the preference for the grand old party amongst voters as the BJP is bound to falter. The misplaced optimism is based on the presumption that if the party could make a remarkable recovery in the late 1970s when both Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi had lost their seats, why cannot it do so again?",2014-06-01 13:55:39
24,"His brother had challenged Modi ""We'll see how you'll become Wazir-e-Azam (without our support)"". Now BJP has clear majority without a single Muslim MP. I say the BJP should thank Akbaruddin Owaisi for the venom he spewed.

Congratulating whom? He has won the elections, he is the PM. How do congratulations matter?

&gt;You know what is a manufactured opinion, you unexperienced, half-baked p.o.s.? The Lokpal bill. 99.99% people who support this bill do so not because they ever studied the bill in detail, or have thought about the problem of corruption with any seriousness,

Raj Thackeray did say in one of his interviews (either to Arnab or Rajdeep) that he wanted Modi to focus on bettering UP first. Maybe he should have, in his speeches, insulted the Yadavs, Mayawati etc for not bettering their state.

Absolutely nothing justifies avoidable violence. Before you give it the tone of our skirmishes and wars with our neighbours, remember that we were defending our interests when we were attacked first, and we were trying to uphold our integrity. In that case violence was not avoidable.

This is again your opinion. AK is far better than RaGa.. 

&gt;His point is despite everything against Modi, he had something to show to the people. Not hot air.

Tell me one leader in the past thirty years, who has formed a party and won a state election in just one year..

How many years Modi has been politics? How large is BJP? How much money did they spend on elections? Modi was going all over India in a private jet.. AK was taking an overnight to Benares with his family.. it's grossly unfair to compare the two of them.

You show me one leader who has the courage to take on the incumbent parties. Show me one person, who within one year is considered as a third challenger apart from Congress and BJP.

You are comparing this to AK who just launched a party to a party which has been around for decades, which a well oiled machinery working for it, thousands of crores to spend, and leaders who have been in politics for lifetime.

It is very easy to beat a man when he is down.. but learn to admire the courage and self-belief which AK has shown. I am sure we all can learn something from him to better our own career and life.

35,"Inefficient yes, but it is getting better. For India which has a lot of sunshine (and often, much more than needed), putting up solar farms in barren areas will slash the oil bill, and cut down pollution hugely. If solar power is combined with LED lighting, that would help hugely too. I remember reading that if every house in the US switched to LED lighting, they could remove one power station.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_India) is the wiki page on it. I am not saying that Solar power is efficient; I am saying that India has no choice but to go for renewables and solar.

Edit: Just saw the autowikibot's posting below. The 2.1 TeraWatt is where India needs to aim in solar. Of course, it should be treated like railway tracks are, that is, continuously upgraded over decades as the technology evolves.

Edit: to reiterate, solar farms can be situated near population centers because they don't pollute and transmission losses can be minimized. Also slightly off topic, putting a wind turbine on every transmission tower (or something like that) will go a long way too. [Here](http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2009/02/buckminster-fullers-critical-path.html) is an article by Buckminster Fuller, originator of the geodesic dome. Quote:

&gt; Bucky's research led him to conclude that humanity could satisfy 100% of its energy needs while phasing out fossil fuels and nuclear power. In one example, he calculated that **a wind turbine fitted to every high-voltage transmission tower in the US could generate three-and-a-half times the country’s total power output at the time.**

Second, big businesses at our stage of economic development have so far expanded the middle class from 250 million odd in 1991 to 600 million or so today. 40 years of socialism license raj was unable to do anything like that.

Third, none of this will work if our infrastructure (already 50 years behind in quality in most places, and very far behind in quantity) is not in place. Modi (I did not vote for BJP) has to his credit started dismantling the nonsensical logjam already.

&gt; A few days later, the State Department **used a never previously, and never since**, invoked a section of the International Religious Freedom Act to deny Modi's visa for a planned trip to the US -- on the grounds that he was responsible 'for particularly severe violations of religious freedom.'

and:

&gt; Modi's visa denial may have been their coup de main, but a year after the visa brouhaha, a core group comprising Rajagopal, Prabhudoss and a few others -- along with their organisations interchangeably calling themselves Friends of South Asia, Coalition Against Genocide, Coalition Against Communalism and the like -- countered efforts of Hindu Americans to offer modifications to California sixth grade **textbooks that caricatured and misrepresented Hindu beliefs.**

and:

&gt; The antics here at Penn, where I had a front-row seat, found little support in India, with even his prominent detractors admitting that Modi's muzzling **negated the diversity of thought and speech** that should define an Ivy League university.

and:

&gt; Modi's rise is axiomatic in retrospect for many reasons, but the astonishing backfiring of **a carefully plotted vilification campaign** is a story that is only now yielding a bitter harvest. From Capitol Hill to Foggy Bottom and even the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, one hopes for a serious period of reckoning and not retrenchment.

and:

&gt; The tragedy for American diplomacy was compounded by the **absurd bureaucratic inertia in the White House and State Department** that failed to change its policy vis-a-vis Modi substantially even up to the start of elections.

The party had alleged that such diktats were being issued because of the dominance of the Gujarati population in the area. But as the Lok Sabha elections approached and Narendra Modi was chosen the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, the Shiv Sena leadership put an end to its protests on the issue though the party's local cadre had tried to pick it up time and again.

=============

Mr.Anil Bokil, one of the key member of Arthakranti Sansthan was given time to share to PM Modi before recent election. He was given 9min for sharing but Mr.Modi heard him for 2 hrs

Arthakranti Proposal
--

What is Arthakranti Proposal and who hasgiven the proposal?

“Arthakranti Proposal” has been given by a Pune (Maharashtra) based “Arthakranti Sansthan” which is an Economic Advisory body constituted by a group of Chartered Accountants and Engineers. This funda has been patented by the Sansthan

Arthakranti Proposal is an effective and guaranteed solution of Black Money Generation, Price rise and Inflation, Corruption, Fiscal Deficit, Unemployment, Ransom, GDP and industrial growth, terrorism and good governance

What is in the Proposal ?
---
“Arthakranti Proposal has FIVE point of actions simultaneously

(1) Scrap all 56 Taxes including income tax excluding import duty

(2) Recall and scrap high denomination currencies of 1000, 500 and 100 rupees

(3) All high value transaction to be made only through banking system like cheque, DD, online and electronic

(4) Fix limit of cash transaction and no taxing on cash transaction

(5) For Govt. revenue collection introduce single point tax system through banking system – Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) on only Credit Amount

Important Points to note:
---
(1) As on today total banking transaction is more than 2.7 lakh crores per day say more than 800 lakh crores annually

(2) Less than 20% transaction is made through banking system as on today and more than 80% transaction made in cash only, which is not traceable

(3) 78% of Indian population spend less than 20/- rupees daily why they need 1000/- rupee note

What will happen if All FIFTY SIX Taxes including income tax scrapped :
---

(1) Salaried people will bring home more money which will increase purchasing power of the family

(2) All commodities including Petrol, Diesel, FMCG will become cheaper by 35% to 52%

(3) No question of Tax evasion so no black money generation

(4) Business sector will get boosted. So self employment

What will happen if 1000/ 500/ 100 Rupees currency notes recalled and scrapped :
---

(1) Corruption through cash will stopped 100%

(2) Black money will be either converted to white or will vanish as billions of 1000/500/100 currency notes hidden in bags without use will become simple pieces of papers

(3) Unaccounted hidden huge cash is skyrocketing the prices of properties, land, houses, jewellery etc and hard earned money is loosing its value; this trend will stop immediately

(4) Kidnapping and ransom, “Supari killing” will stop

(5) Terrorism supported by cash transaction will stop

(6) Cannot buy high value property in cash showing very less registry prices

(7) Circulation of “Fake Currency” will stop because fake currency printing for less value notes will not be viable

What will happen when Banking Transaction Tax (2% to 0.7%) is implemented :
---

(1) As on today if BTT is implemented govt can fetch 800 x 2% = 16 lakh crore where as current taxing system is generating less than 14 lakh crore revenue

(2) When 50% of total transaction will be covered by BTT sizing 2000 to 2500 lakh crores, Govt will need to fix BTT as low as 1% to 0.7% and this will boost again banking transaction many fold

(3) No separate machinery like income tax department will be needed and tax amount will directly deposited in State/Central/District administration account immediately

(4) As transaction tax amount will be very less, public will prefer it instead paying huge amount against directly/indirectly FIFTY SIX taxes

(5) There will be no tax evasion and govt will get huge revenue for development and employment generation

(6) For any special revenue for special projects, govt can slightly raise BTT say from 1% to 1.2% and this 0.2% increase will generate 4,00,000 crores additional fund

Effect if implemented today :
---

(1) Prices of all things will come down

(2) Salaried people will get more cash in hand

(3) Purchasing power of Society will increase

(4) Demand will boost, so will production and industrialisation and ultimately more employment opportunity for youth

(5) Surplus revenue to the govt for effective health/ education/ infrastructure/ security/ social works

(6) Cheaper and easy loans from banks, interest rate will come down

161,"The anti-Modi endorsement and the erasing of Kashmir is just the tip of the iceberg. A far larger problem is extremely high level of anti-Hindu prejudice at the Economist:

Examples of TE articles with name and publication date:

**1) “Bitter Fruit”, Aug 2008:** Article exercises double standard by calling relatively peaceful J&amp;K's Hindu minority protester “Militant” and aggressive J&amp;K's Muslim Majority protester “Protester”.

**2) “An uphill walk”, Sept 2012:** Amarnath pilgrimage is called “INVASION”.

**3) “Kashmir’s future: Fleeting Chance”, July 2011;”An uphill walk”, Sept 2012, “Bitter Fruit”, Aug 2008:** Amarnath shrine called “penis-shaped lump of ice”.

**4) “Shaking the mountains”, Dec 2010:** Article states that Amarnath pilgrims are unmolested; However, nothing can be further from truth. Amarnath pilgrims were massacred on several occasions. For instance, on August 2nd 2000, 34 pilgrims were murdered by terrorist who attacked makeshift pilgrim tents.

**5) “The Hindu rate of self-deprecation”, April 2011:** The title itself is unjustly anti-hindu. Both,red tape and corruption, are legacy of Nehruvian Socialism (that itself inherited the red-tape of the British Raj aimed at generating more stamp revenue for the Raj) and has nothing to do with Hinduism but Economist does not blame Nehruvian license, quota, permit raj. Instead, it cleverly abuses Hindus.

**6) “In search of a dream”, Sept 2012; “Now finish the job” April 2012; “The Hindu rate of self-deprecation”, April 2011:** Economist refers to India’s socialist era GDP growth rate as “Hindu rate of growth”.



**7) “The Swami’s Curse”, June 2011:** Article indirectly describes Ayurveda and Yoga as quack cures. Personally, I am neither a follower nor a supporter of Baba Ramdev and Lokpal movement but I was shocked by the tone, tenure, bias and foul language of the article.

I dare the Economist to publish an article called ""The Jewish rate of self-deprecation"" or ""The Imam's curse"". Hindus are an easy target because we generally don't react caustically to aspersions on our faith. There are exceptions of course but we are overall a peaceful bunch.

**8) Economist has many articles on Kashmir like Nov. 2010:** “The K Word”. They almost always omits “The P Word” (i.e., indirectly deny/downplay Hindu Pandit Plight). Only once “The P Word” was reluctantly mentioned.

**9) In 2012/2013 year, Economist has many articles on Bangladesh war crime trial &amp; political crisis:** Most articles condemn the war crime trial, attack the evidence, and question eyewitness account. The omissions and commissions, of this articles, indirectly deny/downplay 1971 Hindu Genocide (est. 500,000 to 1,500,000 Hindu civilians killed by the Pakistani Army), and 2012/2013 attacks on Hindus.

**10) Economist has printed many articles about Ayodhya dispute:** Almost all articles omit/suppress entire history and deny archeological evidence. **Example, Oct 2010 article “The uneasy split”** falsely claims that “there is no archaeological evidence to support either belief”; However, nothing can be further from truth. Archeological evidence of Hindu temple is a fact proven beyond reasonable doubt in UP’s high court.

**12) “Witchcraft in Assam Toil and trouble”, April 2012:** Article touts superiority and rationality of Islam and Christianity, dismisses native beliefs as superstition, and omits social reforms carried out by mainstream Hindu organisation like Rama-Krishna mission.

**13) “Shadow of a darker decade”, Aug 2012:** This article is directly and indirectly justifying the latest Muslim violence in Mumbai based on bogus accusations and numbers.Firstly, Economist claimed that ""In 1992,Muslims were targeted by Hindu-nationalist mobs and hundreds were killed"" but, in reality, Islamist, who got angry in wake of demolition at Ayodhya, started targeting Hindus. In first 2 days( January 6 and 7 1992) of rioting, 34 Hindus and 8 Muslims got killed, 138 Hindus and 34 Muslims were injured. On January 8 1992 at 0030 hours, 6 Hindus, including 5 women, residing at Radhabai Chawl were burnt alive. Radhabai Chawl massacre triggered hindu backlash. Official death toll is 900 (575 Muslims, 275 Hindus, 45 unknown and 5 others). Secondly,About 2002 Gujarat riots,. Economist wrote ""2,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed"" but here are the factual numbers: 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.

(*) All numbers cited are from official government reports published by Justice SriKrishna Commission for Mumbai, and parliament report for Gujarat.

**14) “Bleak House” , March 2012:** The riots only started after the incident where Muslims burned 59 Hindus in Coach S6 of the Shabarmati Express. The article cleverly tries to blame Hindu victims of Godhra train massacre for their death, indirectly suggests that nearly nil (official number 254) Hindus died in subsequent riots, and exercises double standards.

The Economist stealthily planted a seed of doubt on Godhra verdict, and it keeps alive canards like ""dispute"" and ""accident"". The truth is that there was no major dispute which would spark such a horrific massacre. 

Only an extremely prejudiced media would try to dismiss fire started in the middle of an attack as mere accident, and indirectly absolve Muslim attackers of all responsibility. 

It puts active efforts to not let the readers know that 31 Muslims have been CONVICTED for conspiracy and murder for the premeditated burning of Hindu women and children in the Godhra train attack. This after careful investigations and free &amp; fair trials that have already proven guilt beyond reasonable doubt.


**Brown sepoys can make-up all sorts of bullshit excuses for each of these documented cases of anti-Hindu bias at The Economist (or The Guardian/NYT/BBC for that matter). However, Hinduphobia is the only succinct and parsimonious explanation. Remember Occam's razor.**

The other stuff comes from equating the ability of the majority to oppress the minority. This results in coverage which emphasizes the chance of misuse of power by the majority (Hindus). This isn't condoning the reporting though, just pointing out the bias in this case.

223,"When Mulayam said ""Boys will be boys"" in Moradabad in a very specific context.

Moradabad has a huge population of Muslims and his rally's audience was mostly Muslim.

2 days before he made that comment, there was a conviction in Mumbai. 5 men were sentenced to death for a gang rape. 4 out of those 5 were Muslims and 3 out of those 4 were from Moradabad.

That was the context in which he made the comments: ""Boys will be boys."" ""Boys make mistakes and that poor boy gets a death sentence.""

He wasn't condoning rape. He was just pandering and appeasing his Muslim audience. 

That's the context which was unreported in most media.

Now consider Akhilesh's recent comments and the UP government's impotent inaction. Look at its context as well.

Most of the victims are Dalits and most of the perpetrators are Yadavs. The Yadavs along with the Muslims are the SP's main voter base.

This upsurge in rape is essentially the Yadavs punishing powerless Dalits for voting for the BJP and Modi (instead of their traditional parties SP and BSP) in the recent elections.

Do you think Akhilesh really condones these rapes? Not at all. But he's powerless and knows that he cannot take any action against his (already depleted) voter base.

What kind of law is this?Benefits any party?Can you be specific?No wonder bureaucracy was corrupt in UPA days .

Anybody has any more doubt he doesn't care for people?

&gt;**Another message was to simplify procedures and cut paperwork by weeding out ""outdated and archaic rules, which, instead of serving the process of governance, are leading to unnecessary confusion"".** The PM suggested the secretaries make a beginning by cleaning up offices to ""improve the workplace, which would automatically improve work culture"".

Agree.

&gt;When people are displaced by land development (dams, industry, new cities) they're actually taken care of unlike in India where they're basically told to go fuck themselves.

False. If anything the Chinese govt does the whole, ""go fuck yourselves"" shtick. Take even the 3 Gorges dam, they simply evicted people living there for 1000's of years and the people had zero choice in that matter. No court hearings, no stay orders, none of that stuff. Yes, in terms of recovery and over all well being, they would do much better than the average Indian slum dweller shunted out to make way for a highway.

Agree.

&gt;But we have ""freedoms"" so there's that. I am being cynical, but if you've ever been to China it's just incredibly hard to be optimistic about anything in our country

Really? Freedoms on paper never translate well into reality in India and most other 3rd world nations. Sure, I can post shit about MMS or Modi on my FB wall, a paper might write an Op-Ed abusing the ruling party...but do we (the average Indian) truly have freedom in this nation? Take Badun, the cops at first basically told the parents of the kids to bugger off, and only because of the gruesome nature of the crime and the media attention are things moving. If maybe they hadn't been hanged to death and media hadn't caught on, the kids and their parents would be powerless and freedom less in the face of an oppressive bureaucracy!

&gt;but if you've ever been to China it's just incredibly hard to be optimistic about anything in our country

I actually have. I have travelled to Chengdu, had a couple of MBA batch mates who were mainland Chinese, and I don't know man, if there is one key difference I spot in the attitudes of those I interacted with? It is the overwhelming sense of belief and pride in being Chinese and in a near certainty that they will own the coming century. It is unexplainable, but constant and all pervasive. Maybe it is the wrong demographic that I have been talking about, and am sure the poor farmer in the Xinjiang region would feel otherwise...or not.

About Modi, see we are all realists, nobody is expecting him to turn India into a first world power in 5 years, but what we want for a start is a functioning government that has the interests of the collective good in mind and not subversient to the whims and wishes of one woman and her family. 

We want him to lay the foundations for reform - labour law reform, power sector reform, ease the red-tape strangling every single aspect of life in India.

We want him to push development to the fore and only that or lack of it should decide electoral mandates - the Indian people have been doing this consistently well for the past 3-4 years though...rejecting freebies &amp; largely voting for cleaner development based parties (even if they are 2,3 times incumbent), I think this momentum will sustain and the system will itself cleanse itself of the filth of stuff like caste / religion based voting which allows scum like Mulayam and his son to thrive. Will this happen now? Certainly not. Will it happen in the next 10-15 years? Yes.

Change is finally coming to this so far benighted land.",2014-06-05 18:57:47
306,"yes. i thought you had more depth than this.

anyway. Modi is a hell of a speaker with a following that deeply believes in him - i really don't need to mention this. a message from him as head of state seems like it would be extremely effective in sending something into the heads of all the impressionable youngsters who deeply believe in him as a leader. i believe that given Modi's impressive charisma and what he has achieved out of it so far, he can actually be a very effective agent for change in social behaviour. if he actually decided to give rape and discrimination on the basis of the caste system and gender a priority and gave some strong speeches, made a twitter/facebook campaign, would it energize his followership in making some real change? i think yes.

yes of course rural (and even urban) development is a necessary step and i do hope this govt is able to deliver, it would be a wonderful thing. however, that is a longer term strategy, just as education, healthcare etc. at the moment, we do need some strict and swift action taken about UP and the way its ""leaders"" are behaving.

one must not dismiss the media that lightly. without their sensationalism (even if it is for a noxious reason such as TRPs), i doubt we'd have had this much outrage all over. the thing is, victims are afraid, deathly afraid to go to the police. with the way media has been covering it incessantly, we have all started talking about the issue amongst ourselves. victims might actually think that it is ok to speak out. i think that the increase in the number of rape cases is a reflection of the increase in reporting, and this is in part due to the amount of exposure rape is getting in the media.",2014-06-05 18:59:23

People of Maharashtra respect Modi in a same way they respect Virat Kohli or Abdul Kalam,but they are dead serious when it comes to Shivaji Maharaj. Anything happens on that front has absolutely nothing to do with BJP or Congress. Let's not narrow down this Shivaji-phenomenon to BJP Vs. Congress Vs.

2. This man was killed in a Cong NCP ruled state but the no word blaming the State Govt in the media! But if this had happened in BJP ruled State then BJP would have been blamed!

3. As usual Modi is being dragged into this- when neither the BJP or Modi is involved in this! Did anyone write an article titled ""Manmohan Singh should reign in right wing hooligans"" when Tasleema Nasreen was publicly attacked by Owaisi's men in Andhra and Owaisi was an ally of the Congress then?

4. Many Hindus were attacked or killed by Muslims when Muslms protested against issues happening outside India.Did the Secular media identify the killed by titles like"" Hindu killed by Muslim organisation members?

5. And finally isn't the communal mindset of the Secularists clear when they have conveniently ignored the latest Owaisi hate speech against India's PM Modi and have raked up a muder of a Muslim in a riot provoked by denigration of Shivaji and Thackeray on Facebook in a Cong NCP ruled State?

6. When Muslim gangs ran amock and set fire to Secular Media vehicles, desecrated the Amar Jawan Jyoti and molested almost a dozen women police officers in Azad Maidan ,in the same Maharashtra under the same Cong NCP rule did the Secular Media and FP write an article ""Manmohan Singh should reign in Musalim hooligans? NO? Why?

7. And why did the Secular media ""carefully "" omit the word Muslim from the headlines when reporting the violence at Azad Maidan?

8. Why is it that when Hindu groups indulge in violence they are called Hindu fanatics,hooligans,thugs,fascists but when Muslims indulge in violence they become just ""mob"" ""protestors' and ""crowd""? Why the fear or hesitation to mention the religion of those indulging in violence then?

9. Why afer so many incidents of violence in the past did we not see a single article in the Secular Media titled"" Why MMSingh should reign in Muslim fanatics?

No Hindu will justify the murder of any innocentman-whether he is from Hindu Muslim or any other religion . But this sort of shameless Secular-that is anti Hindu attitude will only help making more and more Hindus turn hardliners!

You must have understood by now what shameless anti Hindu attitude of the Media vis a vis Modi and BJP has resulted in!

An example of Secularism- Muslim ""Secularist"" Shabana called those who sent a plane ticket to Ananthamurthy as Lunatics because they were Hindus. How many times have you heard her say anything like that about Muslims who molested women police officers or attacked or murdered Hindus?

In Gadkari's case he was probed and eventually cleared by the IT department.

I actually do think there is something shady about Gadkari's company, but Kejriwal should be taking the logical approach, highlighting known facts and using legal means to press for a more detailed investigation instead of doing jail bharo andolans and having his cohorts go door-to-door screaming *'Gadkari chor hai!'*",2014-06-06 18:49:53

I don't think I said 'obvious'. But you surely ignored it and then distorted it.

&gt;Looking in the mirror? Because you certainly aren't paying me any compliments.

I suppose you cant expect a compliment after you have abused someone.

&gt;Gadkari. Investigated and cleared.

[Gadkari was never investigated by the IT department.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gadkari-was-never-focus-of-our-probe-I-T-department-says/articleshow/35138758.cms) Apart from Income Tax Act, there were various allegations of contravention of Companies Act, Prevention of Corruption Act and FCRA which were never looked into.

&gt;Yeddy. Cleared by Karnataka High Court; now even Lokayukta Santosh Hedge endorses Modi

It is very strange that you would bring up Yeddy to prove your point. It was Santosh Hegde who convicted Yeddy. So there was no political interference. If you think Hegde is a man of integrity then Yeddy is guilty. If you believe the High Court is right, then Hegde is wrong. I let your better judgement decide who among them is correct. Apart from that, there are several cases pending against him in the HC and SC.

&gt;Arun Jaitley. unnecessarily probed by CBI for 2G, nothing found

The law states that the burden of proof is on Gadkari to show libelous cause. Making statements from information in public domain is not libel. Never has been libel and any lawyer worth his salt will tell you not the convert a libel case into a criminal one because the onus lies on the prosecution. 

&gt; I see AAP has a well-oiled social network of stalkers around. Did Somnath Bharti train you, out of curiousity?

Since you are curious, the person who trained me to *stalk* (whatever the F that means on a public forum) is Amit Shah and Modi gave guest lectures. Modi seems to have a PhD in it and Amit Shah a Masters degree.

441,"Well I had submitted my name for the voter list, but for some reason, it didn't show up there, and I didn't get the chance to vote. Even if I did get the chance, I'd've voted for AAP instead of BJP.
The reason why not vote for BJP was because Modi has a great PR campaign. He's been extremely careful to make sure there isn't much bad said about him. I don't know for sure whether he's done this the right way or not, but you never know.

He's a great administrator and I will give him that. I think him becoming PM is good for the country at this juncture, and definitely better than Congress ruling once more. However, what I fear is the BJP. It's not just Modi ruling India, it's BJP. So even if Modi has the untarnished image that people have for him, the rest of the politicians in the party are not the same. They have their own agendas. For example, Nitin Gadkari got implicated for owning a lot of property in other names, those who were close to him (so indirectly, he owned the property). However, he's now the Transport Minister.

There are many other scenarios such as this, and even now I'm skeptical. Modi is one man, but the party may not always go by his words, now that they have achieved what they wanted. It's all about personal gain.

He's making all the right noises right now, but this is a 5 year road. It's not going to be easy, and I'm still skeptical of how far he'll be able to get corruption out, and get the economy going even higher, take out poverty.",2014-06-07 05:52:47

I didn't vote for Modi because of Modi's supporters. Although Modi's campaign was hardly based on Hindutva, his supporters made it seem like it was. They've certainly been emboldened by his rise.

I'm agnostic; I don't like the idea of religion mixing with the state. I have zero patience for religious rhetoric, whether it is Hindutva or Christianity or whatever. 

I saw no political party I could identify with. AAP had retarded economic policies. Congress is the piece of shit that's been clogging India's drains. BJP and its religious leanings goes against my political ideology.

But having said that, I've been really impressed the way Modi has conducted himself since his election. His actions so far have been magnanimous and reconciliatory. He's also made a conscious effort to not mix religion and state so far. The fact that the likes of Swamy don't have a place in the cabinet is really encouraging.

I'll vote for Modi if:

* He keeps religion out of the state as he has done so far.
* He invests in the country's infrastructure. 10 years of UPA has destroyed whatever gains we made in the Vajypaee era.
* He ensures electricity and drinking water is available across the country.


Mostly, I don't care if he makes bullet trains or sets up 100 IITs and whatnot. I'll be very, very happy if we can have 100% electricity and water distribution, and if our roads aren't complete crap.

481,"Not opposing bail is not the same as dropping investigations. Everyone but the most dangerous criminals are entitled to bail.

Dayalu Ammal is not an active politician or a business woman, she's just someone propped up as a director to meet govt.  requirements. (This is a very common thing in all companies, since until last year you needed 2 directors / shareholders for a private limited company. So if you wanted to start a business and doing all the hard work for it, why would you want to give away shares to a stranger? So you just get your wife/mother/daughter etc. or some other family member you trust will not act against you to be the other shareholder/directory. It makes more sense for it to be a woman, because they get better tax breaks (and also the misogynistic reason that they are under someone's ""control"".)


&gt;Wah re Modi.

Modi runs the executive branch of the government. The judiciary/courts are not and will never be under his control. It's up to the courts to grant bail or not. Even if the govt. prosecutor agrees to the bail, the judge can refuse it and the judge can deny bail even if the govt. prosecutor demands otherwise.",2014-06-07 18:04:50
482,"Sorry late to the thread...per se, I have high hopes from modi and he has not disappointed so far. But to me, he was very much culpable for the riots. This msn went about saying the riots were a Congress conspiracy as much as six months after the incidents. That's not the way a responsible CM works.Will I vote for him if he gets India to soaring heights this term? I don't think so.. Its a conscientious decision. Its like asking if you can forgive China for the Tiananmen square massacre because  the govt gas actively focused on development since then. I hope people like Modi get India to reach yet full potential. But I won't vote for him. There are other honest, diligent and master politicians too in this 1.2 billion person country and I will vote for them.Elections are not about gambling on the winning horse. Rather its about picking a person who is capable of delivering what people want. And there are people other than Modi to choose from.",2014-06-07 18:56:02

487,"&gt; Love and affection for a leader often turns into a personality cult that can damage an organisation and the leader himself. This is what appears to be happening to our Party.” Yogendra Yadav in a letter to fellow AAP members.

Looks like many of us saw it coming. AK is an opportunist. He used and dumped Hazare. He started out on a crusade on corruption, but then decided to go after the only non-corrupt political star Modi, training his guns on the alleged communalism. He got the chance to govern Delhi, then ran away.

Even in his government career, he had a similar trait: From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal#Early_career):

&gt; Kejriwal joined the IRS in 1995 after qualifying through the Civil Services Examination. In 2000, he **was granted two years' paid leave** to pursue higher education **on condition that upon resuming his work he would not resign from the Service for at least three years.** Failure to abide by that condition would require him to repay the salary given during the leave period. He rejoined in 2003 and worked for 18 months before taking unpaid leave for 18 months. In February 2006, he resigned from his position as a Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi. The **Government of India claimed that Kejriwal had violated his original agreement** by not working for three years. Kejriwal said that his 18 months of work and 18 months of unpaid absence amounted to the stipulated three year period during which he could not resign and that this was an attempt to malign him due to his involvement with Team Anna, a strand of the Indian anti-corruption movement. The dispute ran for several years until, in 2011, it was resolved when **he paid his way out of the Service with the help of loans from friends.**

2) It wouldn't satisfy the critics anyway; they'd ask for Modi to personally condemn the incident, visit the victim's family, and grab a sword and chop off the head of the Hindu Rashtra Sena chief to prove his commitment to secularism
