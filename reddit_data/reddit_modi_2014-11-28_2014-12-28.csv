11,"More media outlets have published details about how this story developed. Now the things are becoming clear:

1. Every year, EC makes a list of duplicate _names_ to find duplicate _voters_. E.g. There might be hundreds of ""Rajesh Singh"", ""Anita Yadav"", ""Ajay Shukla"", ""Sita Devi"" or ""Amit Kumar"". This year, EC used a new software to come up with this list of duplicate _names_, which it would later use to find duplicate _voters_. Last year, EC's list of duplicate _names_ contained 91 lakh _names_. This year's list had 98 lakh _names_.
1. Jagran was the first newspaper which published the news. It didn't mention Modi and used the word ""duplicate"" (not ""fake""). However, the reporter completely misunderstood EC's statement. EC had actually stated that it has found lakhs of duplicate _names_  (not duplicate _voters_) using its new software. Using these names, it was in process of determining which of these duplicate _names_ indicate duplicate _voters_.
1. AAP posted a link to the Jagran story on its Facebook page. The post also included a poster which included Narendra Modi's picture and claimed that lakhs of ""fake"" (not ""duplicate"") _voters_ had been uncovered by EC in Varanasi.
1. Navbharat Times picked up this news from AAP's facebook page, and published it without verifying it.
1. AAP's social media wing trended the Navbharat Times story for 2 days under the tag #MufflerMan.
1. Other media outlets, including ABP News, Aaj Tak, Amar Ujala and Rajasthan Patrika picked up this news, and once again, published it without verifying the authenticity.
1. NDTV actually went to Varanasi and talked to the EC officers mentioned in the original Jagran story. The officers explained that Jagran reporter had completely misunderstood their statements. By this time, they had determined that there were around 26,664 potentially duplicate _voters_ in Varanasi. There are similar figures for other districts.

This despite the fact that majority of students in college are non-vegetarians (the only thing article got right).

The reason was chicken we were being supplied was of really shitty quality. Even non-vegetarian students didn't want to eat it. However it raised the semester mess bill by substantial amount for all the students. So it was decided chicken would be removed from the menu. There are plenty of outlets in and around the campus if someone wants to eat non-veg food.

&gt;* In a significant development, the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has returned to the state government the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Laws (Amendment) Bill-2011 for various clarifications.
&gt;* The Centre has asked for a number of clarifications before sending it for the President's approval.
&gt;* Sources said that the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Laws (Amendment) Bill-2011 was passed by the state legislature but after the then Governor of the state refused her consent, it was sent for the President consideration.
&gt;* Now Prime Minister Modi's government too has returned it for clarifications before sending it for President's approval.

123,"Okey, so here I can share an interesting incident (unrelated to Modi, but related to Vastu)

 
 
One businessman came to my uncle (Civil Consultant) for consultation about Vastu.I happened to be there at that time. He had built his house (big bungalow actually) 4-5 years ago but Vastu Shastris somehow convinced him that there are serious faults and are dangerous for him/his family and all that shits. He was about to do serious changes in his house (almost like building from scratch), because it was not Vastu - compliant.

He came to my uncle, being childhood friends, for a final advice. I have seen several times, my uncle trying to convince people not to go for Vastu, and instead , build what they need with fresh air and light. But most people just don't accept building house without Vastu. 
So, my uncle (and me) visited his house. It was nicely built as far as I can tell. So, my uncle started talking casually, 

1) Do you have any problem in your house ?

2) Is anybody seriously ill or something ?

3) Hows business doing, and job of son ?

4) Hows family of son ? grandchildren are healthy/happy ?

5) Is there any other serious problem you are facing ?

6) And few other general life related questions.

And trust me, in every response , he said positive things. My uncle, who knew, he is gonna destroy his building for sake of Vastu, irrespective of how we convince him, said him in a language he understands :"" If everything is fine, all are doing well, health is good, financials are no problem etc, why are you trying to go against God's will (upar wala to be precise). May be he (God) likes you irrespective of location of your kitchen/bathroom.""..and some more talks like this.

There are lots of things wrong with Islam and it is true that they are a fundamentalist religion. But so are many many other religious sects. In a religion with a billion followers there are bound to be a lot of extremists. It's also true that Islam needs a reformation, and it has a lot of values that just don't make any sense anymore and belong in the middle ages. That doesn't mean Islam as a whole is a ""threat"". There's a big difference between criticism and irrational fear and hate. You fall in the latter.

2) if you ride horse, and father walking, people say what kind of son are you making your father walk..

3) if you both sit on a horse, people will call you assholes for not thinking about the weight on poor horse..

4) if you both start walking with the horse without riding it, people will say you guys are dumbfucks who bought the horse for no reason and are just walking..

moral of the story: people will find ways to find faults, so don't listen to them and do what you think you are suppose to do..

 PMO speech has got nothing to do with AAP.

Did I ask you to criticize? No - let me do it. The reason I criticize the metaphor is because when a person in power uses superstitious beliefs it tends to lend credence to them. Now, if you are unable to see that point fine. Lets agree to disagree - don't bring in AAP, Kejriwal etc.

&gt; Sorry but I am not as euphoric as you folk. All my older relatives say, Rama or Krishna when they are exasperated, 

Your logical fallacy is - False Equivalence. Your old relatives do not get prime time TV on national TV. Neither are your old relatives, in position of power and able to influence **atleast** 30% of the national population. The other day you were giving a lecture on pragmatism and Indian polity. What happens to that here? A significant percentage of the Indian population are indeed naive and are influenced by politicians. Show some consistency! In that context, I reserve my right to criticize the use of a superstitious belief to be used for a political speech. I thought you'd be on board because well the current government is on a *development agenda*. 

&gt; maybe we should line them up on the Red Fort walls and shoot them for the sin of being...communal?

Don't take this personally, but you are getting a bit annoying with the digressions and hyperbole. Did I ask Modi to be round on Red fort walls for and shoot him? Did I say Modi was communal? Don't connect non-existent dots and indulge in Olympic level mental gymnastics. FWIW, I criticize my mom and my siblings when they use superstitious beliefs to make the point. Criticism based on superstitious beliefs doesn't mean I am insinuating someone to be communal or that they have *sinned*.

We will have to agree to disagree because, and I am going to link my euphoric comment here, the vast (and I mean overwhelming) majority of our countrymen don't think the way you or I do. Modi has a duty almost to reach out to them too, as the biggest fuck up by MMS and even PVN was that they ignored the toiling masses and spoke the arcane language of economics and party politics (MMS didn't do this also). Modi connects, and that is his strength.

When you talk to a 10 year old and a 19 year old and a 33 year old, would you use the exact same terminology, rhetoric etc? If you do, you won't be getting your message across.

Also, the same gang railing on this (as though one Tweet will make billions become Vaastu believers) railed on his Swach Bharat campaign, saying empty speeches, nothing will change etc. See the inconsistency here? This is criticism for criticism's sake.

225,"Left ""*liberals*"" view the world as black and white. In their scheme of things what they believe in is always right and what is contrary to their views is always wrong. Which is why they are quick to condemn the daughter of a deceased BJP politician getting an election ticket but find Santosh Koli's brother getting a ticket post her death praiseworthy. The fact that both were political considerations to gather sympathy vote is immaterial to them. What BJP does has to be wrong and what AAP does has to be right. On the same lines Modi doing a Ganga aarti becomes *communal* while Kejriwal taking a dip in the river remains *cultural*. 

This left liberal lot is the erstwhile Congress support group. UPA-2's tenure left them with little scope to openly support the party and with AAP on the horizon they lapped up to their new leader pretty quickly. NDA has given them little reason to be critical so they have to innovate newer ways to someohow convince themselves that Modi turned out to be the second coming of Hitler just like they had predicted. They will leave no stone unturned to criticize him and the BJP, even if that means taking statements out of context, dissing our cultural heritage or even the electoral process. Remember how suddenly post BJP's victory the 'first past the post' system came under severe criticism?

The press release was 6 hours AFTER tweet. I based my comment on the PMOIndia tweet not some third party account. There are multiple times I have indeed waited (Rajnath Heisenberg thread is on example) before making a judgment. But, here I decided to trust the official PMOIndia account.

&gt; When you talk to a 10 year old and a 19 year old and a 33 year old, would you use the exact same terminology, rhetoric etc? If you do, you won't be getting your message across.

I would definitely not based my argument based on superstition. There are more cogent ways of driving a point rather than basing it on superstitious belies.

It was not a tweet, it was a speech. Skepticism doesn't equate to criticism. There are some people who indeed are but for me I am cautious about the Swacch Bharat initiative. I still think it is a good campaign but it has to go beyond Oct 2 speeches and photo ops. I don't think I'm wrong in that.

Every single PM from Nehru on till even ABV ignored this most vital region, and it is heartening to see the thrust the NDA has here. A silly one liner? I really don't care.

It isn't either or. I do agree that NDA has done more for the N-E region than any other government. One of the reasons ABVP is one of my favorite PMs. To ignore the 1-liner is your prerogative, to not ignore it is mine. Next time, do also ignore such silly 1liner speeches from Rahul Gandhi too.

I would just request people to not set the benchmark of previous government and other parties if that were the case the mandate would have been different, there were a lot of promises and hope give by modi during elections and it was really uplifting. Has he been delivering what was promised in the manifesto ? Well its too early to say that. Is everything going in the direction as promised? No I don't think so.

Recently, my area witnessed its 1st riot in last 50 years b/w Hindu &amp; Muslims. in the festival of Flag (Jhanda ka mela) few Hindus started pelting stones on nearby Mosque and looted the shops of Muslims. In the process, bike of my cousin was burnt, thankfully, he ran away from there in the meantime. He's just a 15 years old kid who had gone in there to see the Orchestra of dancers in the Jhanda ka mela.


The riot was orchestrated by aspiring BJP MLA candidate and local RSS leaders. RSS people are full of hatred. My best friend's elder brother happens to be an investment banker and a RSS/BJP member. Time to time, he spills venom on Muslims. One time, he even abused me for being Muslim yet my friend took on his brother and supported me. That is true secularism.



Recently RSS head went to Meerut and said Muslims were involved in Love-Jihad. Finally the truth has come out that it was just about two individuals who loved each other and shared different religion. It's only after losing the bypolls in UP, they realized that they can't fan more religious riots.

259,"&gt;  land swapping agreement

great you asked. I will try and answer

 Its a complicated situation of India-Bangladesh borders . Its a pending issue of land blocks and Indian nationals living on them. They are named as chitmahals. The issue is pending since independence and hasnt been resolved even when bangladesh got independence. 

It was reported to the Home Minister that over 2 lakh Indian nationals had been undergoing, extreme hardships at 387 small “chitmahals” inside Bangladesh and in the Indo-Bangladesh border areas in the Tinbigha corridor and Berubari, whom neither the Centre nor the Bangladesh Government had given any recognition.[1] 

As a result, The residents of the enclaves live in poor conditions, with a lack of water, roads, electricity, schools and medicines. Crime also is rampant, as complaining would mean crossing the international boundary due to the lack of law enforcement resources. Residents of the enclaves may go to their respective countries only on the production of an identity card, after seeking permission from the border guards, causing much resentment. Recently the countries have moved towards an agreement to absorb the enclaves, but the resulting nationality of the current residents remains an impediment, as it could have implications for border disputes in other parts of the region [2]

Now, the BJP and asam gana parishad have been trying for this. Assam govt and people feel that the centre is trying to sell their land to bangladesh and has opposed this proposal.[3] 

Modi aims to close the routes to bangladesh once the pact is inked thus crubbing Infiltration to a large extent. right now the borders are porous because of these enclaves and we cannot do anything about it. [4]

&gt;Yes this is ""secularism"" because these Muslims came out to say they aren't all terrorists and Muslim madrasas aren't terrorist training camps

Admirable intention, yet the timing smacks of political opportunism. Given what we know about Mamata, and her base pandering to Islamic elements (including the hardcore Jihadi's), this seems more of a politically motivated rally then one motivated by more prosaic principles.

&gt;&gt;At least 11 policemen — including three IPS officers — were injured in brickbatting and 13 police vehicles damaged. Journalists were attacked for ""intruding on the space meant for rallyists""

&gt;&gt;Taken by surprise, police simply stood by and let some 2 lakh Jamiat supporters run amok in the heart of Kolkata. Even bylanes in south and central Kolkata were clogged. For hours, police had no control over a 3sqkm area besieged by the rallyists. When the cops did try to restore order, they came under attack. News crews were roughed up, too, and a van of 24Ghanta damaged. 

Stuff like this honestly does not even send the message it wants to send.

&gt;Oh and Jamiat =/= Jamaat. In a state with 25% Muslims, you can't really force them never to stage a rally AGAINST terrorism.

TIL - I thought they were the same ideological cousins of the monsters who slaughtered between half a million to a million Hindus in B'desh. 

&gt;Personally, I hate identity politics in general. I think madrasas should be phased out because kids there do not receive proper education contributing to their lower socio-economic level. I think Islamism is a cancer in Islam.

I disagree there, if one took the model of Senegal as an example, there kids attend 3 hours of Madrassa a week BUT it is tempered by 40 hours of modern French based education a week.

It is ones prerogative to send their kids to Madrassas or Bible schools, as long as the crazy does not overtake the rational, it should not be touched.

&gt;Gradually Islam and Muslims should be reformed on the whole. But if we try to force it, we will see increased terrorism. Do we really want that ?

I don't disagree, my issue was more with the flaming ""liberals"" here who take such umbrage over fake news such as half a million fake voters in Varanasi or this one but aside from a few, don't even bother to show up in any of these threads.

&gt;In that thread I posted that the statement had good intentions, but there was really no need to embrace woo. The majority government is always held to the highest standard and petty dog whistle politics pandering to conservatives is going to get mocked. Bush used to get mocked for the slightest misstep or mention of God.

In this case it is not even religion, Modi as we later discovered clearly said he does not even know Vaastu or believe in it, it is the FUD in the thread that I was questioning.

&gt; Modi ... broke off talks with Pakistan without thinking his steps through, in my opinion. He said tough things about Pakistan but this week he was embarrassedly forced to shake hands with an enemy, Nawaz Sharif, despite his decision on breaking off talks.

What? Shaking hands is the same as engaging in talks? Why is this guy paid?

&gt; Assuming this was a lesson, and many Indians will disagree with this, can he guarantee that the shelling has ended forever? If he cannot, what was the point in not talking to Pakistan instead of working towards cooling things when they become heated?

The lower oil prices is because of US/Europe wanting to have an upper hand in negotiations with Russia and Iran. Once they strike a deal with both countries, prices will start going back up to $100 a barrel. (Only Saudi UAE and Qatar can afford to supply oil at these levels, all the other countries are going to have trouble balancing their budget even at current levels.)

&gt; I really don't see a huge shift in economic and foreign policy with Modi.

Economic it's too early to tell, but given his track record in Gujarat people can make assumptions.

W.r.t foreign policy there's a marked difference. We've taken a much harsher stance vs. Pakistan and china, and have reached out to the US (our relations were stale during the end of UPA's tenure after the high of the civil nuclear deal). 

BJP in general takes a much harder stance in defense, and vs. pakistan that's what's needed at this time. We escalated the border conflict to a degree and refused to do flag meets, which is a small thing but sends a message. Pakistan's foreign policy towards india is often a reflection of it's domestic power struggle and it's always been a problem. I don't think they have the guts to plan a 26/11 under modi, because they view him as a right wing nutjob.

368,"What worked in Gujarat might not work in other states. The thing about foreign relations is that long-term policies are mostly decided by the IFS. The government can choose to nudge it along and explore new opportunities, but very few governments rock the boat.

Most of the ""changes"" are political rhetoric, media propaganda and most importantly geopolitical conditions *around us* that are changing.

Right now it looks like Russia is getting isolated by the West. And yet China is becoming very very pally with them. Russia is reaching out to Pakistan and China, and there's a sort of tripartite relationship emerging. India still has links with Russia, but these have been waning for a very long time.

America sees India as a pawn in their South Asia great game. Now that the Afghanistan war is winding down, their only reason for supporting Pakistan is to prevent nukes falling into islamist hands.

India might be a shithole, but it's an emerging economy with a large consumer base. And America has business interests in India.

&gt;I don't think they have the guts to plan a 26/11 under modi, because they view him as a right wing nutjob. 

Think about it this way. Bush is a republican nutjob (less nutty than the current GOP, but still) - and 9/11 happened during his term. The personal charisma or political leanings of a govt do little to stop terrorism.

For all the ""strong India"" message, we still have Japan essentially ditching India, Pakistan still staging attacks, and Russia-China-Pakistan getting close. It's not Modi's fault, but the BJPs policy hasn't really had  a huge effect on geopolitics.

Agreed. But Modi was the obvious choice for quite some while. Singh's comment came quite late in the day.

If there was a bit more nuance, e.g. ""he's right, but he doesn't need to be so all-or-nothing"", the counter-statement would have been fine. But people were explicitly, this is what the Hindu Right will do when they come to power. That is what the guys on the other side feed on.

They know they spotted a wrong emotion, but intentionally overcompensated. But someone has to do the balancing shit, right? The anti-BJP side overreacted without pre-thought.

Infact there are cases where he has condoned such extremism. His statements such as 'reaction for every action', 'puppy before a car' etc. indicate exactly where his sympathies lie.

So when his ministers make such extremist statements, it does not come as a surprise.

If he does condemn such remarks, it will be only to save his image in public. Make no mistake about where he comes from. He full-heartedly supports the far right ideology being espoused by these ministers.

There would be nothing more dear to them than seeing India become a Hindu Rashtra, where minority Muslims and Christians are subjugated to their Hindu rulers.

&gt;* The 'us' versus' 'them' strategy has reaped rich benefits for the party both in the general elections and state polls that follow making it a favourite with the party.
&gt;* She first said that if the members, ""if anyone is hurt by what I said I express regret and take my words back"" but according to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, she also used the word 'apology' that was however lost amid noisy protests.
&gt;* In August, two months after the BJP's stupendous general elections victory, the Uttar Pradesh unit of BJP decided to kick off their bypoll campaign with a meet where the state chief Laxmikant Bajpai ranted continuously about the Muslim community and how the Samajwadi Party government was trying to promote them.
&gt;* However, when the BJP's campaign was still gathering steam, Modi single-handedly pilloried the Congress and the Gandhi family with sharp, personal attacks though he never had to resort to the crassness of some of his colleagues.

I don't think so, the writer is merely saying why so much umbrage if India is called a Hindu nation when 80% of its population are Hindu when Germany is called a Christian nation.

&gt;Again false equivalence, apart from that Angela Merkel hasn't behaved in the most secular way possible , in these instances. It's called a Christian country because majority is Christian. India is also called a Hindu country AFAIK.

Not true, the moment anybody says India is a Hindu nation, there is spectacular outrage. Even when it is clarified that it is meant culturally there is outrage. 

&gt; Besides being secular implies that you don't attach religiosity to states. Secular states inherently have no religion. But can be distinguished by the major religion they follow.

Very true, but look at the discourse today, if a Modi does puja in Varanasi he is labelled a Hindu fundamentalist. Point is just as Merkel or Cameron who famously wanted Christians to get more evangelical are entitled to their own beliefs, a Modi is. As long as it does not interfere with the functioning of the state.

While I agree with you, it is not how it is currently.

&gt;There are tons of dogmas in hinduism. If you think hinduism is free of dogma, you need to introspect.

A huge difference here, the dogma here is cultural, and not driven by some religious book or a religious authority. Hearsay or Apostasy for instance are religious dogma, even the caste system is cultural baggage - so much so that it has permeated into the Abrahamic faiths also.

 Some of the dogmas that come to mind : Sati, Praying to god, Accepting the vedas as fact, tons and tons of superstitions.

* Sati, wiped out, 
* Praying to god??? How and what is the Dogma here, 
* Accepting the Vedas as fact??? Are you sure you are not confusing Abrahmic faiths with Hinduism? 
* Superstition - Cultural, for instance take something like the number 13, it is a Roman superstition  that has over time seeped into almost every culture, like that most superstitions are pretty much cultural. Take witch hunting for instance, in Medieval Europe it was driven by the Church, in India it is the act of a few retards, no religious book or authority says, ""anybody who does not believe in Hinduism is a witch and needs to be burnt at the stake"".

 &gt;There are tons of other streets with Hindu names far more than names given by British. I couldn't find any source for the Rig veda cited , other than people claiming it as a fact on twitter or other similar sites. No one denies that vedas are a great literary source. People deny to treat vedas as a scientific source. 

No idea about the source, will just take your word for it. However, this person again makes a sound point, we all learn in school that Coppernicus discovered that the sun was at the centre of our solar system. Aryabhata discovered [this, and a lot more](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Aryabhata_I.html) a thousand years prior to Coppernicus.

&gt;&gt; We have looked at the mathematics contained in the Aryabhatiya but this is an astronomy text so we should say a little regarding the astronomy which it contains. Aryabhata gives a systematic treatment of the position of the planets in space. He gave the circumference of the earth as 4 967 yojanas and its diameter as 1 5811/24 yojanas. Since 1 yojana = 5 miles this gives the circumference as 24 835 miles, which is an excellent approximation to the currently accepted value of 24 902 miles. He believed that the apparent rotation of the heavens was due to the axial rotation of the Earth. This is a quite remarkable view of the nature of the solar system which later commentators could not bring themselves to follow and most changed the text to save Aryabhata from what they thought were stupid errors!

Aryabhata gives the radius of the planetary orbits in terms of the radius of the Earth/Sun orbit as essentially their periods of rotation around the Sun. He believes that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight, incredibly he believes that the orbits of the planets are ellipses. He correctly explains the causes of eclipses of the Sun and the Moon. The Indian belief up to that time was that eclipses were caused by a demon called Rahu. His value for the length of the year at 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds is an overestimate since the true value is less than 365 days 6 hours.

I didn't know about this till I did a Google search on round earth 5 mins ago while I knew about Copernicus, and I like to believe I am fairly decently read.

&gt;There were and still are people who can read sanskrit. I am pretty sure that those who are able to read Sanskrit are uneducated.

This is intellectual hubris and actually very close to what the author implies when she talks about the British colonial education system.

Are you saying, education is education only if it is done in English?

&gt;People don't go out belittling poojas and havans.

You then don't know how missionaries operate. There was a self IAMA here recently if you are interested (amongst other stuff available freely on the internet) which would tell you how much missionaries denigrate, abuse and insult Hinduism and its gods.

I think you are not aware of what these acts that you mention really are. They stem from the the Hindu Marriage Act which in itself was a reform of the Hindu relgion and laws and is very secular in nature (as compared to the Sharia governed Islamic civil laws), secondly the HUF is applicable to all Indians except Christians, Jews and Muslims as they have their own law codes, so it is not pandering to a Hindu minority. It has amongst other things far reaching reforms like ""Women are entitled to an equal share in property"", said equality does not apply to Muslim women even today.

It is called Hindu, but does not make it some Hindu pandering law.

&gt;Religious trusts are exempted from payment of tax, the list goes on and on.

Incorrect (or illinformed at any rate), ANY not for profit organisation, from NGO's to Islamic bodies to Hindu bodies are exempt from tax. The Hindu endowment board exercises strict control on the funds received by temples which need to be declared annually, this is exempt for Christians and Muslims. This got so ridiculous that the board has appointed Christians and Muslims to the boards of big temples, including Tirupathi, now this is acceptable if the favour is returned, but can you imagine a Hindu on the board of any big Muslim / Christian religious org? In states like TN it goes a step further, state laws mean some really profitable temples actually come under the direct governance and administration of the state.

The HRCE act allows for the state to control temples, but Churches and Mosques are completely autonomous.
