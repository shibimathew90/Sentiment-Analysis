&gt; * Earlier, Praneeth, who had reached the finals at the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold in January before being laid low by a shoulder injury, continued his rampaging run in the tournament to thrash three-time Korea Masters Grand Prix Gold winner Lee 21-6 21-8 in a lop-sided semifinal match.

&gt; * Praneeth, 24, who had clinched the Canada Open last year, showed excellent footwork near the forecourt and also produced some superb flicks from the baseline to completely outclass Lee, who simply couldn't read the Indian's game.

&gt; * Praneeth then made it 15-5, before reeling off five more points on the trot at 16-8 to seal his final spot.

**Fifth column: Parivartan of the wrong kind** 

 ______ 
India has much more to offer because, luckily, many of our beautiful old monuments survived the depredations of socialist rule, but a measly eight million foreign tourists came last year. India has much more to offer because, luckily, many of our beautiful old monuments survived the depredations of socialist rule, but a measly eight million foreign tourists came last year.

Went to my favourite sushi restaurant for lunch last week and ordered a portion of spicy salmon, a portion of tuna and a glass of white wine. As I sipped my deliciously chilled wine I mulled over the Americans dropping a MOAB (mother of all bombs) on ISIS bases in Afghanistan, until I noticed that the waiter was still hovering. When I asked why, he muttered nervously that perhaps one portion of sushi was sufficient. His reason for hovering became clear. And are we more than 500 metres from a highway, I asked, or should I throw away the wine? Even as we spoke, an old friend wandered up and gave me a hug and kissed me on both cheeks. By now I was as nervous as the waiter and disengaged hastily, whispering to my friend that an anti-Romeo squad might be waiting to pounce.

Saying this filled me with nostalgia for the days before beef bans and liquor bans and morality policing. I remembered Pakistani friends coming across the border and revelling in the ‘freedoms’ of India. It was these they missed most at home. I knew exactly what they meant. Before learning of the un-freedom of Pakistan, I once went to Lahore wearing leather pants and a military jacket. It was January and very cold. When I landed at the airport I noticed people staring and wondered why, until an old Pakistani hand, who had travelled from Delhi on the same flight, said it would be wise to go straight to my hotel and change into a salwar-kameez.

As the first Prime Minister to say tourism could be a vital economic tool, has Narendra Modi noticed that the ugly atmosphere being created by his food and wine inspectors will drive all foreign travellers away? As it is all of India attracts less tourists than Venice does. Even fewer will come if officials lurk in the shadows of bars and restaurants and if couples can be arrested for being affectionate. Surely the Prime Minister understands this?

Surely he has noticed on his foreign tours that tourists avoid going to countries where bars are considered dens of vice and restaurants policed for food wastage? If he has not, then it is time that he did because there is no hope of India expanding its tourist industry otherwise. Tourism was disdained as an economic tool in days of yore because our high-minded Leftist rulers thought of it as something that was much too elitist. Meanwhile, Marxist China invested in tourism and today attracts more than 130 million visitors a year.

India has much more to offer because, luckily, many of our beautiful old monuments survived the depredations of socialist rule, but a measly eight million foreign tourists came last year. Many countries, much poorer than India, are today much richer just from investing in tourism. This investment pays dividends in many ways. It helps preserve old monuments, ancient cities and the environment. It creates jobs in a long list of ancillary industries. And foreign tourists require almost exactly the same infrastructure that Indians desperately need — good roads, reliable electricity and telecommunications, clean water, modern hospitals and environmental preservation.

One of the reasons this column supported Modi was because he seemed to understand well the possibilities of creating millions of jobs through investment in tourism. Another reason was his promise to give us ‘maximum governance and minimum government’. How does deciding portions in restaurants amount to minimum government? Food wastage is a serious problem in India but should the Minister of Food not be concentrating his energies on facilities to store foodgrain and on cold storages that could prevent half our fruit and vegetables from rotting in the fields. On this front the ministry seems to have not moved at all. And the truth is that the Tourism Ministry has been as negligent when it comes to building the right infrastructure. So the end result is neither ‘parivartan’ nor ‘vikas’.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s comrades in Hindutva have been very, very busy. On the edges of Delhi we have in recent days seen Hindutva warriors enter people’s homes and drag lovers out of their bedrooms. Last week, a man got arrested in Meerut for dropping his fiancée home. And, we have seen restaurants and bars along major highways see sales drop by more than 80 per cent since the Supreme Court started imposing its own form of semi-prohibition.

It should not be the business of judges to make policy but they are busy doing this instead of concentrating on much needed improvements in the justice system. Is it not time that the Prime Minister spoke up against this judicial interference? Is it not time the Prime Minister told us what he thinks of the rise and rise of a version of Hindutva that threatens to change India for the worse?

33,"NEW DELHI: The Centre will bear the cost of the promised farm loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh, likely to be the first decision by the BJP government after it assumes charge in the state.

The BJP rode to resounding victory in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections on the promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.

The move was seen hurting state finances with state-owned lenders warning of they being burdened with any waiver.

Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh during a discussion on demands for grants for agriculture in the Lok Sabha said that the cost of the promised farm loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh will be borne by the central exchequer.

Dushyant Chuatala (INLD) said the BJP had promised farm loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh but the Finance Ministry had cited Reserve Bank of India expressing reservation about any such move as it will have negative impact on credit quality in farming.

Reacting to the remark, Singh intervened to say that in some states ""we provide 3 per cent interest subvention and the states provide subvention for the remaining 4 per cent"".

""For Uttar Pradesh, we had said that if we form government in the state, we will waive loans of farmers. The cost would be borne by the central exchequer,"" Singh said in his intervention.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi during electioneering had promised that the first decision of the UP government under BJP rule would be to waive loans of small and marginal farmers.

The Agriculture Minister dismissed Chautala's allegation of ""double standards"" being adopted by the Centre saying ""if some state is providing interest subvention for farmers, that should be appreciated"".

As Chautala sought to corner the government over not waiving farm loan in BJP-ruled states like Haryana and Maharashtra, Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai jumped in to rescue.

He said the loan waiver of farmers in Uttar Pradesh was in the manifesto of the BJP for the state assembly elections.

""It was in state election manifesto. It is not in Lok Sabha poll manifesto ... The state assembly will take it up,"" he said.

In the run up to the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, BJP in its manifesto had promised to waive loans of small and marginal farmers and provide them with zero interest loans.

This was repeated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his election rallies.

The BJP and allies swept 325 seats in the 403-member UP assembly -- the biggest victory in the state by any party in four decades.



Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge too joined the debate on farm loan waiver to say that ""since it is Modi government, Modi should do it for the entire country"".


To this, Thambidurai again retorted, ""Modi is the Prime Minister and not the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. In states where Congress government is in power, how can Centre do it there"".


Chautala said he wants the BJP-ruled Centre to not just focus on one state but waive farm loans all over the country.

The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) had announced a Rs 60,000 crore loan waiver in 2008 for small and marginal farmers.

59,"**Uttar Pradesh, and indeed other states, may issue farm loan waiver bonds to banks but everyone knows these bonds will have no takers. The Centre will have to guarantee them.**

It must leave no one in doubt that the waiver of small farm loans worth Rs 36,000 crore in Uttar Pradesh will create a cascading impact across many other states where farmers, in acute distress from successive droughts, will want similar relief.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who specifically assured farmers of relief during the UP elections, is now turning a bit coy, with finance minister Arun Jaitley starting to distance himself from *the role that the Centre will play in the UP loan waiver.* Jaitley is pretending that the loan waiver is Uttar Pradesh’s business and will not affect the central fisc. He cannot be more wrong. The loan waiver increases the debt to GDP ratio for the state by nearly 3 percentage points, taking it to about 6% of the state GDP. This is likely to happen to many states which are reeling from successive droughts and similar loan waivers will lead to state fiscal deficits going out of whack. In a sense, this is unavoidable and it is futile for the Centre to pretend this is not affecting the overall fiscal deficit – Centre plus States combined.

A loan waiver of this magnitude by a single state has not been seen in recent decades. Immediately after the marathon Cabinet meeting taken by UP chief minister Adityanath, state cabinet minister and spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh told the media in Lucknow that the farm loan waiver burden will be borne entirely by the state government and that the state will issue bonds for an equivalent amount to banks as payment on behalf of the farmers. Later, when asked by a TV anchor whether the massive loan write off would weaken the state finances, the minister nonchalantly retorted, “the state was already bankrupt” so it makes little difference! 

The minister was also at a loss for words when asked why Modi’s promise of waiving the entire loan for small and marginal farmers was not being kept. Currently a loan up to Rs.1 lakh per farmer is being waived. There are about 2.15 crore small farmers with holdings of less than 2 hectares in UP, according to the minister. The total loans taken by these small farmers could be about Rs 80,000 crore. The promise was to waive this entire amount.

Indeed, if all other states follow the same definition of small farmers and waive bank loans, the combined state deficits could expand by up to Rs 3 lakh crore. The point is Prime Minister Narendra Modi has let the genie out of the bottle. Adityanath has taken charge now. It will be difficult to avoid a cascading impact on other states.

**The states may issue farm loan waiver bonds to banks but everyone knows these bonds will have no takers in the market. Private investors will avoid these bonds like the plague. One is not sure how the RBI will look at these bonds because the central bank discourages states borrowing from the market beyond certain, conventionally acceptable limits. For these bonds to become liquid, the Centre will have to guarantee them. These would be like the power sector Uday bonds of over Rs 3 lakh crore which the states have issued to clean up the balance sheets of state electricity boards.**

Issuance of bonds merely postpones the problem and allows the Centre and states to pretend that everything is fine with their fiscal management. Sooner or later this myth will get busted in the eyes of the investors and global rating agencies.

The bigger picture is that Modi has made big promises simultaneously to the poor as well as to the agents if global finance capital who do not necessarily like giveaways to the social sector. For market investors, strict adherence to fiscal discipline leads to better returns on stocks. They don’t mind one time loan write-offs to companies because that helps create positive stock market sentiments. However, loan write off to farmers create negative sentiments in the stock markets. This is why Modi has tried desperately to keep up the the fiction (at least until sometime ago) that his government believed only in empowering the people and not in the grand UPA-type giveaways. Farm loan waiver were largely seen as a UPA disease. However, Modi changed tack during UP elections after seeing the grim reality of the farm economy across the country.

The fact is that farmers are in unprecedented distress across the country. The recent agitation by Tamil Nadu farmers is a case in point. The income promise to farmers –  50% over and above their input costs – made in the BJP manifesto in 2014 seems to have been forgotten. Last week, the Niti Aayog even said that doubling of farm incomes by 2022 is not possible. In a way, Modi’s promises have come to haunt him. He has passed the baton to Adityanath for now, but it will soon return home.

Beijing has mishandled its relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi quite comprehensively, starting from Xi's first trip to India. Modi laid out the red carpet for Xi, sitting on a swing with him in Ahmedabad and everything - only to have to deal with the humiliation of a massive incursion by PLA soldiers while the visit was actually on. 

I remember this. I wondered what kind of message Xi was trying to send with such a blatantly timed provocation. I can't imagine what words were exchanged between Modi and Xi on that visit.

If Patel had become PM, someone else would have had to do the job of keeping the princely states in the union.

And Patel died a few years later, there would have been a leadership vaccuum and we could very well have gone a completely different and undemocratic route or dealt with multi-way split in the Congress.

Nehru wasn't perfect but he provided sufficient stability in the initial years of the country and ensured that the institutions which have sustained our democracy for all these decades could take roots.

Comparing Nehru with Trump/Kejriwal is stupid. Neither of them can think beyond  their own personal ambitions. And Modi has a glorious track record of weakening/destroying any/all democratic institutions/systems of checks and balances that go prevent him from having his way.

**Government’s coal reforms begin to pay off, reduce power costs** 

 ______ 
reforms +

NEW DELHI: Coal sectorinitiated by the Narendra Modi government are beginning to pay. Initiatives to improve coal quality and efficiency in the supply chain have brought down the cost of power from coal-fired plants in spite of revisions in coal prices, central cess and railway freight in the last three years.Decline in the cost of power has accrued mainly from power stations burning less coal to generate each unit of electricity on assured quality of domestic fuel.There is also import substitution worth Rs 23,349 crore, which saves fuel costs.Since cost of coal makes up 54%-60% of the price charged by power producers and is passed on to consumers, coal consumption has a bearing on tariffs and environmental dividend in terms of emissions.According to government data, power stations are now burning 8% less coal than they used to three years ago for each unit of electricity. State-run NTPC , which accounts for 17% of all generation capacity in the country and is the key supplier to states, reduced its coal consumption by 5.5% in 2016-17.NTPC's coal cost stood at Rs 2 per unit in 2014-15 and should have risen by 33 paise due to revisions in coal price, government cess and railway freight. Remarkably though, it stood at Rs 1.94 per unit for 2016-17. In other words, even after paying 33 paise more since 2014-15, NTPC's power costs 6 paise less today.For discoms then, this actually means a saving of 39 paise per unit, taking into account the impact of the revisions, and translates into hundreds of crores of rupees.Lower cost of power ultimately benefits consumers by way of lower tariff. That happens only in an ideal situation. In reality, discoms coping with sagging bottomlines and commercial losses may not be able to reduce monthly bills of consumers immediately. But they will find it hard to justify demand for tariff hike to state regulators. In the long run, however, cheaper power will result in lower traiffs once the discom reforms take root.

&gt;* Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who will meet senior officials of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) soon to review the power scenario, will write to PM Narendra Modi on the issue, it is learnt.Power consumers in the state will have to bear a burden of about Rs 2,750 crore (around 70 paise per unit) this fiscal due to non-utilisation of the fixed quota of power being generated by private sector thermal plants in the state.

&gt;* At the time of setting up such plants, the state entered into agreements with private players that it would pay fixed charges in case its power customers did not utilise the fixed quota of power generated at these plants.

&gt;* In fact, the burden has to be ultimately borne by power consumers in the state.

&gt;* It would take at least one year to set up high voltage direct current back-to-back module at the 400 KV grid, near Amritsar, to synchronise the supply systems of the two countries.

&gt;* The power rates (in Indian currency) in Pakistan at the consumer end is said to be Rs 7-8 per unit.

&gt;* The lynching of Pehlu Khan, a 55-year-old dairy farmer, in the western Indian state of Rajasthan at the beginning of this month attracted a live audience of dozens and a virtual one in the millions.

&gt;* The home minister of Rajasthan, the official in charge of the states law enforcement, went on national television a few hours after Mr. Khan died to make clear where his sympathies lay.

&gt;* It was Mr. Modi who, during his election campaign in 2014, whipped crowds into frenzy over a pink revolution, an alleged conspiracy by his political opponents to promote cow slaughter and beef export.

&gt;* chief ministers across India are now falling over themselves in a quest to outdo one another in showing their love of the Indian cow, which, as Mr. Khans killing demonstrates, is animated partly by a hatred of Muslims.

Highlights 1 Adityanath equates triple talaq with the disrobing of Draupadi.

2 His statement marks the continuation of a pro-Muslim women pitch.

3 Modi govt had on Oct 7 opposed in the SC the triple talaq mode of divorce.

Calling for the end of the Muslim practice of triple talaq, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today equated it with the disrobing of Draupadi in Hindu epic Mahabharata.

""Some people who are silent on the issue of the triple talaq are equally guilty,"" the 44-year-old leader said. He added that the implementation of a common civil code in the country will remove triple talaq.

YOGI ECHOES MODI

Adityanath's statement marks the continuation of a pro-Muslim women pitch the BJP has been raising, using triple talaq as the cornerstone of that outreach. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the BJP would focus on adding new socio-groups into its fold, especially the women and the poor among Muslims.

Dubbing triple talaq a ""bad social practice"", Modi said such things can be ended by social awakening but stressed that the Bharatiya Janata Party didn't want a conflict on this issue.

""As far as social justice is concerned, our Muslim sisters should also get justice. There should not be injustice to them. No one should be exploited,"" Union Minister Nitin Gadkari quoted Modi as saying.

Modi added: ""We should not allow conflict in the society. We don't want any conflict in Muslim society over the issue. We need to end such bad practices by awakening the society.""

Modi's observation came at his concluding remarks of the two-day BJP National Executive meeting in Odisha.

The Narendra Modi government had on October 7 last year opposed in the Supreme Court the triple talaq mode of divorce, 'nikah halala' and the practice of polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on grounds like gender equality and secularism.

THE MUSLIM BOARD STAND

Meanwhile, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) asserted that Muslims have the ""constitutional"" right to follow their personal law and said that those who are using triple talaq recklessly and without justification should be made to face social boycott.

""A code of conduct for talaq is being issued. With its help, the real picture of Sharia directives will be brought out on the talaq issue. If talaq is given without Sharia reasons, those involved will be socially boycotted,"" AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rehmani said on Sunday.

&gt;* Modi had, however, deprecated any attempt at creating a ""conflict"" within the Muslim community on the issue and suggested tackling it through social awareness.

&gt;* AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Wali Rehmani had yesterday said that the board had decided to issue a code of conduct and warned that those who give 'talaq' (divorce) without following the 'Sharia' (Islamic law) will face social boycott.

113,"Firstly, what's with dragging Modi into this as well? You think if this had happened 4 years back, we wouldn't have seen the exact same reaction? That's contrived as hell. Ridiculous. There has been talk of India being an emerging regional/global superpower for the past 15 years. So what?

And this has nothing to do with 'delusions of grandeur'. Most people are well-aware we have a long road ahead of us, and that road isn't going to be an easy one. The point is that some snobbish oblivious asshole is underestimating the economic clout of a country just because a large portion of its population is poor. That's a mistake wrt India... because even 2% of our population is still 24 *MILLION* people. That's a *lot* of people to just dismiss because of their nationality. And a lot of those people have more than enough purchasing power to waste on stupid shit like ridiculous filters for their new iPhones, etc.

Most of the people who are offended at this may not be able to eloquently express exactly *why* they're annoyed by the news, but for you to **automatically assume that it's because they're delusional**, is a pretty fucking sad comment on your own warped view of your countrymen.

**Delhi CM Kejriwal on defensive as Kumar Vishwas video raps AAP govt on corruption** 

 ______ 
Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described as a must-watch and something that “shakes one deeply” a video put out by Aam Aadmi Party colleague Kumar Vishwas, who takes a swipe at the his own government over the issue of corruption.

Still recovering from the humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll where the ruling party lost to the BJP and was pushed to a distant third, Kejriwal stepped in quickly to contain the damage the video could do in the run-up to the April 23 municipal elections, billed as a test of AAP’s popularity.

Reflecting on the state of the nation, Vishwas talks about a host of issues -- from Pakistan, Kashmir to corruption. The video that was put on YouTube two days ago has since been shared widely on social media.

All political parties and their leader should keep India first, says 47-year-old Vishwas, who is also a poet.

“If you form government in Delhi on an anti-corruption plank and fall silent when some of your own come under scanner, people have the right to question you,” he says.

Recently, some AAP leaders have been accused of corruption and nepotism by a panel that looked into a string of decisions taken by the Kejriwal government.

The CBI is examining accusations of money laundering against Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.

In his “India first” message, Vishwas also questions the “personality cult” and goes on to draw a parallel between Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Yogi Adityanath.

“Whether it is Modi, Rahul, Yogi or Kejriwal...it is about five years, 10 years or 25 years. But India is beyond this and will be there for thousands of years,” Vishwas says, triggering talk of infighting in AAP.

Kejriwal tweeted the video on Saturday, saying the video was wonderful and everyone should watch it.

बहुत शानदार विडीओ। अंदर तक हिला देता है। ज़रूर देखें। https://t.co/0pIOm401T9 — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) April 15, 2017

The chief minister then went on to retweet messages of party leaders and volunteers who had shared the video and their interpretation of it.

In an interview to a TV news channel, Kejriwal said Vishwas was family and the controversy over the video message was media propaganda.

“He is not only a party member. He is family...its (talks of Kumar being unhappy) media creation. Tomorrow media will say my wife has targeted me,” Kejriwal said in an interview to CNN News 18, a clip of which was also retweeted by the CM.

Defending his government’s record on corruption, the chief minister said he had been ruthless and had sacked ministers, whenever credible evidence was put forward.

Vishwas is one of the popular faces of AAP and is also on the list of the so-called star campaigners for the municipal elections but has so far stayed away from electioneering.

**Rajnath skips, NDA boycotts felicitation of freedom fighters attended by President in Patna** 

 ______ 
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Monday boycotted Bihar government’s programme to honour freedom fighters, after home minister Rajnath Singh pulled out at the eleventh hour.

President Pranab Mukherjee felicitated some freedom fighters at the event, organised in Patna to mark the 100th year of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha.

The BJP claimed that Singh had pulled out because RJD leader Lalu Prasad, convicted in fodder scam case, had been invited to share the dais with the President at the function.

Former BJP state president Mangal Pandey said that Singh was hurt because the state government was trying to politicise the programme.

“Mahatma Gandhi was against corruption. How can the state government make someone facing serious corruption charges share the dais with the President at such a solemn function,” regional TV news channels, quoted senior BJP leaders as saying.

State BJP president Nityanand Rai told HT, “Neither I nor any NDA constituent is going to attend the function.”

Asked whether the NDA was boycotting the programme, Rai said, “We have authorised Mangal Pandey to brief the media later in the afternoon.”

Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted early in the morning, asking chief minister Nitish Kumar if he was insulting or felicitating freedom fighters by inviting Lalu Prasad, convict in scam, and Rahul (Gandhi) on bail in NH (National Herald) case?

Nitish are you insulting or felicitating freedom fighters by inviting Lalu convict in scam &amp; Rahul on bail in NH case? — Sushil Kumar Modi (@SushilModi) 17 April 2017

HM Rajnath Singh not going to Patna today.Confirmed from HM office. — Sushil Kumar Modi (@SushilModi) 17 April 2017

Sources said that the Union home minister called up Bihar chief minister and spoke to him before calling off his visit.

The BJP reportedly wanted to know why wasn’t its national president Amit Shah invited to the function when leaders of other political parties had been called.

Obliquely referring to the NDA and Union home minister’s absence from the function, chief minister Nitish Kumar said, “We invited everyone (leaders of political parties). I welcome those who have come and have no complaint against those who could not make it to the function.”

His party, the JD(U), however, criticised the BJP for trying to politicise Mahatma Gandhi.

“The BJP has shown disrespect to Mahatma Gandhi by deciding to stay away from the function. I condemn its action,” JD(U) national general secretary KC Tyagi was quoted as saying by TV channels.

Defending the invites extended to Lalu Prasad and Rahul Gandhi, Tyagi said they had been invited in their capacity as leaders of their respective party. “We have also extended invitations to Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha in their capacities as leaders of the Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party. We had also invited Jiten Ram Manjhi as leader of the Hindustan Awam Morcha (Secular) and Dipankar Bhattacharya of the CPI(ML).”

The Bihar government is organising the felicitation programme to mark the 100th year of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha — a non-violent agitation launched to protest the forced cultivation of indigo by the British planters in the then undivided Champaran district of north Bihar. The state will felicitate 254 freedom fighters from 19 states and 561 from different parts of Bihar.

The government had identified another 2,154 freedom fighters, who could not make it to the function on account of ill health. It had instructed district magistrates of respective areas to ensure that welcome kits, comprising khadi bag, Gandhi memento, shawl, charkha (spinning wheel), sticker, white Gandhi topi (cap) and a souvenir were handed over to them before the function began in Patna.

Because BJP's IT cell pretty much mastered the art of using online troll mobs to shutdown debate and attack ""anti-national"" businesses.

125,"Narendra Modi hints at rules for doctors to prescribe generic drugs

---

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday indicated that his government may bring in a legal framework under which doctors will have to prescribe generic medicines, which are cheaper than equivalent branded drugs, to patients.

&gt;* Mr. Modi said his government brought in a health policy after 15 years and capped the prices of medicines and stents, which has angered some pharmaceutical companies.

&gt;* Doctors write prescriptions in such a way that poor people do not understand the handwriting, and he has to buy that medicine from private stores at high prices.

&gt;* He said the government has implemented the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Pariyojna, where people get generic medicines from stores at reasonable rates.

&gt;* Modi also stressed on preventive health care saying if people adopt it, they will not have to visit hospitals.

&gt;
&gt;You can make a caricature and fill whatever you want in its' speech-bubble, but that doesn't mean reality has to conform to that.

Bhakts and Kulcha warriors. 

I don't have to make a caricature and fill in whatever I want because they are already [doing it to themselves](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=india+superpower+meme&amp;rlz=1C1RLNS_en___SG684&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm3Z_nt6vTAhVBN48KHVMTAYUQ_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974#imgrc=tzGvzG_PntDo4M:).

&gt;Wot? Preferential treatment? Ahahaha. You mean the same western media that depicts India as a land of snake-charmers, elephant-wranglers, and aghori-babas?

For every one of those videos, there are like 9 others by NDTV and other political channels from the western media talking how India will take over China in the coming decades etc etc.

&gt;You honestly think that other nations don't do similar stuff to this? What world do you live in, mate? While ""superpower"" might not be their go-to word, given that most of them aren't even Nuclear powers, nor do they have the economic clout that India does, their governments still make outlandish claims and stoke nationalistic sentiments, just like anywhere else.

Not to this extent. Politicians like Jokowi, Duterte and other ASEAN politicians don't talk about how much they have achieved in their ancient past but they focus on corruption and other issues. Whether they succeed or not is another issue but they don't talk like they have their heads in the clouds all the time unlike Indian politicians.

&gt;The Sushruta Samhita is the first recorded text the contain information about cosmetic surgery (not plastic). Unclear what you refer to when talking about space-travel, but astronomy was also highly advanced in ancient India. Nothing wrong with it. Knowing your cultural history is important to being aware of your place in the bigger scheme of things. The dutch are proud of their wooden clogs. How stupid, right? The Japanese, with their long family-trees, and tenuous links to royalty and greatness. The Cambodians seem to love their Hindu/Buddhist lore, and proudly re-enact scenes from the Ramayan during cultural festivals. You wouldn't know of that, right? We should throw away all our ancient past because who cares about that shit? Certainly not a ""progressive Indian"" like yourself.
&gt;
&gt;Well, if you want an idea of what a society without a past they're proud of (or even aware of) looks like, I'd direct your attention to the African Americans of today. They lost all connections to their past, their language, religions, culture, family, everything. They even lost their names. Which is why you see these ""Ghetto-Fabulous"" and ""Ghetto-posh"" names like ""La-quisha"" and ""Shaniqua"". They've got nothing to call their own, so they're building it from scratch. This was the real damage that slavery did to the African Americans. You want us to forget whatever little history we do have left (that invaders didn't burn or pillage) and voluntarily slide into that situation? No thanks.

Again, everyone does it but not to the extent they aren't aware of the reality of what most of India is living in.  

I agree with you about the Cambodia part but not to the extent of constantly touting your heritage in front of East Asian and other non-hindu countries like Japan or Korea when the Buddhists there look to Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet as their spiritual homeland as it makes India looks disingenuous. 

It's ok to remember your history but not to the extend that you start making ridiculous claims in front of everyone else which makes you look insecure.

&gt;More strawman nonsense. I haven't heard a single person on this sub say ""India numba one"" but plenty of them are pissed about the whole Snapchat debacle too. Why is it so easy for you to club them with the ones who think that?

Just because you don't do it or see it happen doesn't mean it isn't happening right now.

There are many of them who are shouting down snapchat on social media sites are those [""India numba one""](http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/snapchat-ceos-fiancee-miranda-kerr-gets-trolled-in-instagram-over-poor-india-controversy-4616443/) types that vote for BJP and Modi and pound their chest non-stop about their ancient history.

It's not gonna change much. Just ask African Americans.

The best way to change perceptions is to keep a low profile, keep your head down and strengthen your economy and military like China.

131,"&gt; The best way to change perceptions is to keep a low profile, keep your head down and strengthen your economy and military like China. 

If you think China keeps/kept a ""low profile"" and kept ""their head down"", you're really the delusional one. You seem to have missed the post about almost exactly the same trend on the Chinese subreddit.

The Chinese 50-cent army is famous, literally *all over the world*. The biggest source of the ""India is a filthy shitty polluted place"" narrative is Chinese blogs, that have been expending an *inordinate* amount of time, money, and energy, into depicting India as a place that has nothing but disease and filth to offer, while China is numba-won!

It's a full-blown PR-war being waged online, and people like you are more than happy to aid their warped narrative, while being dismissive and insulting of Indians who are unhappy about the straight-up distortion and misrepresentation. What's more, you actually buy into *their* propaganda *happily!* while mocking the counter-propaganda like an ""enlightened soul"". Propaganda is only bad when *our side does it*. When others engage in it, we must be silent. Great.

&gt;Even as they make all sorts of nasty comments/predictions/judgement about you, they have no choice but to accept that you've arrived on the world stage. Look at the red carpet treatment that Xi Jinping received around the world compared to Modi as an example.

Hahaha, China is the literal *master* of perception management. Having tight control of your media does wonders for that. Control our media the way China controls theirs, and you're *guaranteed* that India will be viewed as a shining near-first-world nation within the next 12 months. Imagine if Chinese media reported all the rapes in Beijing. Imagine if their media went bananas every time a Chinese man reversed over an accident victim to *finish off the job* rather than deal with the cops. Imagine if they reported on all the corruption and backwards shit that happens away from the limelight in villages and towns far from Shanghai and Beijing.  I say ""imagine"" because you'll never see that in reality. Its easy to progress rapidly when your government is totalitarian. Nobody questions your military budget, or your space budget, or your infrastructure budget. Nobody raises a voice if your farmers get fucked, or your entire population-growth graph is *screwed*, and there's rampant female infanticide, thanks to your one-child policy. Nobody goes weeping about genocide against Uyghurs. 

The same people in India? ""What abt poor ppl! Baniya-raj."" ""OMG genocide!"" ""OMG literally hitler!"" In China, every last one of them would have been silenced to favor that ""arrival on the world stage"". That includes comments like yours, mocking ""bhakts"" and nationalists.

You think Xi got red-carpet treatment because China did something great? Some brilliant move? No. They just didn't waste half their budget on pacifying outraged citizens and pandering to minorities.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi may meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan in June, according to a Pakistani media report. It adds that the meeting would take place even as India and Pakistan are at loggerheads over the death sentence awarded to an Indian citizen and former navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav by the Pakistani military

To authenticate the claim, Pakistan-based The Express Tribune has quoted “diplomatic sources” as saying that “influential” member countries of the SCO want India and Pakistan to “re-engage” so that the next meeting of the organisation can take place in a “conducive” environment.

Other influential members of SCO are Russia, China and some central Asian countries including Kazakhstan. Both India and Pakistan would be formally admitted to the SCO during the 2017 summit in Astana.

According to the report, both India and Pakistan were admitted to the SCO on the condition that the neighboring countries would improve their bilateral ties and work to promote the interests of the SCO.

A screen shot of The Express Tribune report on its website.

About the possibility of Modi-Nawaz meeting, a senior Pakistani official told The Express Tribune: “That’s very much possible.” The official even said that Pakistan did not want to “undermine” the bilateral engagement with New Delhi due to the death sentence to Jadhav.

A Pakistani military court granted death sentence to Jadhav on April 10 for allegedly indulging in “espionage and sabotage” activities against Pakistan. Jadhav’s trial was carried out with utmost secrecy and even the proceedings of the case against Jadhav have not been made public. India claims that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran and framed by the ISI and the country would go to “any extent” to save its “son”.

The tension between India and Pakistan has also escalated in the last few months due to the latter’s apparent involvement in promoting separatism and terrorism in Kashmir.

No such statements about the possible Modi-Sharif meet has come from Indian officials.

The Haryana government on Monday submitted Justice (Retired) SN Dhingra probe panel report to the Supreme Court. The report highlights alleged ‘favouritism’ by erstwhile Bhupinder Singh Hooda led Haryana government in allotment of land to Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and others. The apex court on Wednesday had directed the Manohar Lal Khattar led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to submit report in a sealed cover by April 17, 2017.

The Justice (Retired) SN Dhingra Commission of Inquiry had submitted its report to the Khattar government in August last year. The Haryana Government didn’t make the contents of the report public as it had given an undertaking in the Punjab and Haryana High court not to release the report until directed by the court.

It is learnt that the 182-page report points to the alleged connivance of the Hooda government in favouring Vadra and others.

“I wouldn’t have submitted a 182-page report if there was no irregularity (in grant of land licences in Gurgaon),” justice Dhingra, a former Delhi High Court judge, had said while submitting the report last year.

Robert Vadra, one of the prime accused in the case was seen visiting a temple in Delhi. Addressing the media, Vadra said that he was at the temple for his birthday. He has often termed the inquiry commission as a “political witch-hunt” launched against him by the BJP government in Haryana.

Vadra and others were allegedly granted favours by the Hooda-led state government in issuing licences to develop commercial properties in Gurgaon’s Sector 83.

Vadra came into controversy after he bought a 3.5-acre plot in Gurgaon in 2008 for Rs 7.5 crores and after three months, he sold the same plot to real estate developer DLF for Rs 58 crores.

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had pointed out that Vadra’s firm, Skylight Hospitality, had not submitted documents on financial adequacy, but was still granted a licence.

&gt;* NEW YORK: Controversial Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has won Time magazine's readers' poll of the 100 most influential people in the world, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not garner any votes in the online survey.

&gt;* Duterte, who has made lewd remarks against the US, its former president Barack Obama and several others, received 5 per cent of the total ""yes"" votes in the poll which closed midnight yesterday.

&gt;* Time said since taking office in June, Duterte has waged an aggressive war on drugs that has killed more than 8,000 people in the Philippines and his controversial anti-drug campaign has inspired growing opposition from human rights groups and some political leaders, including Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo.

&gt;* Closely following Duterte in the Time 100 poll were Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Pope Francis, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  all of whom received three per cent of the total ""yes"" votes.

&gt;* Last year, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, tennis star Sania Mirza, actress Priyanka Chopra, Google's India-born CEO Sundar Pichai and founders of Indian e-commerce major Flipkart Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal were among Time's list of the 100 most influential people.

**Philippine President Duterte wins TIME 100 Reader Poll, PM Modi fails to garner any vote** 

 ______ 
NEW YORK: Controversial Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has won Time magazine 's readers' poll of the 100 most influential people in the world, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not garner any votes in the online survey.Duterte had consistently led the Time 100 Reader Poll , an online survey in which the publication had asked its readers to vote for who should be included in this year's Time 100 list of the world's most influential people.Duterte, who has made lewd remarks against the US, its former president Barack Obama and several others, received 5 per cent of the total ""yes"" votes in the poll which closed midnight yesterday.Modi had been named among the probable contenders for the annual list of the most influential people in the world.However Modi had not garnered any ""yes"" votes at the close of the voting, with the polls showing he had got ""zero per cent"" votes along with other contenders such as Microsoft's India-born CEO Satya Nadella , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. Trump garnered 2 per cent votes.Modi had been named among the magazine's probable contenders in last year's Time 100 list also. He was named by Time editors among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015 and Obama had written a profile for him for the magazine.Time said since taking office in June, Duterte has waged an aggressive war on drugs that has killed more than 8,000 people in the Philippines and his controversial anti-drug campaign has inspired growing opposition from human rights groups and some political leaders, including Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo.Closely following Duterte in the Time 100 poll were Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Pope Francis, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- all of whom received three per cent of the total ""yes"" votes.Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had won the readers' poll last year while Russian President Vladimir Putin had won in 2015.Last year, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, tennis star Sania Mirza, actress Priyanka Chopra, Google's India-born CEO Sundar Pichai and founders of Indian e-commerce major Flipkart Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal were among Time's list of the 100 most influential people.

**Old, unfulfilled promises in BJP’s poll agenda for MCD polls** 

 ______ 
Several promises that were made during the last polls but remained unfulfilled, featured in the BJP manifesto for April 23 municipal elections which was released on Sunday.

Some of these include multilevel parking lots, ready-mix concrete roads, CCTV cameras, computer education in schools, regularisation of illegal colonies and segregation of garbage.

Intriguingly, after a controversy over the mention of ‘Kabristan’ (burial ground) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a poll rally during the UP assembly elections in March, the word went missing from the manifesto. In its list of 2012 civic polls promises, the BJP had said that it will develop ‘shamshan aur kabristan’.

Senior BJP leader Satish Upadhyay, who was part of the manifesto drafting committee, said, “There is nothing intentional in it and the party cares for every section of society, irrespective of its faith.”

Some of the initiatives that the BJP-ruled municipal corporations are undertaking already, also find mention in the poll document. It includes online payment for various civic services, unique property identification card, dhalao-free Delhi, door-to-door garbage collection, restrooms for safai karamcharis and measures for cow protection.

In 2012, the BJP had promised to construct 100 multilevel parking lots. However, in the past five years, only three such sites -- at Hauz Khas, Kamla Nagar, Parade Ground and Model Town -- have come up. These, too, remain under-utilised as people prefer surface parking.

The Opposition said the BJP only made tall promises in its ‘sankalp patra’ but failed to provide a roadmap for its implementation.

Delhi Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee said, “Most of the promises are the same from the old manifesto. It seems they were short of ideas and for whatever new they had proposed, they have given no roadmap.”

The first point of the Sankalp Patra’ (charter of commitment) that talks of ‘good governance with transparency’ was featured similarly at the top of 2012 manifesto under transparent and accountable governance.

“It looks a work of copy paste of previous manifesto. BJP has promised betterment of primary education standards to bring them at par with private schools, a promise that was also made in 2012,” said a former councillor.

Upadhyay, however, rebutted the charges and said that it should not be looked as a repetition “as development is an ongoing process”.

To counter the decreasing enrolment and high drop-out rate in the municipal schools, the BJP had listed concrete buildings and computer education in its 2012 manifesto too. However, it failed to deliver the facilities in most of east and north Delhi schools.

&gt;* The RSS-affiliated Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh approached the Supreme Court of India through an application in June for codification of Muslim personal law, especially to end practices such as polygamy and triple talaq, or instantaneous divorce.

&gt;* If the husband gives talaq he must pay mehr (bride-price) to his wife, which is a mandatory payment paid or promised by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage.

&gt;* Though there is no hard data, anecdotal evidence suggests that triple talaq is rare and that in the unfortunate cases where they have occurred, the community by and large has strongly stood by the side of the victim and tried to rehabilitate her.

&gt;* Against this backdrop, the eagerness of the RSS, the BJP and even Prime Minister Modi to project triple talaq as the major issue to be confronted so as to empower the Muslim community is questionable.

&gt;* Instead, they need to focus their concern on the 43 million widowed women belonging to all parts of society, provide them incentives for remarriage and/or programmatic financial support for sustaining a living.

**As President Pranab Mukherjee Honoured Freedom Fighters At Champaran Satyagraha Anniversary, A Boycott By BJP. Here's Why** 

 ______ 
President Pranab Mukherjee was in Patna for an event on Champaran Satyagraha's
100th year.

**Patna: **

For a large ceremony in Patna featuring President Pranab Mukherjee, senior BJP
leaders decided at the last minute that they would not show in because
regional leader Lalu Yadav and Congress boss Rahul Gandhi were to be seated on
the same stage. The occasion was the -year anniversary of the famous
satyagraha or civil disobedience movement that Mahatma Gandhi launched in
Champaran in Bihar against the British.

The opposition said that given that Lalu, as supporters call him, is named in
criminal cases of corruption (he cannot run for office unless his conviction
is over-turned by the Supreme Court), it is inappropriate for him to share top
billing with the President at the event.

""We stayed away because Lalu, who's convicted, was called for this function,""
said BJP leader Mangal Pandey. Home Minister Rajnath Singh cancelled his
appearance for the event, allegedly triggering his party's boycott.

BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said similarly, Rahul Gandhi is being tried for
fraud in a case that alleges his family has misappropriated the vast real
estate assets of a company that published the National Herald, a newspaper now
defunct, that was begun by his grandfather and former Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru.

&gt; Nitish are you insulting or felicitating freedom fighters by inviting Lalu
convict in scam &amp;amp; Rahul on bail in NH case?

&gt;

&gt; Sushil Kumar Modi (@SushilModi) April 17, 2017

Lalu said the BJP's boycott was dripping with irony. ""Those who did not
participate in the freedom struggle and backed Nathuram Godse (Gandhi's
assassin) are now giving lessons in boycotting.""

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was cheery, stating, ""We offer thanks to those who
showed up - and those who didn't."" But this was not the party function but a
government function to felicitate the freedom fighters who have come from all
over the country .

Like Lalu, the Congress is a member of the Chief Minister's coalition
government in Bihar.

**Indian officials to hold talks with US NSA H.R. McMaster today** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: India will be hoping to get some clarity on US President Donald Trump’s policy towards South Asia and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region when US national security adviser (NSA) Herbert Raymond McMaster—the highest ranking official of the administration to visit the South Asian region—holds talks with Indian officials on Tuesday in New Delhi.

McMaster who began his trip to the region with a stop-over in Afghanistan on Sunday, was in Pakistan on Monday where he met Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Islamabad. He was seen as key in developing US military’s counter-insurgency strategy under General David Petraeus while serving as his special assistant when Petraeus commanded US troops in Iraq from 2007 to 2008. McMaster was also deployed in Afghanistan in 2010.

A Pakistani statement after talks between McMaster and Sharif said “the prime minister reaffirmed his commitment to a peaceful neighbourhood and apprised the US NSA of the steps taken by Pakistan to reach out to both India and Afghanistan.”

India and Pakistan are seen as vying for influence in Afghanistan with Islamabad seeking to install a friendly government in Kabul in case of a conflict with India. New Delhi, on the other hand, wants a government in Kabul that will not be inimical to its interests.

So far, the signals for India from Washington vis-a-vis South Asia have been mixed.

President Trump had seemed inclined to act tough on terrorism in the early days of his inauguration—with the White House readout of a conversation Trump had with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January stating that “Trump and Prime Minister Modi resolved that the US and India stand shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism.”

ALSO READ : Pakistan briefs US on ‘plight’ of Kashmiris

But rather than focusing on cross-border terrorism of the kind perpetuated by Pakistan against India, Trump has been seen as keen on targeting groups like the Islamic State (IS) in Syria. Incidentally, McMaster’s visit to Afghanistan came just a day after the US dropped its biggest non-nuclear bomb on Nangarhar province of that country, killing some 100 IS militants.

Earlier this month, India rebuffed a US offer to mediate between India and Pakistan, stressing that New Delhi’s position on and conditions for a bilateral redressal of problems including the Kashmir dispute between the South Asian neighbours had not changed.

India also urged the US and the international community to lean on Pakistan to accept internationally mandated requirements that call for abandoning terrorism as an instrument of state policy. The sharp response came after the US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley overnight indicated that the US would try and “find its place” in efforts to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan.

In Kabul on Sunday, McMaster in an interview to the local Tolonews said “what was critical was strengthening the Afghan security forces and institutions,” besides creating and supporting an Afghan airforce and a zero tolerance approach towards the IS.

On the Taliban, the main insurgent force fighting the US-led troops in Afghanistan, McMaster said the group must be defeated except those who “are willing to join their Afghan brothers and sisters... and end the violence.”

On Pakistan, McMaster said: “We hope that Pakistani leaders will understand that it is in their interest to go after these groups (of terrorists) less selectively than they have in the past and that the best way to pursue their interests in Afghanistan and elsewhere is through diplomacy and not through the use of proxies who engage in violence.”

According to the reading in New Delhi, such statements were in keeping with India’s own thinking about the region, “but we will have to wait and see how the talks on Tuesday proceed,” said a second person familiar with the development.

**In constituency where stone was hurled at him, Kejriwal finds bijli-paani gratitude** 

 ______ 
At Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s event at Tigri on Monday. Amit Mehra At Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s event at Tigri on Monday. Amit Mehra

As Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal returned to Deoli constituency for the first time since the bitter experience of 2014, he received vocal support from locals who said there had been a visible change in the area’s ‘bijli-paani’ situation.

In December 2014, when Kejriwal visited the constituency to address a public rally ahead of Assembly polls, a teenager from the locality had hurled a stone at him. Kejriwal was unhurt and had tweeted wishing the boy well. More than two years later, as Kejriwal went to address the same residents, Tigri village and the neighbouring slum areas came out to give him a patient hearing.

Even though a group of young boys exited the venue after his 25-minute public address raising pro-Modi slogans, older residents of the area backed Kejriwal for “changing their lives”.

“Only the ungrateful will not vote for Kejriwal. Uska paani pee ke kisi aur ko vote kaise daal sakta koi? Two years ago, there was no piped water in my locality. We had to pay for tankers. Today there is regular water supply. Just because he has made water free, some people do not value it and waste it by washing their cars. The government should ensure meters are installed everywhere,” said Rehanna Bano, who lives in a slum near Tigri Extension and had rushed to the venue to catch Kejriwal’s speech after rustling up dinner for her sons. “I missed it by a few minutes. I really wanted to see the man who changed our lives.”

Her neighbour, Eshwari Devi, chimed in, “I also reached late but managed to hear him. Bijli-paani mein itna kaam pehle kabhi nahi hua. Hamari zindagi badal gayi hai. But these days votes are won by throwing cash and not by good work.”

Eshwari’s support came as Kejriwal wrapped up his speech, reiterating his concerns about vulnerability of electronic voting machines (EVMs). “Woh 5 se 7 percent votes idhar udhar kar sakte hain. Itni vote daalna ki EVM ko bhi fail kar de. (They can bungle 5-7 per cent votes. Support us with such a majority that the EVMs cannot be compromised),” Kejriwal said before promising, “Ek saal mein Delhi chamka ke dikha dunga.”

Sticking to the script, Kejriwal ran over the achievements of his two-year government, listing out the difference in power tariff between Delhi and other state capitals.

He pointed out instances of “witch-hunt” of his Cabinet ministers and the alleged non-cooperation of the three municipal bodies over the past two years.

“After I brought down the power tariffs, these powerful owners of power companies, the Ambanis and Adanis, have all gotten after me. They are conspiring with the BJP and I have got to know that if BJP or Congress come to power, they will take away power and water department from Delhi government and make it a part of MCD like it used to be before 1998. Then I will be able to do nothing,” Kejriwal claimed as residents watched him speak from balconies, terraces and out of windows.

“Last year the CBI conducted raids on me. For two days they kept hunting but got nothing except four mufflers,” he said.

Dominated by migrants, mostly from the Scheduled Castes, Deoli has been one of the most water-deficient residential colonies in south Delhi. From less than 10 per cent piped water supply, it has seen a gradual coverage of over 50 per cent of the area over the past year.

Deoli MLA Prakash Jarwal, who lives in Tigri Extension, holds sway over the locals, largely because of his accessibility in the area.

“I live very close to his house and see him around often. He works hard for locals and is very accessible. He has lived up to our expectations,” said Sadhna Bairwa, a resident.

174,"Abandoned Women Outnumber Triple Talaq Victims &amp; Need Modi's Help

---

&gt;* The RSS-affiliated Rashtrawadi Muslim Mahila Sangh approached the Supreme Court of India through an application in June for codification of Muslim personal law, especially to end practices such as polygamy and triple talaq, or instantaneous divorce.

&gt;* If the husband gives talaq he must pay mehr (bride-price) to his wife, which is a mandatory payment paid or promised by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage.

&gt;* Though there is no hard data, anecdotal evidence suggests that triple talaq is rare and that in the unfortunate cases where they have occurred, the community by and large has strongly stood by the side of the victim and tried to rehabilitate her.

&gt;* Against this backdrop, the eagerness of the RSS, the BJP and even Prime Minister Modi to project triple talaq as the major issue to be confronted so as to empower the Muslim community is questionable.

&gt;* Instead, they need to focus their concern on the 43 million widowed women belonging to all parts of society, provide them incentives for remarriage and/or programmatic financial support for sustaining a living.

I don't think he is saying that. He is saying that liberals in their opposition to BJP are 'inadvertently' helping the jihadi elements. 

However if your interpretation is correct and mine wrong, it is would surely be a load of trash. 

&gt;He is arguing that if Kashmir goes away, India would become a Hindu Rashtra. When the cause could be actually opposite. The more India embraces Hindutva, the more possibility of Kashmir going out of India.

It is logical to assume that if India becomes a Hindu Rashtra, the possibility of kashmir going out increases and maybe even some other parts. You are right about it. 

However that does not invalidate the reverse of it i.e. author's assumption. If India yields to Islamists separatists, and let's for arguments sake assume it happens under a congress government sans any Hindutva rhetoric, India would definitely take a firm turn towards Hindutva or even a Hindu Rashtra. How would we explain Pakistan in 1947 and Kashmir going on its way in 2020 (let's say) to our children. Islamism would be an obvious reasoning which they would arrive at. ",2017-04-18 12:44:29

What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included.

---

&gt;* The lynching of Pehlu Khan, a 55-year-old dairy farmer, in the western Indian state of Rajasthan at the beginning of this month attracted a live audience of dozens and a virtual one in the millions.

&gt;* The home minister of Rajasthan, the official in charge of the states law enforcement, went on national television a few hours after Mr. Khan died to make clear where his sympathies lay.

&gt;* It was Mr. Modi who, during his election campaign in 2014, whipped crowds into frenzy over a pink revolution, an alleged conspiracy by his political opponents to promote cow slaughter and beef export.

&gt;* Last month, after a landslide electoral victory in the northeastern state of Uttar Pradesh  where almost a quarter of Indias roughly 170 million Muslims live  he appointed a vicious priest, in full saffron robes, to be the states chief minister.

&gt;* chief ministers across India are now falling over themselves in a quest to outdo one another in showing their love of the Indian cow, which, as Mr. Khans killing demonstrates, is animated partly by a hatred of Muslims.

&gt;* New Delhi: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya who is wanted in India for defaulting on loans worth Rs 9,000 crore has been arrested by the Scotland Yard in London.

&gt;* Soon after reports of the arrest, BJP MP Subramaniam Swamy congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* Mallya has repeatedly refused to appear before courts and investigators in India since he secretly fled to Britain last March, after defaulting on loan payments to state-owned banks and allegedly misusing the funds.

&gt;* Mallya, known for his extravagant lifestyle and who once branded himself the King of Good Times, was sacked in February from the board of United Breweries, the firm through which he once controlled his business empire.

&gt;* He made Kingfisher beer a global brand and ran a now-defunct airline with the same name, besides being the owner of a cricket side and a Formula One team.

**From Bihar To Delhi, Lalu Yadav's Son Tejashwi Yadav Ends Up Owning Land Bought By Others** 

 ______ 
Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu Prasad's son, is accused of acquiring real estate through
proxy firms in Bihar

**Patna: **

Lalu Yadav's son, Tejashwi Yadav, appears to have the sort of good luck for
which most entrepreneurs seek astrological intervention. A series of deals
starting with 2008 - when Lalu was union Railways Minister - have climaxed
with Tejashwi, Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, becoming part owner of
companies that own valuable real estate. It is through one of these that the
27-year-old controls a plot in one of South Delhi's fanciest neighbhourhoods
where ""builder flats"" - a staple of new construction in the capital -are in
development.

Through the last 10 days, Tejashwi Yadav's various land holdings have been
publicised by BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who says that the transactions all
follow the same pattern: a company acquires property, then keeps changing its
directors till Tejashwi and often his siblings or his mother are made owners
of the firm. Not much reading between the lines is needed, the BJP politician
claims, to conclude proxy ownership and illicit gifts of land to the Lalu
family. If this were not the case, he says, Tejashwi Yadav would have clearly
listed the different plots in his record of assets that he is required to
provide as a minister.

Lalu and Tejashwi Yadav both say that was done, including in the case of the
plot in Delhi's Friends Colony. But a scrutiny of the minister's records given
to the Election Commission show that is not correct.

In 2008, a company called AB Export purchased a house there for 5 crores, its
regulatory filings show.

It was a mystery purchase, since the company showed business dealings; it also
did not appear to have any employees on its payroll. Its Memorandum of
Association simply says -""Into import, export and trading of diamonds, gems
and other precious stones.""

The source of funds to purchase the company came from five Mumbai-based
jewellery companies, each of them who deposited roughly a crore each in the
form of convertible debentures: Alka Diamond Industries, Real Gold Trading Co
Pvt Ltd:, Hema Trading Co Pvt Ltd and Yash V Jewels Ltd.

It's unclear why these companies would want to inject such sizeable sums of
money into what seems to be a ""shell"" company. Attempts made to contact them
proved futile.

The directors and the shareholders of AB Export at that time were Ashok Kumar
Banthia and Sangita Banthia.

Over the next three years, the ownership of the company - and of the house -
was transferred to Tejashwi Yadav. His siblings- brother and fellow minister
Tej Pratap and sister Chanda -were made directors and shareholders of the
company.

Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP says these land deals - he has highlighted
similar ones in Bihar - are kickbacks received by Lalu, who, apart from his
term as Railways Minister, was also Chief Minister of Bihar. He is barred from
holding public office after being convicted in a corruption scam.

**Muslim law board shows the door to woman member who opposed triple talaq** 

 ______ 
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has refused to renew the membership of one of its woman members, Rukhsana Nikhat Lari, for opposing pronouncement of triple ‘talaq’ (divorce) in one sitting.

“Yes, the decision was taken at the AIMPLB’s meeting in Kolkata in November last year,” confirmed Zafaryab Jilani, secretary of the Board.

“She was invited to attend the session. But since her three-year term had come to an end, the board did not renew her membership,” Jilani said.

He said the AIMPLB had 101 permanent and around 150 term members, who are elected every three years on the recommendation of the permanent members.

Asked whether all the term members were replaced every three years, Jilani said the decision on renewal of membership and retaining a particular member was the prerogative of the permanent members.

“The board has renewed terms of several members but it is done on a case-to-case basis,” he said.

Rukhsana Nikhat Lari is a former principal of a girls’ degree college in Lucknow.

When contacted, she said she had not received any communication from the Board regarding her termination.

“The board does not send any formal communication to members whose membership comes to an end,” Jilani said.

He, however, noted that prior consent of an individual is taken before being made a term member.

Rukshana Lari first locked horns with the clergy on triple talaq at a seminar in Lucknow in June 2016. She was subsequently not allowed to speak at the press conference after the event.

“If something is wrong, let us admit it and not live in denial simply because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said it is wrong,” she said.

“I am not saying this to please anyone. One has to put the record straight in the light of the Quran,” said Lari, a member of the board since the 1990s.

On April 13, the AIMPLB submitted over 48 million signatures along with a petition to the Law Commission, objecting to a uniform civil code. The board claims that of the 48,347,596 signatures it gathered, more than half (27,356,934) were of women. Lari, however, said she did not sign any document in support of the AIMPLB campaign.

“They know my position on the issue. Probably that is why they do not involve me in such campaigns anymore. Divorce is deemed as the most deplorable thing in Islam. It is to be resorted to only when all attempts at reconciliation fail. The Quran provides three months time for this. Unfortunately, it is being misused now,” she said.

In its strongest ever censure of uttering ‘talaq’ thrice in one go, the AIMPLB, which represents all Muslim sects, issued an eight-point code of conduct to prevent ‘misuse’ of the practice and other Islamic laws (Sharia) in Lucknow on Sunday. But it stopped short of abolishing the utterance of ‘talaq’ thrice in one sitting.

**Government should have sought Vijay Mallya's deportation, not extradition: Congress** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Tuesday said the government should have sought liquor baron Vijay Mallya 's deportation, which would have ensured his being handed over to India, instead of extradition.""Why did the BJP government not move for Mallya's deportation instead of extradition? Deportation would have led to immediate handing over of Mallya to us. Why did they go for extradition? What kind of extradition is this? He was detained for an hour and then granted bail honourably and he is defiant,"" Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters here after Mallya's appearance in a London court.""It took three years for BJP and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to move the UK authorities in February 2017. Why did they delay for three years? Will it take our entire lifetime before Mallya is finally brought back,"" he asked.Mallya, wanted in India for defaulting on bank loans of over Rs 8,000 crore, was arrested in London on Tuesday. Within hours, a court granted him bail.""Relentless campaign by Congress led to temporary detention of Mallya in UK. Strange that he is detained and released in the same go. Mallya's detention is the first of nine steps of extradition with three possible appeals. When will we have his custody,"" Surjewala asked.The Congress also asked the ruling BJP why it helped Mallya get elected as Rajya Sabha member in June 2010 by voting in his favour. ""Why did BJP support such a defaulter?""It also asked why the CBI did not arrest Mallya and attach his properties at the time of registering an FIR in July 2015, which would have prevented his escape. ""Why was he not detained? Why were his assets not confiscated then. Why was he allowed to go,"" Surjewala asked.The party also asked why after demonetisation in November 8 last year did the BJP government grant loan waiver of Rs 1,200 crore for Mallya's bad debts despite the fact that he had fled the country with Rs 9,091 crore.""Why were the Finance Ministry and the banks lax in preventing Mallya from escaping India? Why did the BJP government take three years to make a request for extradition of Mallya only in February 2017 to the UK government for the first time,"" said Surjewala.The Congress also asked why the government was not acting against former IPL chairman Lalit Modi , who too is charged with financial mismanagement and fled to the UK.""Why is the BJP government shying from moving against 'Chotta Modi' - Lalit Modi, who escaped to UK even before Mallya? Will the Prime Minister and Finance Minister tell the nation the date by when India will recover Rs 9,091 crore as also physical custody of Mallya and Lalit Modi,"" said Surjewala.""Modiji should answer these questions instead of hoodwinking the people of the country,"" he said.

**IMF retains its India GDP growth forecast at 7.2% for 2017-18** 

 ______ 
At its biannual World Economic Outlook, IMF increased India’s GDP growth rate estimate for 2016-17 to 6.8%, from 6.6% estimated in January. Photo: Bloomberg

New Delhi: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday called for accelerated economic reforms for India to achieve a higher growth trajectory, while retaining its GDP growth projection of 7.2% for 2017-18.

In its biannual World Economic Outlook (WEO), it increased India’s growth estimate for 2016-17 to 6.8%, from 6.6% estimated in January, while maintaining that economic activity had slowed primarily because of the temporary negative consumption shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions from the currency exchange initiative.

India’s statistics department has estimated economic growth in 2016-17 at 7.2%.

The Narendra Modi government announced withdrawal of high-value currency on 8 November, the full economic impact of which is yet to be thoroughly ascertained.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) earlier this month said India’s economy is set to grow at 7.4% in financial year 2017-18 against 7.1% the previous year, on the back of a pick-up in consumption demand and higher public investment.

IMF’s projection makes India the fastest growing major economy in 2016-17, with China estimated to have grown at 6.7% during 2016. China’s economy is expected to steadily slow down to 6.6% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018 due to the “complex process of rebalancing” by reorienting demand from exports and investment in consumption.

The report said India’s medium-term growth prospects are favourable, with growth expected to rise to about 8% over the medium term due to implementation of key reforms, loosening of supply-side bottlenecks, and appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.

Global growth has been raised marginally to 3.5% in 2017 from the January estimate of 3.4% due to a “long-awaited cyclical recovery in investment, manufacturing and trade” that may take it to 3.8% by 2022, driven by an “acceleration of activity in India resulting from the implementation of important structural reforms, and a successful rebalancing of China’s economy to lower, but still high, trend growth rates.”

The IMF cautioned that inward-looking policies threaten global economic integration and the cooperative global economic order, which have served the world economy, especially emerging market and developing economies, well.

The outlook said India’s economy has grown at a strong pace in recent years owing to the implementation of critical structural reforms, favourable terms of trade, and lower external vulnerabilities.

“Beyond the immediate challenge of replacing currency in circulation following the November 2016 currency exchange initiative, policy actions should focus on reducing labour and product market rigidities to ease firms’ entry and exit, expand the manufacturing base, and gainfully employ the abundant pool of labour,” IMF said.

“Policy actions should also consolidate the disinflation under way since the collapse in commodity prices through agricultural sector reforms and infrastructure enhancements to ease supply bottlenecks; boost financial stability through full recognition of non-performing loans and raising public sector banks’ capital buffers; and secure the public finances through continued reduction of poorly targeted subsidies and structural tax reforms, including implementation of the recently approved nationwide goods and services tax,” it added.

245,"This is indeed very interesting play of political game as can ever be witnessed.

There are 3 possibilities here:

1. OPS is already in the hands of Modi (due to his various mischievous rendezvous twists &amp; trysts with Black Money) and who was forced to come out onto the open as a challenger to Sasikala faction to somehow get BJP a footing in Tamilnadu which has rejected BJP until now. Now that this did not fructify, Modi, based on OPS' inside knowledge, has got the CM EPS to sing his tune as well (through Reddy sand mafia case in which incidentally OPS also is involved). So for a barter of sorts they maybe asked to give out TTV Dinakaran &amp; Sasikala in return for their misdemeanors to not be probed further. As to why Sasikala &amp; Co ouster is required, they know very well of what happened on the inside wrt Jayaalitha's death and as long as Jayalalitha was around BJP getting a foothold in TN was a distant dream and if there was talks of a national level too.

2. The ministers having seen what the Center can do, have come to isolate TTV Dinakaran in return for their party symbol without which they are sitting ducks (with zero chances) as far as the electorate is considered, as the symbol &amp; Jayalalitha was the reason for their very existence. So what powers of the Center did the ministers see? That a case has been registered by Delhi Police against TTV Dinakaran allegedly by a conman Sukesh Chandrasekar, given his colorful biodata, its a wonder that the 'black sheep' of the Election Commission who were to be bribed by the conman have not been made public while TTV Dinakaran has been implicated has given rise to many questions and the powers of the Center.

3. The final possibility is Sasikala calling all the shots sitting from Bangalore! Let's not forget she's learnt how to wield power and command discipline from the men in the party (read goons) from the very best in the business Jayalalitha! There were reports of fallout between TTV Dinakaran &amp; Sasikala yesterday and this drama is being enacted to bring the two factions untied under a different head (Sudhakaran?) This gains credibility from the fact that the newly formed group within Sasikala faction is not saying anything negative about Sasikala even though they are demanding ouster of TTV Dinakaran.


So these 3 possibilities will come out into the fore in the coming days!

NEW DELHI: The Income Tax department is said to have detected over Rs 540 crore black money in the first 15 days of this month. The department started its nationwide operation to check tax evasion on April 1, after the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) scheme ended on March 31.Officials said the tax sleuths, in the first fortnight of the new financial year that began on April 1, have conducted multiple search and survey operations on entry operators (agents using banking channels to launder funds), shell firms, government officials, real estate players and other sectors.As per an official data compiled till April 15, the department has carried out ""over 250 search and survey operations where the taxman raided at least 300 shell firms and detected more than Rs 540 crore of black money.""The action is significant as it comes after the closure of the third black money declaration window of the PMGKY, provided by the government to people holding stash funds to come clean and pay due taxes and penalty, that ended on March 31.The government had brought the first black money declaration window in 2015 for people who held illegal assets abroad followed by the Income Declaration Scheme (IDS) last year where individuals and entities could declare their domestic black funds.The PMGKY was brought by the government in order to check hidden money in the wake of the demonetisation that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 last year.A senior official said three major searches were conducted in Noida near here during the said period against an entry operator who was ""managing"" about 200 shell firms for providing entries of bogus sale and purchase.""More than 20 beneficiaries who have received entries of over Rs 1 crore have been identified and the total undisclosed income in this case is about Rs 300 crore,"" the official said.The official added that a real estate broker in the national capital region, dealing in ""unaccounted cash transactions on sale of property"", was also covered by the department during the said period and tax sleuths have seized documents leading to tax evasion of more than Rs 50 crore.A senior government official of Uttar Pradesh was also searched during the same period after which, the official said, unaccounted cash payments of Rs 2 crore were detected while four hidden immovable properties in the name of the officer's wife were unearthed.I-T department officials also searched an Ahmedabad-based real estate and infrastructure player where tax evasion to the tune of Rs 120 crore has been detected, the official said, adding the investigations in this case are still on as the case involves multiple layers of bogus entities.As part of a similar search in Pune against a business group, the entity surrendered Rs 19 crore income to the department as the black money was generated ""on account of profit not recorded in the books of account.""A Hyderabad-based business group engaged in digital printing was also raided by the department which led to the seizure of over Rs 1 crore cash, the official said.The official added that these actions will continue in the coming days as after the closure of the PMGKY window all those cases where black money and tax evasion has been detected will have to be ""thoroughly"" investigated.

**Modi says govt will bring law to push doctors to prescribe generic medicines** 

 ______ 
The government will make “legal arrangements” to ensure doctors prescribe generic medicines, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, a move that could hurt big drug companies but benefit millions of poor people.

It wasn’t clear if the new proposal would seek to put an end to the use of costlier medicines from Big Pharm. Prescribing a generic medicine means doctors write the composition of the medicine (the salt) and not a brand name.

Modi made the comments during the inauguration of a hospital in Surat, a known diamond hub which is also home to several top Indian generic drug makers.

“We are going to make legal arrangements to ensure that when doctors write prescriptions they write that generic medicines are sufficient and that there is no need for any other medicine,” he said.

“I have seen doctors writing prescriptions in such a way that the poor people don’t understand and go to the medicine shop where costlier medicines are sold.”

Making medicines cheaper is a politically sensitive issue in India where many patented drugs are too costly for most people, and where patented drugs account for under 10% of total drug sales.

Global pharmaceutical firms have struggled to persuade the Indian government to stop more local companies from producing new varieties of cheap generic drugs still on-patent.

India already has schemes that provide free, generic drugs to millions of its poor from state-run hospitals, and some states such as Delhi have made their use mandatory. Many experts question the quality of these copycat versions.

Pitching for affordable healthcare, Modi said his government had forced drugs and medical equipment-makers lower prices.

“Every day I do something in Delhi that makes someone or the other angry with me,” he said, adding he called heart stent-makers and asked them to cut prices.

“I told them those for Rs 40,000 should be given for Rs 6-7000 and a Rs 1.5-lakh stent for Rs 20,000….You can’t imagine how much the drug makers are angry with me.”

Doctors appeared to welcome Modi’s announcement, but some expressed concern over access to these drugs.

“It is a good thing and will benefit patients a lot as they will be getting life-saving drugs at much cheaper rates,” says Dr KK Talwar, former director, PGI Chandigarh and head of cardiology at Max Healthcare.

The Medical Council of India (MCI), the apex body that supervises medical education in the country, has already recommended doctors prescribe generic drugs.

“It is not as if we don’t prescribe generic drugs… but currently accessibility and quality of these drugs is an issue.”

**Eye on Muslim women vote, Narendra Modi gets combative on triple talaq** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was combative, and certainly not defensive, when he spoke at the BJP conclave in Bhubaneswar about a ban on the Islamic marriage practice of triple talaq. He tried to achieve twin objectives: Touch a chord with Muslim women and drill into the head of BJP leaders that they don’t need to be defensive on this issue.

Modi asked BJP leaders to stand by every Muslim woman who fights for her rights and oppose the practice. Under Muslim personal law based on the Sharia, a Muslim man can divorce his wife by pronouncing talaq thrice. Muslim men are also allowed to have four wives.

BJP leaders have been given assignments to hold conferences, travel across the country and resort to other means to spread awareness about Modi government’s position on this centuries-old practice.

The Modi government’s position on triple talaq and the Prime Minister reaffirming that position at the party conclaves serves two purposes for the BJP.

It helps India’s ruling party to reach out to a large section of Muslim women who have been opposing the practice. Largely, Muslims in India vote against the BJP and a section within the ruling party expect Modi’s stand on triple talaq to win over a large section of Muslim women, at least in the future if not immediately.

Also, it helps the BJP drive home a point among Hindus that Modi, as their leader, was trying reform within Muslim community, which has perhaps not allowed equal opportunity and status to its women. Any aggressive posturing on the issue of triple talaq, BJP sources said, will be received well within the party’s core support base.

Gender equality is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and non-negotiable, the Centre told the Supreme Court in October last year while opposing the practices of triple talaq and polygamy in the Muslim community.

This was the first time the Indian government officially took a stand to oppose the contentious custom that has divided the community, with women’s groups and individuals advocating sweeping reforms in Muslim personal law that is tilted against women.

India has separate sets of personal laws for each religion governing marriage, divorce, succession, adoption and maintenance. While Hindu law overhaul began in the 1950s and continues, activists have long argued that Muslim personal law has remained mostly unchanged.

**Punjab CM’s ‘Khalistani’ charge on Canadian minister: In sniping at Sajjan, Captain loses shot at NRI goodwill** 

 ______ 
When Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan announced his first official trip to India two months ago, it reignited a sense of collective pride in Punjab with expectations of a warm welcome for the return of the native. For, Sajjan is the first Punjab-born Sikh to hold the top defence job in a foreign land, and epitomises yet another incredible success story of the Punjabi diaspora. But, Sajjan’s high-profile visit has been met with a cold reception from unexpected quarters — Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.

The visit got embroiled in an unsavoury row even before Sajjan set foot on Indian soil on Monday.

The Captain started it all by dubbing Sajjan a “Khalistani sympathiser”, and refused to meet him during his visit to Punjab later this week. The chief minister’s outburst triggered a chain of reactions, reflecting a sharp divide in opinion on Sajjan’s credentials. While Congress MPs and MLAs were quick to come out in Amarinder’s support, his remarks have not gone down well with other political parties and the Sikh diaspora. Slamming Amarinder’s stand, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex Sikh religious body, announced its plan to honour Sajjan when he pays obeisance at the Harmandar Sahib on April 20.

Sikh fundamentalist groups such as the Damdami Taksal and Dal Khalsa were quick to seize the opportunity, asking the SGPC for permission to honour the visiting dignitary. But, SGPC chief Kirpal Singh Badungar correctly grasped the sensitivity of the matter and rejected the radical fringe’s demand.

While the Canadian authorities called Amarinder’s allegations “incorrect and unfortunate”, Sajjan initially refused to join issue and stuck to the carefully-worded and diplomatically correct script. He chose his own timing and place to clear the air. “I don’t promote the break-up of any country. My job is to promote the bilateral relations,” he said, hours after his arrival in New Delhi.

That, however, is unlikely to mellow the Captain. He has stuck to his guns, citing as “evidence” the fact that Sajjan’s father has long been associated with the World Sikh Organisation (WSO), an overseas body that once espoused and funded the cause of a separate Sikh state.

It’s incredulous that as a seasoned politician as Amarinder, barely five weeks into power, has chosen to rake up the lost cause of Khalistan and used that as a ruse to distance himself from a Punjab-origin top ranking Canadian minister who ironically belongs to his own ilk. Lt Col Sajjan is a decorated war veteran of his adopted country.

In doing so, Amarinder has willy-nilly given publicity oxygen to the long-rejected Khalistani rump.

Personal pique, public posture

More than an ideological stand, the real reason for Amarinder’s snub for Sajjan seemingly stems from his personal pique. He has a bone to pick since last year when the Canadian authorities had put a spanner in his trip to the country before the Punjab assembly elections, on the grounds of legal bar on political canvassing by foreigners. In a sternly-worded letter to the Canadian prime minister, the Captain had blamed the pro-Khalistan lobby for playing spoilsport. Not surprisingly, his charge against the Canadian minister sounds like payback.

In public perception, Amarinder’s stance is not seen in good taste. From Punjab’s standpoint, he may have jettisoned any benefits accruing from the deepening bilateral ties between India and the Justin Trudeau government which has four Sikh ministers — more than the Narendra Modi cabinet. That itself is a significant marker of the sway of the half-a-million-strong Sikh diaspora in the maple country’s power politics.

It is true that the traumatic events of the 1980s continue to resonate among the Sikh diaspora and have come to be inextricably linked to domestic politics in Canada. That explains Ontario province’s extraordinary motion recently, calling the 1984 anti-Sikh violence ‘ genocide’ — a move that India has frowned upon. Yet, only a tiny section of the overseas Sikh constituency still fantasises about Khalistan. A silent majority has long moved away from the separatist mooring, as evident from the rising clout of moderates in the local gurdwara politics.

Ironically, the Captain, in 2005, was the first, and last, Punjab chief minister after Operation Bluestar to have ventured into Canada. Reaching out to the sullen Sikh community, he had audaciously addressed a gathering in a Toronto gurdwara, then in control of hot-headed Khalistanis. A controversy ensued, but he had justified his heart-warming gesture as a bid to win over the alienated Sikhs. In his second stint at the helm of Punjab, Amarinder may have lost an opportunity to reconnect with the NRIs and earn their goodwill.

**Want to embrace Hinduism, says Muslim woman beaten by in-laws, attacked with acid after husband deserts her** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Rehana Raza is among the many Muslim women who have suffered due to triple talaq.

2 She now wants to embrace Hinduism.

3 Her in-laws attacked her with acid after they alleged that their son has given her triple talaq over phone.

Rehana Raza says she wants to give up Islam and embrace Hinduism.

The Uttar Pradesh resident became the latest poster woman of triple talaq after allegedly being divorced over the phone by her husband and then attacked with acid by her in-laws. Now, she told Mail Today, she wants to change her religious stripes from green to saffron.

""Hindu law at least reaffirms the right of consensus a woman should have in marriage and gives a woman a say. That's something Islam lacks, paving the way for triple talaq,"" Rehana said in a telephonic interview.

'DON'T SHOW YOUR FACE TO US'

Thousands of Muslim women from across India have raised their voices against the Sharia law custom that allows men to split up with their wives by saying ""talaq"" thrice. The instant divorce practice has been barred by more than 20 Muslim countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. ""A common law defends numerous Hindu women who need emotional and financial support after getting deserted. I have suffered because of triple talaq, despite my family's revered status in society,"" Rehana said.

A five-judge constitution bench will sit during the Supreme Court's summer vacation in May to examine a batch of petitions challenging Islamic practices such as triple talaq and polygamy after women complained of being divorced on Facebook and WhatsApp. Rehana says she was attacked with acid by her in-laws on April 14 at their house in Neoria town of Pilibhit district. The torture did not surprise the victim, who alleges that her husband started beating her within days of their wedding after the couple moved to the United States in 1999.

""He brought me and my son back to India in 2011 when my mother passed away but he soon left us behind, claiming he had found a job in New Zealand. I had no choice but to turn to my in-laws in Pilibhit who also shunned me,"" Rehana told Mail Today.

'MODI'S ATTACK ON TRIPLE TALAQ IS GENUINE'

Her mother-in-law allegedly asked her to not ""show her face"" because Matlub had already given her triple talaq over phone, which Rehana says never occurred. ""I had approached them after the Allahabad high court order that termed the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional which violates the rights of Muslim women. But instead I have seen days when my son and I have lived without food and electricity,"" said Rehana, who has now been assured support by women and child development minister Maneka Gandhi.

The government told the Supreme Court last year that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and said it does not form a part of the ""essential religious practices"" in Islam. ""Given how Rehana has endured for years at her in-laws' house, Maneka Gandhi has taken up the issue with the superintendent of police in Pilibhit to expedite the case,"" a ministry official told Mail Today.

Rehana's 14-year-old son was not around on April 14 when she claims her brother-in-law Maqbool Hussain, sisters-in-law Parveen and Shakeela started beating her and threw acid on her. Despite her narrow escape after spotting the bottle of acid, she suffered burns on her back and marks on her arms, neck and feet.

Terming the Narendra Modi government's bid to attack triple talaq ""genuine"", Rehana also said, ""Given how our government has vouched for a common law, the hype around triple talaq is important to make people think about the atrocities inflicted on women."" The trauma has not ended for Rehana as she points out that her son has grown quiet over time. ""I insisted for a roof at my in-laws' house but I was thrown out every other day. When we refused to budge, my husband called my teenage son, and told him that we should vacate the house or he would get him jailed,"" alleged Rehana. ""Even now, I am being asked to leave the hospital by the police, who refuse get a warrant otherwise. The harassment has not ended for me.""

**For India’s liberals, party is over** 

 ______ 
A month down the road, the dust — or, given the backdrop, should one say, the cow dust, the godhuli (that beautiful term, resonant with bells, red earth, fading sun, a setting we have now turned into a horrific lynching park) — settles over the announcement of Yogi Adityanath as Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister. But the outrage, by India’s “liberals”, has left a mark. For, with UP’s new CM, it seemed that — yet again — the idea of India had come crashing down. Yet again, Indian pluralism, freedom, even Hinduism, were under attack; majoritarianism (fascism too) waft like cloying hair-oil in the air. These awful times are so fatiguing, we must “conserve our strength”, a liberal guru advises, as we build resistance (a la those WW-II intellectuals); indeed, many of “us” are so overwrought by the “mounting assaults on secularism”, we even forget to tell cook to chill the sorbet.

Of course, given the Yogi’s pre-CM pronouncements, such lamenting is fine. But why didn’t such visceral, gut-wrenching despair dog, say, Rajiv Gandhi, despite his reluctance to battle brutal 1984? Many mouthed Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s “raj dharma” admonition in 2002; but how many asked him, or L.K. Advani, what price raj dharma — also, the strong shielding the weak — in 1992?

Perhaps raj dharma, like communalism, lies in the beholder’s eyes. This suppleness of ideals, this selective sanctimony, is liberal India’s saddest truth, for it reflects how lovingly we nourish the split infinitives of our history: Snobbery, nestled with an inferiority complex. Both show in how fast we overlook, forgive, forget, accept communalism by everyone we’d rather like to party with. “No one parties as much as the Indian upper classes,” Noam Chomsky reportedly said. He could well be thinking of India’s liberals.

Thus, in Indira Gandhi’s era, even as Kashmir and Punjab choked, an invitation to tea, a coterie, a committee, was much sought. A call from Rajiv delighted a liberal heart, although Black Thunder boomed outdoors. Lalu Prasad courting caste was cute. Bihar’s Muslims remained too wretched to even kidnap. But Lalu was such a sweet subaltern, desiring acceptance at Delhi’s clubs. Compared to the right’s charmless determination to bend society to its will, subalterns like Lalu, flaunting the skullcaps, the lungis of street theatre-secularism, were cool.

Such “earthy” leaders made great party stories — or party partners — for India’s Westernised snobs, whose communalism comes with a fake Brit accent. For liberals, when leaders with the right accent evoke communalism, it is, somehow, ok. It is awful when a “vern”, bereft even of Hindi kavita, does so. This explains the puzzle then; how, despite ten years of a non-BJP government, and six years of a non-Modi sarkar before, did communalism grow, unlamented? In 2013, the Ministry of Home Affairs recorded a 30 per cent rise in communal incidents, worst-hit being UP (under the SP) and Bihar (under Nitish Kumar). In 2012, Kokrajhar in Congress-run Assam saw riots displace 79,000 people. In 2011, Congress-run Rajasthan’s Bharatpur shook; in 2010, on Mamata Banerjee’s watch, the Deganga riots broke out.

Yet, as pressures — land, jobs, reservations, passions — began curdling into hate, not one incendiary communal law, not even the beef ban, was sought to be repealed. Not even, when in 2002, five Dalits were lynched in Haryana, on suspicions of cow slaughter. Why didn’t the liberals lament the “idea of India” then? Were we partying that hard with the charming in charge, enjoying high culture’s kebabs, kneaded with power’s grease? Now, when the kebab is literally in danger, we discover, so is the party itself. And we wail.

But not many are impressed. For even as the liberal speaks endlessly about the end of free speech, India has changed. It remains deeply concerned with justice and peace, but it is wise enough to see whose peace is of a piece with a biased view. In this India, citizenship isn’t just ahimsa over foie gras, drinks at the club bar, an exclusive seminar. It is a circus — a website, a theatre, a metro, a mall. Here, as symbols and cymbals clash, even the best faux accents aren’t revered. Here, just because you can say it with elan, you can’t have your communal canape and eat it too. No wonder some of “us” are feeling faint.

281,"The important takeaways here are:  

1. Are generics of good quality?
2. Do they have the same efficacy as the original?
3. Do these generics have verifiable data available for public viewing?
4. Has India had any generic drug maker with a name that is well known and trusted (sorry for my ignorance if there is one)

What Modi is doing is plain wrong. The first step is to educate the customer. Here is placing blame directly at the doctors and indirectly causing mistrust. If you do not trust the doctor then DO NOT TRUST HIS PRESCRIPTION. If however you do trust him, ask him to prescribe generics, and good quality generics at that. Educating the masses is first priority. You can swap a crocin with a paracetamol, but these drugs are over the counter anyway. The real problem lies in getting QUALITY generics for life saving medicines. We as a country have a problem with quality everywhere. Knock the door side of a sub 3 lakh maruti and you instantly know why there is a huge difference in the density of one when compared to a 6L one. Its just a sheet of metal, you may argue, but there is an acceptable gauge to it. As the years went by, we've had quality degrading and the recent NCAP rating of some cars made it clear where we as a country are heading when it comes to quality. 

The law must be to push QUALITY generics, not just any generic and thats where the problem lies. Define quality standards before you start looking for alternatives, otherwise you/loved ones will be the target of lifelong ailments which will cost you much, much more in the long run.

Use your head people, try to figure out that these are populist measures. They have an agenda behind them and THEY ARE AT YOUR EXPENSE, not anyone else.

The Narendra Modi government has taken a major decision to end the VIP culture in India. The government has ordered a ban on red beacons from 1st May, according to the TV reports. The decision was taken at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. According to the reports by Times Now and India Today, only five category officials: Prime Minister, President, Vice-President, Chief Justice of India and the Lok Sabha speaker will be allowed to use the red beacons after the decision is implemented.

Even though the Prime Minister of India will have the privilege to use the red beacon light, according to the reports by India Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided not to use it himself as it will set an example for others. PM Modi had cleared his vision for a transparent government many times and the latest step is a step closer to it.

Earlier, the newly appointed Chief Minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh also abolished the use of red beacons in the state as promised by his party during the election campaign. Last month, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered that no minister in the state will be allowed to use the red beacons atop vehicles. He took this decision one day after swearing-in as the new CM of the state.

You may also want to watch:

Another major decision taken by the cabinet was that it cleared Election Commission’s proposal of buying new Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines. The decision was taken Union Cabinet meeting that took place on Wednesday afternoon after the Election Commission said it desired to use these machines in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The cabinet has so far cleared Rs. 1,009 crore and Rs. 9,200 for the Election Commission to buy new EVM machines but the Commission had sent 11 reminders to the government seeking funds for VVPAT machines.

**World’s most bizarre protest? Now, man in Modi mask whips TN farmers at Jantar Mantar** 

 ______ 
For over a month now, Delhi has been witnessing a bizarre protest at Jantar Mantar. The protesters, who are farmers from Tamil Nadu, have used strategies never heard before — from wearing skulls, eating mice, conducting mock funerals to even stripping at Raisina Hill. Adding to their eyeball popping agitation this week, a man dressed as Prime Minister Narendra Modi flogged the farmers with a whip.

The farmers said the idea was to show Centre’s ‘insensitivity’ to their plights. “By ignoring us, it is like Modi is whipping us and trying to beat us out of Delhi… Sometimes I think if we get arrested it might be better. Jail would be better than this,” said P Ayyakkannu, the state president of the National South-Indian Rivers Linking Farmers’ Association. At the outset, 25 farmers had volunteered to participate in the flogging, but soon after it began 23 of them backed out. One protester even reportedly fainted because of the pain. Prakash, who carried out the flogging wore one of the popular Modi masks and was dressed in the PM’s trademark jacket and kurta.

These farmers have been in Delhi for 37 days now and are in no mood to leave. Their protest is aimed at getting a relief package from the Centre and having their loans waved off as their crops were ruined in a severe drought and a subsequent cyclone. Their loans from cooperative banks have already been written off, under orders of the state government and the Madras High Court. They have also asked for revised drought packages, that would allow them to buy seeds for the next harvest cycle and also compensate their losses.

With he mercury going up in the Capital, the protests have also become more taxing. Ayyakkannu shows us the blisters on his thighs from the heat. “We are sleeping on hot tar while the PM sleeps in an air conditioned room…,” said Palanichamy, a farmer who has been at Jantar Mantar since the beginning of the protests.

The farmers claim that they have not been able to meet the Prime Minister. “This is how they are treating farmers; like slaves,” said Prakash, who used to work in marketing for rice products in Tamil Nadu, before coming over to join the farmers at Jantar Mantar.

The farmers have, though, met many political leaders, including finance minister Arun Jaitley, water resource minister Uma Bharti, home minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. However, Modi seems to be the one they want to meet. “Modiji, Modiji. Jantar Mantar aaoji,” rings across the protest grounds.

Meanwhile, they are not short of bizarre protest ideas yet. The next in line, is a literally ‘deranged’ act where they will try to showcase the impact of their current state. By wearing torn clothes and acting unstable they will depict how they have “lost their minds” in this long battle at Jantar Mantar.

295,"It's a long post so I don't know if you will read it. But anyway. 

Do you know how supreme court judges are [appointed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India#Appointments_and_the_Collegium)?

I'll quote the source.

&gt;As per the Constitution, as held by the court in the Three Judges' Cases - (1982, 1993, 1998), a judge is appointed to the Supreme Court by the President of India on the recommendation of the collegium  — a closed group of the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a prospective appointee.[22] This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed, for the appointments.

&gt;Judges used to be appointed by the President on the advice of the Union Cabinet. After 1993 (the Second Judges' Case), no minister, or even the executive collectively, can suggest any names to the President,[23][24] who ultimately decides on appointing them from a list of names recommended only by the collegium of the judiciary. Simultaneously, as held in that judgment, the executive was given the power to reject a recommended name. However, according to some, the executive has not been diligent in using this power to reject the names of bad candidates recommended by the judiciary.[25][26][27]

So you get issue as hand. 

And if you're aware we live in a democracy. Our democracy has three pillers the Executive, Legislative, and the Judiciary. Each pillar is meant to be a check on other. That's how our democracy works by checks and balances each pillar keeps on other. Now do you realise how serious issue it is if one pillar hacks the system and doesn't let other pillar i.e. executive and legislature check it.? That's what supreme court did by giving only itself power in appointing the judges. 

And modi government tried to change that by passing law of NJAC. In this system a committee a committee of 5 people was to be formed in which 3 people are from judicary, law minister and one prominent public figure to be appointed by president in colsultation with CJI. So MODI government was ready to give 4 our 5 votes to judicary in regard to appoinment of Judges. But court didn't agree on it. I wanted all five.

So how can you say 

&gt;Modi has been delaying judicial appointments, **as some allege**, **to get judges of his choice.

Who are these some who allege? AAPtards like you who are blindly fighting for fake EMVs because your supreme leader said it? Are we to take allegations as a source/proof in an argument now?

And does

&gt;The government tried the NJAC and other means but I think it is fair that the judiciary and appointments are kept beyond the hands of the government. considering that there is a protest petition filed against modi in the 2002 cases, there is also a serious conflict of interest in allowing modi to control judicial appointments.

this even apply if 4 out of 5 votes in NJAC are with judiciary?

For further information read some intellectual [sources](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/collegium-system-supreme-court-how-judges-are-appointed-and-transferred-the-debate-around-it-4375719/) which will teach you something.

 ______ 
No beacons (_lal batti_) for central government officers from May 1, say
sources

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not use beacons or

_lal batti_

on his cars anymore and neither will other ministers. From May 1, officials,
ministers, chief ministers and judges are banned from using the red flashing
lights on their cars. Only emergency vehicles will be allowed to use beacons,
Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said today, removing the

_lal batti_

from his own car.

Mr Gadkari made the announcement after a cabinet meeting today and said this
was done to check ""VIP culture"".

In recent meetings, the Prime Minister had reportedly been emphatic about
ending '

_lal batti_

culture' that has come to symbolize VIP arrogance at the cost of public
convenience.

Two newly elected chief ministers - Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh and
Amarinder Singh in Punjab - had already given up use of beacons on their
official cars.

Recently, PM Modi's convoy went to the Delhi airport to receive Bangladesh
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""in normal traffic"", which means no traffic
restrictions were in place throughout the route.

Usually, policemen put up barricades and block every route that dignitaries
are to take, leaving people waiting interminably for the roads to open. The
video of an ambulance carrying a wounded child being blocked by policemen in
Delhi earlier this month went viral online.

In 2013, a court order said the use of beacons should be restricted and only
constitutional authorities should be allowed to use it.

The PM reportedly called a meeting last week to discuss how to pare down the
use of beacons.

Red beacon banned: The Union Cabinet took the decision to do away with this VVIP culture at a meeting Wednesday morning Red beacon banned: The Union Cabinet took the decision to do away with this VVIP culture at a meeting Wednesday morning

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday decided to do away with red beacons atop officials cars, announcing that only three categories would be allowed to use it – the President, Vice President and Chief Justice of India. The decision comes into effect from May 1, 2017. “Red beacon to be removed from cars of PM and all ministers. It will be allowed only on emergency service vehicles from May 1 to end VIP culture,” Union Minister Gadkari told news agency PTI.

Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said: “A red light can be carried in vehicles of high dignitaries specified by the Central and State government. Now, neither in state or centre the government will be able to nominate any members to use the red beacon. There are no exceptions,” Jaitley said. Fire brigade, ambulance services, police vehicles and other emergency services will be allowed to use the blue beacon, Jaitley added.

In effect, the ban applies to the prime minister, union ministers, chief ministers, state cabinet ministers, bureaucrats and judges of the High Court and Supreme Court.

The move comes weeks after the two chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab decided against the use of the red beacon or lal batti on their official cars.

In December 2013, a bench of Justices GS Singhvi and C Nagappan directed States to amend the Motor Vehicle Rules to restrict the use of the red beacon and impose an exemplary fine on those who misused it. The court order said only constitutional authorities would be allowed to use the red beacon.

**Farm loan write-offs win votes in India, but may hurt economy**

Mumbai/New Delhi: India risks straining public finances and undermining already ailing state banks, economists said, after a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers in Uttar Pradesh and moves to do something similar in at least four other states.

One of the first acts of the new government in India’s most populous state following last month’s election triumph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was to keep a promise to provide debt relief to 21.5 million farmers.

Taking their cue from Uttar Pradesh, more state governments could waive loans to farmers, senior officials there said, to fulfil election pledges or woo rural voters before further polls in the run-up to a general election in 2019 when Modi is expected to run for a second term.

“This will spread like a contagious disease to most parts of the country and you will very soon see at least 3-4 states announcing similar farm loan waivers,” said Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised India’s last government.

Economists caution that the move could encourage indebted farmers not to repay loans, deepening malaise at public sector banks already saddled with most of India’s $150 billion in stressed loans.

Also Read: Loan waiver is not the solution to farm crisis

Uttar Pradesh will cover the cost of the waivers by issuing bonds. This would in turn constrain India’s sovereign credit because such bonds are backstopped by the federal government, the economists said.

India’s total public sector debt, as a share of gross domestic product, stands at around 66 percent - high compared to other emerging economies.

Economists at Merrill Lynch estimate that states will end up writing off debts equivalent to 2% of GDP — the bulk of all outstanding loans to farmers.

Leverage levels

Ratings agencies would like to see India’s debt-to-GDP ratio fall below 60% over the next three years to justify an upgrade in its sovereign rating. Yet debt waivers would, even if staggered, force up borrowing, analysts said.

“The loan waivers would likely worsen the fiscal deficits and leverage levels of the state governments, unless other resources are mobilised or expenditure is controlled,” said Aditi Nayar of ICRA, an affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service.

“There is a significant risk that productive capital spending may end up being reduced to fund a portion of the loan waivers.”

A government-appointed panel has suggested capping the states’ debt at 20% of India’s GDP, while Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has said the Uttar Pradesh loan waiver “undermines honest credit culture”.

Who’s next?

Maharashtra and Punjab are expected to announce similar loan waivers soon, senior officials in both states told Reuters.

In Maharashtra, ruled by the BJP, farmers are clamouring for a bailout after two years of drought and falling commodity prices. In Punjab, known as India’s grain bowl, the opposition Congress party won last month’s election partly on the promise of a farm loan waiver.

In Tamil Nadu, reeling from dry weather, a court asked the state government to write off loans to all farmers.

Farmers from Tamil Nadu recently protested in New Delhi, showing the skulls of neighbours who had committed suicide to press their demand for drought relief and loan write-offs.

Won’t pay

Some of India’s 263 million farmers have decided not to repay their debts, expecting loan waivers to mean they don’t have to.

“I am not going to repay the loan because defaulters benefited from the previous waiver and I didn’t get any government help even as I repaid the loan on time,” said Gorakh Patil, a farmer from Jalgaon in western India.

Patil was referring to an $11 billion national farm loan waiver in 2008 that helped the Congress party-led coalition of the day win re-election the following year. But non-performing assets jumped.

Gross non-performing loans in agriculture and its allied sectors surged to Rs58,800 crore ($9.12 billion) at the end of the December quarter, from Rs9,740 crore in the 2007/08 fiscal year, RBI data show.

“There’s no benefit from such waivers,” said a director at one state bank who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “If you give any benefit across the board, it definitely has an adverse effect on credit discipline.” Reuters

**PM Narendra Modi to shun red beacon in government's big crackdown on VVIP culture** 

 ______ 
Highlights Cabinet takes decision to shun red beacons.

Only five categories of people will be allowed to use the red flashing lights.

PM Modi to himself give up the red beacon, sources say.

The Centre today took a decision against using red beacons. The decision, likely to be implemented from May 1, was cleared by the cabinet today and would impact Union minsters and top bureaucrats.

According to sources, only five categories of people will be allowed to use red beacons: the President of India, the Vice President, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Lok Sabha speaker.

While the prime minister would be allowed to use red beacons, sources tell India Today that PM Narendra Modi will himself give up the privilege to use it.

Announcing the move today afternoon, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the decision was taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that the Motor Vehicles Act is being amended to implement the new rule.

Following the amendment, which will be effective from May 1, no official, whether from the Centre or a state, will be able to use red beacons, Jaitley said.

Vehicles of emergency services such as fire bridage, police and hospitals will be expempted from the new rule and will be allowed to use blue beacons.

Commenting on the decision, Union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari said that beacons would be allowed only on emergency vehicles. Gadkari also said he would not be using a 'laal batti' on his vehicles.

Recently, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had instituted a similar ban on red and blue beacons in the state.

The new Congress government in the state has announced that using red or any type of beacon in Punjab will be criminal offense , but hasn't clarified whether judges of the state courts will be required to follow the new directive.

The Bharatiya Janata Party's Yogi Adityanath, who completed a month as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister today, has also warned his ministers and bureacrats not to misuse red beacons. ""

I acknowledge that the MLAs and ministers of the state are in charge of a huge population of Uttar Pradesh and thus entitled to a few privileges but they are to use these privileges with caution,"" he had said in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.

**VIP culture of beacon lights to end from May 1: Nitin Gadkari**

Seeking to end VIP culture, the Union Cabinet today decided that beacon light will be removed from all vehicles, including that of the Prime Minister, from May 1. “In a historic decision, the Cabinet has decided that beacon lights will be removed from all vehicles, barring emergency service vehicles, from May 1,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari told PTI.

Gadkari showed the way by becoming the first minister to take the beacon off his official vehicle after the Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has been decided to do away with beacons of all kinds on top of all categories of vehicles in the country.

The minister said “this government is a government of common masses and has decided to abolish VIP culture of beacon lights and sirens”. The government has taken the decision with a view to strengthening “healthy democratic values” in the country.

“The government is of the considered opinion that beacons on vehicles are perceived symbols of VIP culture and have no place in a democratic country. They have no relevance whatsoever,” Gadkari reasoned.

Beacons, however, will be allowed on vehicles concerning emergency and relief services, ambulance, fire service etc. In light of the decision, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will make necessary provisions in law.

According to Gadkari, this is start of a healthy culture and tradition as blaring of sirens and blazing of beacons used to anger the masses. In many states, even MLAs blatantly used beacon lights, he said, adding that some of them had the practice of using detachable beacons. Even use of sirens by ministers is not legal as these can be used only by pilot police vehicles, he pointed out.

The step is bound to increase faith and respect of common masses in the Narendra Modi government, he hoped. Asked what will be the punitive measures in case of violations, the minister said action will be taken as per provisions.

He said a detailed notification in this regard will be issued soon and there is no need for any amendment in the Motor Vehicles Act. “We can issue the notification under respective rules and before that, a notice will be issued for public hearing,” he said.

&gt; That being said, you were implying that this is a global conspiracy, with India as the experimental concept stage. 

From my [previous link](https://www.usaid.gov/india/press-releases/jan-20-2016-beyond-cash-identifies-barriers-and-solutions-digital-inclusive-economy-india) a few comments ago, the US is the global 'decider' for the global future. That link clearly showed the US was involved in India's push for a cashless society. Read their '[who we are](https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are)' and decide (given the US's history of fucking over multiple countries) if *this time*, it's a purely self serving or utopian dream for India they are pushing for.

&gt; India has far too many issues, compared to say Belgium or Switzerland.

India does, but most European countries dislike/hate the American govt, so are less likely to toe the US line unless forced (see [banking/tax rules](http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/us-and-switzerland-agree-to-new-tax-treaty/676988) - the Swiss didn't do this because they wanted to...) - Modi, seems to have rolled over asking for a US belly rub.

Sushma and Jaitley fell into line. These are anyway not mass leaders (no state or electorate backing). To weaken Jaitley even more they made him contest against Amrinder in Punjab for the national election. A state where Jaitley has never done anything, Vs a very strong well respected leader - in fact Jaitley had never contested direct election since 1980! Guess what? Jaitley as expected lost by over 90,000 votes (and was shown his place). They could have given him a safer seat, but this was done to make him rely on team Modi to get to the parliament. Which they did, but giving him a Rajya Sabha seat (from Gujarat, heh). Then he was given a minister's portfolio. A very weakened minister who could not even get elected and depends on the PM (and PM's state) for his very parliamentary seat.

And btw Singh earlier gave up the symbolic red beacon light on his vehicle, fulfilling a promise the Congress made in its election manifesto. His cabinet ministers followed his example. 

I feel prohibiting the inscription of names of government functionaries on foundation stones and inaugural plaques and dedicating it to the People of Punjab is more noteworthy and reminds those in Power that they are merely instruments of a functioning Democracy!

Hope Modi follows Amarinder Singh's footsteps in this as well!",2017-04-19 19:27:34
328,"&gt;[VVPAT device functions like a printer attached to the ballot unit and kept inside the voting compartment. When the voter presses the button against the name of the candidate of her/his choice on the EVM unit, the VVPAT unit generates a paper slip, also called ‘ballot slip’. This paper slip contains the name, serial number, and symbol of the chosen candidate. The voter can see this slip through a screened window where it stays for seven seconds and then it automatically gets cut and falls into a sealed drop box. Thus, the ballot slip neither goes into the hands of the voter nor others get to see it.

Want to buy a stake in an aircraft-carrier builder? How about a fighter-jet maker?India is about to start an $11 billion sale of government assets, including holdings in the shipyard and factories that supply India’s military , offering investors a share of some of the region’s more profitable manufacturers that are benefiting from soaring defence spending.India is the world’s largest arms importer and Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to change that while at the same time raising money to reduce the fiscal deficit. Among the biggest stakes to be sold are in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., or HAL , which is trying to build a domestic fighter, and Cochin Shipyard Ltd ., currently building India’s first home-made aircraft carrier. The shipbuilder has seen profit almost double in the last five years, while earnings at most big global shipyards have slumped.As India builds its status in the region, “it will find it even more essential that it becomes self-sufficient in designing and manufacturing high-tech weapon systems,"" said Deepak Sinha, a consultant with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. Non-state investors can help make the arms-makers more efficient and focused, he said.Modi has pledged to spend $250 billion by 2025 on weapons and military equipment for a nation that has territorial disputes with Pakistan and China. India makes about 70 percent of its defence purchases abroad and has topped the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s list of the largest defence importers for the last seven years.Economic growth in Asia in the past decade is spurring countries like India, China and Indonesia to upgrade their armed forces in the face of geopolitical tensions. That’s pushed Asia-Pacific to the forefront of the growth in defence spending. The region’s military outlay rose 5.4 percent to around $436 billion in 2015, compared with a 1.7 percent increase in Europe and a drop across Africa and the Americas, according to SIPRI, although spending, as a percentage of GDP, has been in line with economic growth in these countries.India is also asking private equity funds to invest in profitable state-controlled companies such as helicopter maker Pawan Hans Ltd. and BEML Ltd., which makes military and mining vehicles and rail cars.Modi’s administration has budgeted for a 35 percent increase in earnings from asset sales in the current year, taking advantage of a stock market that just had its best three months since 2014. Modi has pledged to shrink Asia’s widest budget deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP in the year starting this month, from an estimated 3.5 percent.""The timing seems good as the market has started making new highs,"" said Deepak Mohoni, founder of market strategy firm Trendwatch India Pvt., who coined the term ""Sensex"" for the Mumbai stock exchange index. ""Funds will pick them up.""India has met or beaten its so-called annual disinvestment target only five times since 1998.India has traditionally relied on Russian weapons, with Sukhoi and MiG fighters forming the backbone of its air strike capability. It has recently moved towards buying defence equipment from the U.S. HAL has been developing the Tejas home-made fighter jet for more than three decades, but it has yet to produce a version that plays a major role in the air force.The aircraft carrier that Cochin Shipyard is building for the Indian Navy forms a ""significant part"" of the company’s current order book, according to regulatory filings. The nation’s only existing carrier in service is a former Soviet vessel that was decommissioned by the Russians in 1996 and refitted for India a decade later.Cochin Shipyard filed regulatory papers for an IPO last month. HAL would be ready by July or August, according to Chairman T Suvarna Raju. Finance Ministry spokesman D.S. Malik declined to comment.India opened its defence manufacturing to private companies 15 years ago, but a lack of infrastructure for niche military manufacturing and a government preference for imported products mean the sector effectively remains a monopoly of state-run firms. Modi raised the cap on foreign ownership of defence contractors to 49 percent, from 26 percent, after he took power in 2014 with special dispensation for full ownership if the deal would bring India advanced military technology.""It’s long been the aim of successive Indian governments to raise a self-sufficient, globally competitive indigenous defence industry,"" said Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The increased cap on foreign stakes in private Indian defence firms should help bring the private and state-run Indian firms and foreign technology closer together, he said.The Indian government aims to raise another 470 billion rupees selling stakes in companies in the year ending March 2019, and 400 billion rupees the following year.

Jaitley wasn't pushed to fight Amrinder. He was given the safe seat of Amritsar by ousting Siddhu. Amrinder wasn't even suppose to run for LokSabha election and got his wife to run from another seat. However after the announcement of Jaitley's candidature Congress sprung a surprise and forced unwilling Amrinder to run from Amritsar against Jaitley. But jaitley wasn't a match for even an unwilling Amrinder, in a modi wave.

&gt; “Modi rules by fear,” he said, “and Jaitley by favour.”

&gt; “Jaitley is the quintessential networker in Delhi, so he would take care of Modi like he would take care of a raft of people. But nobody else did that to Modi and nobody took him seriously at that time.” Many journalists and BJP leaders remember Modi as a regular visitor to Jaitley’s house in south Delhi.

&gt; Advani wrote about both Modi and Jaitley as protégés in his autobiography, though he reserved his highest praise for Pramod Mahajan, whose dominance undercut the competition between the others. 

&gt; Vajpayee planned to sack Modi from the BJP, and Jaitley, following Advani’s instructions, played a strategic role on behalf of the party’s hardliners. By the time the next Gujarat assembly elections were held in December, Jaitley was, as Rediff.com reported, Modi’s “tireless defender.”

So till now even Advani supported Modi. Crab mentality steps in when they fear their ambitions thwarted. 


&gt; He quoted an unnamed BJP leader who argued that Jaitley was only supporting Modi in the secret hope “that after the elections he will not get the support needed to form the government,” after which Jaitley “the man closest to Narendra Modi,” would “step forward as the secular choice” for prime minister, as Vajpayee had once done. 

&gt; “The BJP insiders those days told me Arun Jaitley was egging Nitish Kumar on,” Kishwar told me, in Kumar’s campaign against Modi, “because he didn’t want Modi to be stigma-free.” 

&gt; Jethmalani, in an interview to the Economic Times, observed that Modi “keeps his enemies closer,” referring to both Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, who had openly opposed Modi’s candidacy but was still given the external affairs portfolio. 

&gt; When it comes to the finance ministry, Modi appears to be keeping Jaitley on a shorter leash, and steadily placing men loyal to himself in its offices. Hasmukh Adhia, who was Modi’s principal secretary in Gujarat, was made the secretary of the department of financial services last November. GC Murmu, a Gujarat bureaucrat who handled riot-related cases for Modi when he was chief minister, and Raj Kumar, another Gujarat-cadre officer, were appointed joint secretaries in the department of expenditure and the department of economic affairs respectively. A senior journalist based in Gujarat described their absolute loyalty to Modi, and told me that “Murmu, in likelihood, will be made the director of Enforcement Directorate after he is empanelled Additional Secretary,” pointing out that “Modi has kept that post vacant for a while now.”

It is a 'friendship' of convenience, as Vinod Mehta put.

PM Narendra Modi on _lal batti_ ban said, ""Every Indian is special. Every
Indian is a VIP.""

**New Delhi: **

Every Indian is a VIP and the culture of beacon should have gone long ago,
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said tonight, hours after deciding to bar their
use by the VVIPs, including the President, the Prime Minister and the Chief
Ministers.

""..These symbols are out of touch with the spirit of new India,"" PM Modi said.

He was responding to a tweet by a follower, who described the decision to
prohibit all vehicles, except emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire
brigade, from using the beacon lights from May 1, as ""historic"".

Vehicles with beacon lights, which are seen as a symbol of VIP culture, ""have
no place in a democratic country"", the government said after the decision was
taken at a Cabinet meeting.

""It should have gone long ago. Glad that today a strong beginning has been
made,"" Prime Minister said in response to another tweet.

""Every Indian is special. Every Indian is a VIP,"" he added.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while briefing the media about the Cabinet
decisions, said the matter was under discussion for some time and ""the Prime
Minister took the decision and informed the Cabinet.""

He said amendments will be made soon in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules to
give effect to the decision.

""After May 1, no one will be able to put red light atop his/her vehicle. Blue
light will be used only for emergency vehicles in the country...Neither the
states nor the Centre will have power to give any special permission (for use
of beacon lights),"" Mr Jaitley said.

&gt;* And on this blighted occasion, he was one of only five-ten people in the village who regularly travelled to the Jaipur fair, to buy cattle at modest prices and sell them locally, earning a few thousand each time as premium.

&gt;* At 55, Pehlu wanted his sons to learn the cattle trade, so Irshad (24) and Arif (19) had accompanied him, along with two others from the village  Rafiq and Azmat.

&gt;* This time there was an additional lure for all of them  the coming month of Ramzan, for which they wanted good animals capable of giving milk and providing curd, so essential for the pre-dawn Sehri ritual.

**ISRO to launch South Asia Satellite on May 5** 

 ______ 
The launch of this communication satellite (GSAT-9) is scheduled for May 5 on board the space agency’s rocket GSLV-09 from Sriharikota spaceport. (Source: ISRO) The launch of this communication satellite (GSAT-9) is scheduled for May 5 on board the space agency’s rocket GSLV-09 from Sriharikota spaceport. (Source: ISRO)

India plans to launch on May 5 the ‘South Asia Satellite’ that will benefit all the countries in the region, except Pakistan which is not a part of the project. “It’s going up in the first week of May,” Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman A S Kiran Kumar told PTI in a telephonic interview.

According to ISRO sources, the launch of this communication satellite (GSAT-9) is scheduled for May 5 on board the space agency’s rocket GSLV-09 from Sriharikota spaceport. Kiran Kumar said the satellite, with a lift-off mass of 2,195 kg, would carry 12 ku-band transponders. “Pakistan is not included in that. They did not want (to be part of the project),” he said. Sources said the satellite is designed for a mission life of more than 12 years.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made an announcement about this satellite during the SAARC Summit in Kathmandu in 2014 calling it a “gift to India’s neighbours.””It (name) was changed to this (South Asia Satellite) because of that only (Pakistan not being part of it),” Kiran Kumar said. Earlier, it was named as ‘SAARC Satellite.’

“Basically, it (the satellite) is meant for providing communication and disaster support, connectivity among States (countries of South Asia region). It will provide a significant capability to each of these participating States in terms of DTH, certain VSAT capacity plus linking among the states for both disaster information transfer and also in terms of library type of things,” he said.

“So, there is a significant amount of inter-linking possible among the States (these countries),” Kiran Kumar said.According to ISRO officials, there is a potential for each participating country to use a dedicated transponder with a capacity of 36 to 54 Mhz for its own internal use. Each country would be responsible for content generation and its use, they said.

360,"&gt; Like every new PM he fell into the trap of pakistan.

If he had not made even an attempt I am sure ""Indian Liberals"" would be claiming that all the problems would have been solved if he had just made an effort. That the honorable, peace loving nation of Pakistan would certainly agree to talks and would not have to *resort* to stir Kashmir if only the Muslim hating hardliner Hindutva bigot would agree to give peace a chance!

What exactly would you suggest he should have done? One thing people are forgetting is that due to America's stupidity in Afghanistan, Pakistan has managed to secure its western flanks. The Western nations are desperate to get out of there and the Jihad there is winding down. The time to pin Pakistan down and hold it to its promises was in 2002 to 2012. It was inevitable that Pakistan would eventually turn its attention and proxies to Kashmir. 

Besides, I don't see what Modi could have done. I mean we had a liberal government filled with some of the most highly educated people in power for 10 years when there was a lot of peace in the valley since at least 2002-03. This was the best time to strike a political bargain (with Kashmiris) and Congress failed to do that. I am not sure what Modi can do. This shows reluctance from the Center (Left or Right) or reluctance from Kashmiris or both to strike a bargain.

&gt;we lost major face wrt to Pakistan.

362,"How should we judge failure or success in diplomacy? We can either look at the governments stated objectives and whether it achieves them. Or, we can see whether the long term trajectory of India's role in the International System is strengthened or weakened in the current regime. 

As regards stated objectives, I think the government has been a disappointment. Modi clearly outlined his goals - India was so pathetic that Indians should be embarrassed of who they were. India was so weak that all our neighbours could push us around. This, at a time when - India was increasingly recognised as a great power, via the US Nuclear Deal mostly; developed working partnerships with regional powers like Japan, Vietnam; was instrumental in creating an international alliance for reforming global institutions, BRICS, IBSA, and the Group of 4; had more or less succeeded in de-linking with Pakistan, and making the case that Pakistan was the epicentre of instability in South Asia. All this, in the context of one of the fastest growing economies, that was poised to become one of the biggest. 

Now, this was, according to Modi, India at its weakest and most embarrassing. If we take this as the base, how fundamentally has India moved beyond the situation? I would say, we have moved backwards. BRICS is almost dead, relations with our neighbours, especially China, are worse than before; the United States is once again speaking of mediating between India and Pakistan; with rising religious fundamentalism in India, we are looking more and more 'like' Pakistan rather than a progressive, liberal democracy - the beating India's image has taken internationally in the past two years is monumentally huge. And the stated objectives of NSG or UNSC are still a pipe dream. In fact, with a society that seems to be regressing, in the eyes of the international community, we are perhaps further away from being 'given' a UNSC seat than before. 

In this analysis, it would be safe to say, Modi's diplomacy is not a success. 

But, if you see the long term trajectory, India has been on a path of increased importance in the International System, on the back of our vibrant democracy and growing economy, for the past three decades, at least, after a dip post-Nehru. This government has been doing a reasonable job in continuing the trajectory. The Economy could be better, but it could be a lot worse too - we are more or less stable atm, democracy is under pressure from religious fundamentalists but our institutions are still strong; while there is a rising strain of authoritarianism, civil society is robustly democratic. In this regard, I would say Modi is not doing too badly, although his mistakes in handling Pakistan could prove to be disastrous in the long run. ",2017-04-20 10:06:37

364,"PM Narendra Modi had on Monday said that government is contemplating a legislation that will make it mandatory for the doctors to prescribe generic drugs.

---

&gt; * A study in Indian Journal of Pharmacology found that while generic versions were less expensive than the branded ones, the retail margin on generic variants was way higher -sometimes more than 1,000 per cent of the manufacturer's price.This implies that retailers have a strong financial incentive to push generic drugs, even if doctors prescribe branded.

&gt; * But doctors say all generic drugs sold under different name do not have similar quality.

&gt; * The fact that quality of generic drugs sold under various trade names for same molecule is not uniform, hence lack of trust on the less popular ones, said another doctor.Ironically , India is one of the world's largest exporters of generic drugs.

&gt; * For doctors to prescribe generic drugs, it is crucial that the laws regarding drug testing and quality assurance are strengthened, the IMA president clarified.Prime Minister Modi, while speaking at a function to inaugurate a charitable hospital in Gujarat on Monday, said the government will bring in a legal framework by which if a doctor writes a prescription, he has to write in it that it will be enough for patients to buy generic medicines and he need not buy any other medicines.

**Modi government is rolling out the red carpet for foreign investors like never before** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The proposed dismantling of Foreign Investment Promotion Board , which vets proposals involving fund inflows from overseas, is likely to be bundled with related policy reforms.On top of the list is doing away with prior government approval for investments in most sectors, including single-brand retail, which could see dilution of the 30% domestic sourcing clause.“Contours of the proposed changes to the foreign direct investment policy are almost ready... Non-strategic sectors should be on automatic,” said a senior government official privy to discussions on the matter.With domestic private investment not picking up, the government is largely counting on foreign funds to speed up infrastructure creation. India needs an estimated $1.5 trillion over 10 years to build infrastructure such as roads, airports and power projects.The latest round of FDI reforms is aimed at making the process easier for foreign investors.“The multiple layers in clearance often lead to unnecessary delays,” the official said, justifying the decision to put more sectors on the automatic approval route.Most sectors have automatic approval for investments up to 49%. Government approval is required for investments in sectors such as telecom services, food products retailing, mining and minerals, multi-brand retail and private security agencies.In most cases, approval is required for investments exceeding 49%, but in some such as multibrand retailing, approval is needed for any level of investment.In mining and minerals, 100% FDI is allowed but government approval is required. Many of these sectors could be freed up in the policy review.Top government officials have already discussed details of the new FDI regime and a call will be taken shortly.The finance ministry, separately, has moved a draft cabinet note for dismantling FIPB The proposal to phase out FIPB in 2017-18 was made in the Budget presented on February 1. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government had undertaken substantive reforms in FDI policy over the past two years and more than 90% of the total FDI inflows were now through the automatic route.Jaitley said FIPB has implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI applications and had reached a stage where it could be abolished.The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion has been authorised to vet and recommend foreign investment proposals to the finance minister. The government is keen to remove even that layer by abolishing the need for approvals for most sectors. In such cases, the sector regulators are likely to be charged with ensuring foreign investment is compliant with limits and policy.Foreign direct investment up to 49% in the single-brand retail sector is allowed via the automatic route, without prior approval, but proposals beyond that level require government consent. India allowed 100% FDI in the sector in 2012.The government is likely to relax the rule and allow investment in single-brand retail under the automatic route.Single-brand retailers bringing FDI beyond 49% have to adhere to stringent 30% local sourcing norms but sections within the government favour diluting the clause as marquee brands come in completely manufactured form, including packaging.A call on this would be taken after deliberations as the government is also keen to push manufacturing and job creation in the country.Equity FDI into India increased 69% to $96.1 billion during October 2014-January 2017 from $57 billion in the July 2012-September 2014 period, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said earlier this month.FIPB is logical as 90% of the FDI now comes through the automatic route. Besides, sectoral regulation is also strong. The government should allow foreign investment to freely flow in retail. It would help retailers grow and promote foreign investment in manufacturing by mid-size companies.

Yamuna in Delhi last year, it is the government and the court who should take
the blame, because they allowed the event.

""If, at all, any fine has to be levied, it should be levied on the Central and

was so fragile and pure, they should have stopped the World Culture Festival,""

A team of experts has testified to the National Green Tribunal that the event

, which included a 7-acre stage for musicians and dancers and sprawled across
1,000 acres, had ""completely destroyed"" the riverbed.

disallowed, but the National Green Tribunal said it was too late to call off

Until recently, I was hoping that the Modi wave had died down and people would start tiring of these things and be more critical of him and the BJP. But I was in for a rude shock when I heard my colleagues singing praises about Modi and Yogi Adityanath.       

They probed me on my political views, and when I told them I voted AAP in the 2014 general elections, they subtly ridiculed me for not voting BJP, saying ""there is no use voting for anyone else"" and that my vote was ""wasted"".

As for your general points, I don't think you should look only at the upper class. India is parodoxical in the sense that the most tolerant people are often some of the poorest. In fact, BJP draws some of its strongest support among the ""educated"" and ""moderate"" members of the supposed 'middle-class'(read: top 10%).

What could counter Hindutva isn't necessarily going to be high-minded secularism as much as opposing tribal politics. Hindutva inevitably tend to be captured by the high-caste people you are supposedly condemning. And that capture tends to be cascading down onto dalits and adivasis and other hindus. 

Plus, the Hindi imposition issue also tends to come with Hindutva, which limits its progression in the South and North-East. 

It's possible that Modi learned from previous mishaps, but it's also possible that even if that's the case, it won't be enough. I think it's too narrow to view the opposition to Hindutva purely through the lens of secularism. Opposition has historically been broader, which is why it has been contained for most of the last 70 years. Those dams are now slowly breaking, but everything can be rebuilt. We'll see.

Now he has personally approved of Yogi and of course UP is turning into a religious minefield. Instead of pushing for jobs, they are attacking the few employment opportunities for youth. Instead of development, we get religious dogma. 

Modi's defenders will always leap to his defence, but his transformation from a supposedly non-sectarian development guy into the chief enabler of Hindutva was very brisk. Shame on those of us who believed the lies the first time. But at least we won't do it twice. Too bad Congress is an utter mess as well. Not a very cheery 2019 election coming up.

**Red beacons for VIPs banned from May 1, even vehicles of PM and President not exempt** 

 ______ 
The government decided on Wednesday to ban red beacons atop cars of all ministers, politicians and bureaucrats, ending a privilege that was seen as the ultimate status symbol.

The ban, effective from May 1, doesn’t exempt even vehicles of the country’s top dignitaries such as the President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India.

But ambulances and vehicles of the fire service, police, and army will be allowed to use blue flashing beacons to cut through traffic.

About six categories of beacons — primarily red, blue and yellow — are in use in India. But the red, or the coveted “lal batti”, has been drawing maximum attention as an elitist VIP symbol since the British rulers introduced it.

Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari called the decision historic, and tweeted: “Usage of red beacon tied us back to colonial legacy. With lal batti removal PM Narendra Modi’s vision of new India took a step forward.”

Every Indian is special. Every Indian is a VIP. https://t.co/epXuRdaSmY — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 19, 2017

The decision was taken at a meeting of road transport officials with the prime minister’s office on April 15. The Prime Minister informed his cabinet about the move on Wednesday.

“We have decided to remove the clause from the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, that gave the Centre and states the power to decide who should be allowed to display red beacons. The road ministry will shortly notify the amended rules,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said.

The Centre’s move follows decisions by the Uttar Pradesh and Punjab chief ministers, Yogi Adityanath and Captain Amarinder Singh, to discard beacons from official cars in their states.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took the lead in 2015 by asserting he would not have the red beacon on his car.

Union ministers such as M Venkaiah Naidu and junior home minister Kiren Rijiju have never used one since they joined the Modi’s council. Gadkari and Jitendra Singh, junior minister in the prime minister’s office, removed theirs on Wednesday.

The opposition Congress welcomed the step, but took a swipe at the BJP, saying it was good to see the ruling party catch up with the “progressive policies” of the previous government.

“The Supreme Court had given its verdict on December 10, 2013 about which cars be allowed and which ones not for use of red beacons. If after three-and-a-half years the BJP is trying to do politics over this and blow the trumpet of morality, then there can be nothing more laughable...,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said.

The top court called beacons atop cars of ministers and bureaucrats “ridiculous and synonymous with power”, and said these should be removed immediately. It advised the Centre and states later to amend the motor vehicles act to trim the list of people who can use beacons.

The road ministry had proposed limiting the privilege to five constitutional authorities — the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India, and Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The proposal was not approved.

According to the government, vehicles with beacon lights have no place in a democratic country.

People often saw these flashing lights as shining examples of power and VIP status, more than security aids. Even lower-level politicians and officials misuse the beacons to show off their importance, especially in smaller towns.

&gt;

Yes there are similarities but there are important differences as well. 

The world economy was rising much faster when Erdogan was the PM (2003-2014). Turkey had some of it best growth year under him. Turkey's economy more than tripled between 2000 and 2008. He made it seem like it was all because of him and the policies that he followed. That's why there is a lot of public good will riding over him.

India's bumper growth years came when BJP was in the opposition. Modi may have Erdogan like support in Gujarat but for rest of the country he is presiding over an economy which has yet to revive. Job scenarios are bad if not worse. Stimulus and subsidy may create illusion of rising prosperity but the economy is facing the same problems that it was facing during UPA2. 

Secondly Turkey is in a troubled neighborhood. Having a strong leader can help augment Turkey's power and allow the country to take the gamble that it wants to take. Think if Syria tomorrow can be rebuilt using Turkish man power and money. How many jobs could it create. A sort of neo-colonialism in Middle East. 

Can it happen in South Asia? Hell no. ",2017-04-20 18:05:25

What Modi is actually, is a brilliant politician, he will say whatever will get him the max votes. Now the issue isn't what he displays, issue is what's he gonna do? Looking so far i think he's going in a right direction. Though demonetisation, according to my opinion wasn't as effective as hoped to be and advertised, but atleast the motive behind this motive was purely against corruption and people have seen that and voted for that in UP.

Now about the assholes in the above video, they' well, assholes and will remain the same. These are the same people who were harassing people during Mayawati, Akhilesh. Whether things will change in UP will depend on how yogi takes these things. If yogi will let these morons off the hook, just because they spewed bullshit about ram mandir and hindutva, then he can say bye bye to next election.

**Loolhe langdon ko kaam pe rakha hai, UP minister mocks disabled man in Lucknow** 

 ______ 
During his monthly radio address - Mann Ki Baat - in December last year had said that physically-challenged people have a 'divine ability' and the term divyaang should be used in place of viklang for them. However, a leader of his party, who is also a minister in Uttar Pradesh's Yogi Adityanath government seems to care little about PM Modi's advice.

Uttar Pradesh textile minister Satyadev Pachauri was on a inspection visit to his department in Lucknow. During his interaction with the officials, Pachauri spotted a disabled man. He enquired the man about what work he does in the department.

The man told the minister he works as cleaner. Hearing his reply, the minister turned towards the officials and said,"" Loolhe langdon ko kaam pe rakha hai (You have employed a crippled, what work he will do?)""

Pachauri, who represents Kanpur's Govind Nagar seat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, also is also heard asking about the salary the man gets.

MINISTER CLARIFIES

Minister Satyadev Pachauri later clarified that his statement was misinterpreted by the media.

""The man appeared to be weak. I asked the officials to hire another person for his help that's it. But media presented my statement in bad light,"" Pachauri said.

**Kolkata cleric on Sonu Nigams head shaving act: He wanted to get rid of lice** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Bitter spat between Sonu Nigam, Kolkata cleric Syed Sha Atef Ali Al Quaderi continues.

2 Sonu shaved his head to get rid of lice, says the Muslim cleric.

3 Sonu Nigam must follow norms of the land if he wants to stay in India, Quaderi adds.

Sonu Nigam and Kolkata cleric Syed Sha Atef Ali Al Quaderi appear to be in no mood to put an end to the ongoing ugly spat between them. Hours after the Bollywood singer 'accepted' the challenge from the Muslim cleric to shave his head, Quaderi said Sonu Nigam probably wanted to get rid of lice.

""Sonu Nigam wanted to get rid of lice...and wanted to escape the summer heat, so got his head shaved. He has completed on a part of my challenge. Two conditions remain to be accepted,"" Quaderi told reporters during a press conference in Kolkata.

The Muslim cleric, who was flanked by Kalighat Temple priest and Keshav Chatterjee and Father S. Chatterjee during the press conference, said Sonu Nigam should leave India if he has issues with azaan and mandir ka ghanta.

(Photo: India Today/Tapan Kumar Naskar)

""If he wants to stay in India, he will have to follow the norms of the land. He must tolerate azaan and mandir ka ghanta alike,"" Quaderi said, adding,"" Sonu Nigam must complete the remaining two challenges - wear a garland of old torn shoes and a tour around the country - to win the Rs 10 lakh prize money that I had announced.""

'I SALUTE MODI'

Citing an instant when Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped his speech midway for azaan, the Kolkata cleric said one should learn from the prime minister.

""I salute PM Modi. He stopped speaking as soon as azaan was heard from a nearby mosque and waited till it got over. Both PM Modi and Mamata Bannerjee respect the Constitution of the country and know how to show respect to every religion,"" he added.

Canvassing for West Bengal Assembly elections 2016, PM Narendra Modi had stopped his speech midway after hearing azaan in West Midnapore district.

""Excuse me, azaan was on. Because of me, there should not be any problem to anyone's worshiping, so I paused for a few minutes,"" PM Modi said, before resuming his speech.

**No VIP: In Electricity 'Raid', Mulayam Singh's Home Is Busted** 

 ______ 
UP electricity officials conducted a check on Samajwadi Party patriarch
Mulayam Singh's house.

**Lucknow: **

The 'No VIP' emphasis of Yogi Adityanth's new government in Uttar Pradesh
extended today to former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav - one of his homes
failed a surprise inspection and was found to be guilty of mega power theft.

The delinquent residence is the 77-year-old's sprawling home in Etawah, his
constituency in Western Uttar Pradesh.

Electricity officials visited the house - Mualyam Singh was in Lucknow - and
found that the permissible limit of 5 kW a day was being busted by eight
times. Mulayam Singh also owes Rs 4 lakh in unpaid bills for this property.

He has been given till the end of the month to pay up.

Officials changed the configurations to allow him 40 kW - the amount that's
being consumed now - but he will have to pay for the larger allotment.

Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party was in power till March, when the BJP, led by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won the prize state with the biggest mandate in
nearly three decades.

After taking office a month ago, Yogi Adityanath has made it clear that his
administration will focus on curtailing the rampant corruption that is
synonymous with Uttar Pradesh. He has also pledged to cut the ""goonda raj"" or
lawlessness that he says flourished during the governments of Mulayam Singh,
his son Akhilesh Yadav, and their political rival Mayawati.

416,"Bah I knew anti-nationals like you would bring the British Empire founded RBI to support your anti-development pro-corruption arguments!

What do those jokers at RBI know about anything other than sticking to their founding agenda to keep Indians poor?  

For 80 years, they couldn't even get the banks to open accounts for all Indians, Modi-ji managed to achieve it in just 2 years with his Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. (A program and idea that didn't come from the RBI.) 

RBI  couldn't even come up with the demonetisation plan by themselves, Modi-ji had to literally give them the entire plan and the RBI board of governors simply rubber stamped it. 

These jokers didn't even know how to print the right size of currency notes and single handedly derailed Modi-ji's masterplan for painless demonetisation where ATMs were only going to be out of order for 2 days and not 6+ months.

And all those rule changes post Nov 8th, even that couldn't come from RBI, Modi-ji had to get someone from the FInance Ministry to create and announce new rules everyday to dynamically adapt to the daily changes in situation. (Again RBI just rubber stamped all these wonderful rules which made demonetisation a cake walk for all the honest citizens of India and only corrupt rich black money hoarders suffered.)


It's been over 5 months, and RBI buffoons haven't even managed to count how many notes were returned post Nov 8th.  That's simple arithmetic and they can't even arrive at that number. (Modi-ji's gujju genes helped him count and know exactly how much money would come back on Nov 8th itself. I don't know why he doesn't just send the number to RBI and get them to rubber stamp that too.)


Do you really these RBI buffoons are even capable of understanding  high tech stuff like #DIgiDhan? And how to promote it?

That's  why Modi-ji has been forced to use the private entity like NPCI to promote his #DigiDhan scheme and privately built and operated BHIM App. Because if you try to get RBI to build something modern, we'll end up stupid technologies like NEFT and RTGS which work like RBI employees and don't work after sunset or on holidays.

So who was responsible for the Defence Ministry taking such a 'bold' decision against the army? 

Especially when it involved three key factors:

* The army's first objection was that the bridging equipment was stored across various army cantonments. Transporting these to Delhi would req-uire a major logistical effort and expense. 

* The second reason was that these bridges comprised valuable operational equipment, which had a finite service life in terms of the number of times they could be launched. The army argued that this limited service life should be safeguarded for war. 

* The third reason was the impropriety of deploying military troops for what it considered a private function

422,"BJP Gains as Cracks Appear in West Bengal's Consensus on Communal Harmony

---

&gt;* The inescapable reality is that the Contai South elections were held soon after the incredible rallies by the BJP-RSS and their associates showcasing a revival of militant Hinduism through processions of sword wielding activists to celebrate Ram Navami.

&gt;* More than that, the BJP has made it respectable across the country to think that communal harmony and religious tolerance are not worthy values, thereby making it possible to openly profess till now privately, almost secretively held anti-Muslim opinion in West Bengal.

&gt;* The space to launch this appeal has opened up for the BJP because the CPI(M) has not only grown weaker, but its capacity to lead has diminished, the Congress is reduced to a small party and there is no real and robust opposition in West Bengal.

&gt;* The procession in Chandernagore in Hooghly district against communalisation of politics on last week attracted local attention, but overall the CPI(M) lacks the ability to reach out and hold on to voters who have either switched sides or are disgruntled with the Trinamool Congress and uncertain about the BJP.

&gt;* The visual messages that Banerjee has communicated through gestures that identify her affinity to the Muslim community have added to the misgivings of the Hindu poor and the middle classes, where memories of Partition and the violence that preceded it and followed it, the forced displacements, all remain deeply embedded.

**No VIP: In Electricity 'Raid', Mulayam Singh's Home Is Busted** 

 ______ 
UP electricity officials conducted a check on Samajwadi Party patriarch
Mulayam Singh's house.

**Lucknow: **

The 'No VIP' emphasis of Yogi Adityanth's new government in Uttar Pradesh
extended today to former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav - one of his homes
failed a surprise inspection and was found to be guilty of using way more
electricity than allowed.

The delinquent residence is the 77-year-old's sprawling home in Etawah, his
constituency in Uttar Pradesh. Located in the Civil Lines area, the bungalow
is one of the biggest in the city with more than a dozen rooms, its own air-
conditioning plant, a temperature-controlled swimming pool and several
elevators.

Electricity officials visited the house - Mualyam Singh was in Lucknow - and
found that the permissible limit of 5 kW a day was being busted by eight
times. Mulayam Singh also owes Rs 4 lakh in unpaid bills for this property.

He has been given till the end of the month to pay up.

Mulayam Singh's bungalow in Etawah is one of the biggest in the area.

Officials changed the configurations to allow him 40 kW - the amount that's
being consumed now - but he will have to pay for the larger allotment.

""We are conducting a drive to stop power theft, check overloading and recover
dues,"" said Ashutosh Varma, an officer leading the team that conducted the
check. Asked why this wasn't done before, he said, ""We did not have 40 kW
metres earlier. Now we do.""

Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party was in power till March, when the BJP, led by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won the prize state with the biggest mandate in
nearly three decades.

After taking office a month ago, Yogi Adityanath has made it clear that his
administration will focus on curtailing the rampant corruption that is
synonymous with Uttar Pradesh. He has also pledged to cut the ""goonda raj"" or
lawlessness that he says flourished during the governments of Mulayam Singh,
his son Akhilesh Yadav, and their political rival Mayawati.

436,"You seem to think you've revealed something earth-shattering that will shake the very foundations of the ""bhakts"". You're mistaken. Perhaps your agenda is fogging your judgement so allow me to clear it up a bit:

* It is not even *close* to being a surprise that cash transactions went up as the supply of notes came back to normal. - as much as the butthurt crowd hates to admit it.
* It was *absolutely expected* because, as everyone knows, cash is convenient, especially for small transactions. It was the initial spike that was the anomaly because it was caused directly by the *total unavailability* of cash. It makes zero sense to include anomalous data when we know that the conditions during that were absurdly different.
* The only time that digital was going to supplant cash for tiny transactions was during DeMo when there was an acute shortage of change. (Hint: there's a reason PayTM/eWallets/banks waived transaction fees *during* DeMo, but not *after*)
* Digital has been introduced **to the vendors**. It is now an option that will continue to grow at a more natural pace (ignoring the forced spike during DeMo). The ciggy-stall and the little bakery next to this place I recently visited in a crappy part of U.P., have PayTM now. They didn't accept anything other than cash, till 6 months back. In Bangalore, I've basically not visited a single ATM since January. ATMs are out of cash again? Whooptydoo.
* The supply of large denomination notes was kept far far lower during the remonetization process. Meaning that people are either going to have to dig into those (renewed Black Money) stashes soon, or use digital.
* DeMo did not occur in a vacuum. It was *never* a single-shot-single-goal - a fact that the opposition is *desperate* to erase from public memory. It linked in with policies that came before it (aadhaar, amnesties, jan-dhan, etc) and those that are coming after it (GST, IT returns, Electoral Bonds, money-bill, caps on cash payments, etc). Military analogy: An F-35 JSF is a pretty mediocre fighter by itself. [Could probably be taken out by a 20+ year-old plane if it was alone](https://www.sofmag.com/f-35-vs-f-16/). But connect it with the rest of the network of the US military, and it becomes something else altogether. 
* That's the mistake that the rabidly anti-Modi crew keep making. They look at each policy by itself and start howling about how it will ""destroy the fabric of our nation"" and ""uproot our economy"", and all that locusts-and-plagues Biblical bullshit that never happened, just as the ""bhakts"" predicted. 
* Your hatred for people who disagree with you by clubbing them under the ""bhakts"" umbrella is rather pitiful. It makes you seem rather angry and impotent - can't find anything to say so you resort to petulant name-calling. Not surprising though. I'm sure I'll be hearing from you about how several of my points have caused UNESCO to certify me as a ""Bhakt"" too. Of course, since you're really a wise man, I will expect you to upvote my comment, unlike my policy to downvote anyone who uses the term ""Bhakt"" seriously in a conversation.

Politics is corruption free etc etc. I am sure many wont agree with this agenda, and not just because its utopian.

This caste politics was also mentioned in Wikileaks..

**Modi and Caste**

*Caste resentments exacerbate the bad feelings between Modi and much of the state party's leadership. Modi heralds from a so-called Other Backward Caste (OBC), while many of his opponents are from higher castes, and in particular from the Patel caste that dominates public life in the state. The Chief Minister is openly distrustful of the higher-caste party officials around him, yet is careful not to make caste an issue since he seeks the support of the Gujarati commercial class, most of whom are Patels or other higher castes. Gujarat Congress spokesman Himanshu Vyas told us his party hopes to play the caste card in the 2007 elections to divide Modi's support among Hindus, yet none of our other interlocutors believed that caste issues could endanger a Modi victory at the polls. Some believe, however, that Modi's lower caste status could create problems for him in national politics.*",2017-04-21 07:01:01

Washington: Finance minister Arun Jaitley has “strongly raised” the H-1B visa issue with US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, highlighting the important role played by highly skilled Indian professionals in America, officials said.

During the meeting here—the first cabinet-level interaction between the two countries under the Trump administration—Ross is believed to have said that US has started the process of reviewing H-1B visas issues and no decision has been taken on it yet, people aware of the matter said.

Taking up the case of Indian IT companies and professionals, Jaitley told Ross about the contribution of highly skilled Indians in the economic development of the United States and India and stressed that they should continue to do so, which is in the best interest of the two countries, an Indian official said.

Ross is understood to have said that whatever the outcome of the review process, the Trump administration’s objective is to have a merit-based immigration policy that gives preference to highly skilled professionals.

The executive order signed by Trump early this week calls for a review of H-1B visas by the departments of state, labour, homeland security and justice. Jaitley, leading an Indian delegation, arrived in Washington DC on Thursday morning to attend the annual Spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Over the next two days, the finance minister is scheduled to hold a series of bilateral meetings with his counterparts from the US, Australia, France, Indonesia and Sweden. He is also likely to meet finance ministers from neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Stressing that India-US relationship has bipartisan support in both the countries, the finance minister in his meeting with the commerce secretary said the two largest democratic countries of the world over the years have developed strong strategic, economic and defence relationship.

The three phone conversations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump have had, along with the officials meeting, has shown that the two governments are going to build on this momentum in the years to come, the official said.

Briefing Ross on India’s growth story, Jaitley is believed to have given an him insight into a series of “far reaching reforms” being undertaken by the Modi government post-demonetisation including the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Jaitley said the two countries should be able to move towards achieving the goal of $500 billion per annum in bilateral trade in the next few years. In addition to his meetings and presentations at the annual Spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, the Union minister is also scheduled to attend meetings of other multilateral forums including that of the G-20 finance ministers.

Before leaving Washington DC for New York on Sunday, he is expected to interact with think-tanks and eminent Indian- Americans. PTI

**The dangers of Hindi chauvinism** 

 ______ 
One of the most detailed debates in the Constituent Assembly was whether Hindi should be the official language of India. Even today, anybody reading the brilliant debates in the constituent assembly may be puzzled by why so much time was spent on the language issue compared to many other more fundamental constitutional design challenges. B.R. Ambedkar later revealed that no other issue had generated as much heat as the one on the official language of the new republic. Hindi was accepted by a slim margin of one vote. It was supposed to replace English in 1965 as the language of government. The status quo was maintained after violent agitations in several states of peninsular India.

Indian nationalists have for long recognized that a diverse country such as ours needs a common language for communication. The natural candidate for that is either the language most commonly spoken in India or the classical language of Indian civilization—Hindi or Sanskrit. The Zionists united Israel by reviving Hebrew. The overwhelming majority of national leaders—from M.K. Gandhi to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar—wanted some variant of Hindi. Ambedkar argued for Sanskrit and Subhas Chandra Bose was in favour of Hindi written in the Roman script.

All these issues have come to a head once again—be it the decision to have milestones on national highways in Tamil Nadu written in Hindi, the advice given by the Central government that all its ministers should make their speeches in Hindi, or making Hindi compulsory in schools. Such impositions will quite naturally come up against opposition in states that have cultural identities based on other languages. India is not Pakistan, but it is useful to remember that the imposition of Urdu on the Bengalis was the first catalyst of the movement that eventually created Bangladesh.

There are a few issues that need clarity. First, Hindi is best placed as a language to ease communication between different states. It cannot be seen as a replacement for local languages as a lingua franca.

Second, the discussion has been about Hindi as an official language of the Indian nation. It is not meant to be a national language.

Third, native Hindi speakers who are puzzled at the opposition to the imposition of their language on other citizens should ask themselves how many other Indian languages they have tried to learn.

Fourth, India finally accepted a system of linguistic states because of the realities of sub-national identity that should never be ignored.

The point to be made is that the forced spread of Hindi is a disservice that Hindi chauvinists are doing to their own language. Their insensitive actions will have angry reactions—and that is the last thing India needs at this juncture. Hindi chauvinism has had several unthinking champions. Even sophisticated leaders such as the socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia and the great scholar Rahul Sankrityayan—though not chauvinists —did not take account of the reaction in other parts of India to their aggressive insistence of Hindi. The Narendra Modi government has its ideological roots in the Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan way of thinking. It should not be stoking the dying embers of linguistic conflict.

The curious fact is that Hindi has very peacefully spread across the country over the past 50 years. Few would today remember the language riots in what was then Madras. Hindi cinema has done a lot to make the language understood in most parts of the country; it may not be the pure Hindi that was mercilessly lampooned in the 1970s comedy Chupke Chupke, but a more open variant that has absorbed even the lingo of the Mumbai streets. Cable television has also helped this process in more recent years.

A traveller can today hear Hindi spoken in most corners of the country. The language is bound to spread further in the coming years thanks to migration, commerce and entertainment. That should be welcomed. What should not be welcomed is either the force-feeding of the language with colonial intent or seeing it as a substitute for Gujarati, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, etc., in their respective states. The eighth schedule of the Constitution lists 22 national languages. Hindi can be the first among equals. It cannot hope to become the only one.

These are crucial issues that the most aggressive votaries of Hindi often forget. India has seen language riots when the republic was young. We are now a more mature nation—and reopening those old wounds is pointless. Especially when Hindi has peacefully spread across the country and can live with other Indian languages.

**Civic polls more about black money, nationalism: BJP** 

 ______ 
BJP star campaigner Ravi Kishan at the rally in Dwarka on Thursday. Tashi Tobgyal BJP star campaigner Ravi Kishan at the rally in Dwarka on Thursday. Tashi Tobgyal

AT THE edge of Delhi, 24 hours before campaigning for the MCD polls ends, the BJP at a rally in Dwarka explained why the polls are so important for the party and why their poll issues have little to do with civic issues.

Bhojpuri actor and BJP campaigner Ravi Kishan summarised, “You’re here because of Modi”, while Union Textile minister Smriti Irani said, “Narendra Modi is the leader and Amit Shah, the guide for India”. But BJP MP Parvesh Singh Verma explained it more clearly.

“It’s a civic poll, what will Modi do? I asked him. The way he made Gujarat shine when he was there, that’s how he will make Delhi shine… If we win, it’ll be Modi ji’s izzat (honour) that’ll increase,” he said.

That the BJP’s election campaign revolves around the PM is no longer a surprise. For the past three years, chants of “Har Har Modi” and “Bharat mata ki jai” have punctuated the party’s rallies across India.

But even BJP leaders admit that they have never seen such an intense campaign for the MCD polls. Nor have the main poll planks been so noticeably devoid of the traditional issues of “bijli, paani, makan”. The focus, instead, was on nationalism, Pakistan, black money and BJP’s dream of a ‘Congress mukt bharat’.

Take, for instance, Kishan who argued that a victory in the MCD elections was the first step to ensure “that we are greater than China, America’s equal and so that Pakistan doesn’t dare raise its head”. Or Verma, who made the case that “poor people knew that demonetisation had helped them” and that “IB officers were present outside opposition party offices” to ensure that their black money “goes bad”.

Meanwhile, signs welcoming BJP president Amit Shah outside the venue were hastily replaced with ones welcoming Irani. BJP leaders explained that Shah “had a sore throat” and couldn’t make it. Even though his absence was noticeable, it mattered little. As Ram Kumar Jha, a construction worker, put it, “The MCD polls are the ones which will impact us the most. Today, MPs and cabinet ministers are here. What more can one ask for?” The closest anyone came to talking about a traditional issue was Irani, who spoke of the water problem in Dwarka.

Pointing to the stage, she added, “I’m a Cabinet minister, we have an MP, councillor candidates, MLAs and party workers. There’s no distinction, we are all working towards the betterment of India. Is this possible in the Congress?”

As the rally drew to a close, chants of “Bharat Mata ki Jai” mingled with the roar of evening traffic and Bhojpuri music from the stage. A BJP worker in the crowd explained, “This isn’t noise. It’s the sound of BJP, winning. Soon, all governments in India will be BJP governments.”

**Opinion: The Breathless Praise For Modi In ""Getting"" Vijay Mallya** 

 ______ 
There is something pathological about how we report and respond to news these
days. Whatever may have happened, even if relatively routine and predictable,
is presented as one of three or four narratives, mostly to do with Narendra
Modi.

This was particularly visible in the amusing series of events that occurred
when Vijay Mallya was arrested yesterday for fraud in England. Some reporters
tweeted, to general acclaim, that he was about to be ""handed over to India"".
Various open, surreptitious, or aspiring members of the BJP declared that this
was a sign of Narendra Modi's strength, universal popularity, and incomparable
knowledge of the British judicial system. Ministers declared that it was a
great victory for Modi, of course, but also their ministry in particular
somehow. Meanwhile, those unsympathetic to Modi wondered warily how precisely
to respond to this news without sounding sympathetic to Vijay Mallya, another
indication of how poor the narrative-building of the Opposition has been. Oh,
and the three people still left in the Congress sought to give the credit to
Rahul Gandhi. (I'm not making this up - some people tried to point out that he
kept on mentioning Vijay Mallya's name at rallies, and claimed that Mallya
himself blamed the opposition for demonising him.)

All this noise for a story that, in the end, was revealed to be farcical and
predictable. Mallya was granted bail with the promptness one expects from the
people who invented habeas corpus. He then stepped out of the court and
promptly - showing all the crowd-pleasing instinct that made him briefly the
King of Good Times - tweeted that it was all a bit of hype from that crazy
Indian media, and all that had happened was that a long-predicted extradition
process had begun.

It was particularly galling that Mallya was on this occasion right. A note
requesting Mallya's extradition had been sent months ago to Whitehall, and had
been certified by the Home Secretary and delivered to the Westminister
Magistrates' Court weeks ago. The Ministry of External Affairs said as much in
its daily press conference on March 24; Mallya was bound to be briefly and
procedurally arrested after that. The real question of whether his extradition
will succeed does not depend on this process as such; it depends on whether
the government makes the case sufficiently well in the extradition hearing. It
will have to focus there on claims of fraud rather than on walking out on
investors. This will not be easy, and Mallya is unsurprisingly still looking
confident.

Just to be clear on how difficult the process has been till now: the UK-India
extradition treaty came into force in 1992, and the first reported extradition
order was signed by the Home Secretary Amber Rudd last year. That's right -
last year, 2016, 24 years after the treaty. Plus, and this is important, the
person being extradited, Samir Patel, did not contest the extradition (which
Mallya will, noisily). We don't know why he didn't. Patel was facing charges
of rioting in Gujarat in 2002, had escaped to Hounslow, but was now suddenly
and mysteriously quite willing to come back - make of that what you will.

Liquor baron Vijay Mallya was granted bail three hours after he was arrested
in London (File photo)

This is not to say that the government cannot try to claim some credit if it
wishes; clearly, the original extradition request was competently enough
framed to satisfy a British district judge - not always certain, given the
competence of the Indian government. And the Opposition can clearly keep on
reminding people that it was this government, not the previous one, that let
the BJP-supported then-Rajya Sabha MP out of the country in the first place.
The Central Bureau of Investigation actually changed the look-out notice it
had posted for Mallya at airports from ""don't let him leave"" to ""send us a
postcard by regular mail if you happen to see him skipping town"". Certainly,
nobody has been held to account for that mistake - if it was a mistake.

Mallya's extradition case will be messy, and it is absurd to declare victory
so soon. Just to point out exactly how tough these cases can be, consider the
case of ""Tiger"" Hanif, accused of complicity in the 1993 Surat bomb blasts,
and supposedly an associate of Dawood Ibrahim. Hanif was arrested in
Manchester in 2010; and his case has worked its way through the courts to land
eventually on Theresa May's desk when she was Home Secretary. May didn't sign
it, although a high court judge had already declared there was ""no arguable
basis"" against his extradition. Nor did the woman May appointed as her
successor when she herself was elevated to Number 10. If ""Tough on Crime,
Muslims and Immigrants"" Theresa May dithered over throwing a bearded chap
nicknamed ""Tiger"" out of the country, Mallya might be there for a long while
yet.

Which brings us back to the breathlessness of the whole thing. Since 2014, we
have been so inundated with this government praising itself that we do not
know how to respond to even the most incremental news in any way other than
ecstatic or dismissive. This is a real problem - because it means that we lose
sight of the real, sustained pressure, legal and diplomatic, that cases like
Mallya require. The Indian government did something marginally competent, and
let's praise it for that. And let's hold back on all the remaining praise
until they show they can keep it up for long enough to get Mallya back here
and facing an Indian judge.

450,"Spent a week in Delhi recently, people are not voting for BJP, they are voting for Modi. The lower-middle class folk that I talked to (think taxi drivers, auto-rickshaw drivers) said they would vote for AAP while others said they would vote for Modi. 

Those voting for Modi acknowledge that AAP has done some work, but they are annoyed with Kejriwal's barbs at Modi. Even though they accept that BJP has governed MCD for a decade and has been corrupt, they believe that with Modi at the helm things will change. Also, they believe that it's better for Delhi to have the same party in power in the state as the centre. 

Personally, I think that considering what BJP has done at the MCD over the last decade, it's stupid to give them another chance. However, if that's what the people want, that's what they will get. ",2017-04-21 10:11:55

**Let’s Talk About Trolls | Doesn’t matter if I voted for Modi or not, we have right to ask questions: Sonam Kapoor** 

 ______ 
Let’s get straight to the point. You might call me a ‘bimbo’, a ‘naachne wali’, but you know what, I’m a terribly self-assured woman. I have a strong sense of self and I don’t need you to tell me who I am. I would not have the balls to do what I do, wear what I wear or say what I say, if I didn’t have self-worth.

Each one of us should cherish who we are.

The trolls can be sexist and judgmental but I know I’m smart and capable of expressing an opinion. I’m a successful woman, a feminist, a humanist, a national award winner and I say this with a great sense of pride and satisfaction: I get to live a fairy tale life every single day. I walk the international stage, I’m an avid reader with a library full of books, I am a consumer of news, an engaged Indian and so very capable of having a discussion on any issue, with anyone. Just because I’m an actor, it doesn’t mean I can’t have an opinion.

I’ve spoken up often. I spoke up when the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film, Padmavati, were vandalised. I have spoken up against meat bans. I’ve taken sides with my colleagues and spoken up when Sonakshi Sinha was fat-shamed or Anushka Sharma, an amazingly talented actress, was picked on only because people think they have the right to comment on our sizes or our boyfriends.

I will always speak up. I am not a bimbo. When you use that word, it reflects on you, not me. Let’s loosen up guys. Let’s be witty; let’s engage, let’s agree to disagree; let’s cut out the abuse.

I think social media is a very effective tool. I’ve got endorsements because of my online presence, it helps me promote the charities I support and I’ve run amazing campaigns for my films, such as Neerja.

People think we don’t have brains because we dress up and look beautiful. Thankfully, I’m comfortable under my skin and in my head. I grew up learning Kathak and love to dance. I’m a student of Indian history and have walked into adulthood being proud of what India stands for. Think of all the beautiful movies that were made post-Independence when there was a sense of jubilation.

Back then, people were not afraid to question. They were unafraid of having an opinion and we weren’t a nation where you had to be politically correct. Now, you pounce on us when we criticise the government. Why can’t I criticise the government? Isn’t that what democracy is all about. It doesn’t matter whether I’ve voted for Narendra Modi or not. Either way, we have a right to ask questions.

I’m a proud Indian. I love my country but for some of you — and you’re the bigots, not me — I become ‘anti-national’ only because I ask questions or choose to be critical. Listen to the national anthem one more time. Recall the line you heard as kids, ‘Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Issai…’

I’m a practising Hindu but my best friends are Muslims and I’m not giving them sermons on why being a Hindu is something better. Nor, for that matter are they. By the way, I am a strict vegetarian. I don’t even eat eggs but I don’t have a problem with what anyone else eats. How can you choose for anyone else? How can you take freedom of choice — a fundamental right — away from anyone else?

The truth is, in public life, we do end up being role models. I have 10 million followers on Twitter and even if 10% of those are trolls, that’s still nine million people that I feel accountable to. I owe them an opinion, a peek into my mind, and that’s why I speak up. It is important to take sides and I do so without fear. Not taking a position is cowardice.

I admit that there have been times when I have reacted to the abuse that comes my way. Yes, I’ve fallen for the bait but have also apologised. I responded when author Shobhaa De said, “(Sonam Kapoor) doesn’t cut it in the sex appeal stakes.’’ My parents made me realise I was wrong to have hit out at her, saying, “60 something porn writer.” I’m glad that my father, Anil Kapoor, has helped me to focus on the glass half full. I’m glad he showed me the mirror.

Sensitivity is an important trait when you’re on social media. I’ve learnt to be a moderate. I’ve learnt also to try and engage with those who are critical so I don’t build walls around myself, but dear trolls, you need to be more intelligent. It’s easy for me to block and report you and I’ve done that liberally, but I’m also capable of forgiveness, for you know not what you do. Try and get out of your bigoted mindset. Else, you’re nothing but illiterate, uneducated extremists.

Sincerely,

A proud naachne-waali

PS: You should also try some naach-gaana. Mazaa aata hai, dil khush rehta hai aur dimaag thanda.

Actor Sonam Kapoor has catapulted her way to the top with the success of Neerja. She got a special mention National Award for her performance in the film that won the National Award for best Hindi feature film.

’STAR’ ABUSE Several film celebrities are viciously trolled and the remarks are deeply personal. Often, they make their displeasure known.

He responded: IT’S SO SAD AND DISGUSTING WHEN A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH MOVEMENT IS MADE INTO A MOCKERY BY SOME ON TWITTER!! SHAME!!! @karanjohar Sonakshi Sinha was fat-shamed for opposing a meat ban. The actress responded with a sarcastic tweet AND THE BEST PART IS, TROLLS THINK THEY ARE RELEVANT, WHILE WE CARRY ON WITH OUR HAPPY AND POSITIVE LIVES.

Since the BJP has come to power in the Centre and in UP recently these vigilantes have grown in strength with implicit backing of the RSS and BJP goons - Modi himself a staunch RSS sevak said “those who consider themselves great gau rakshaks” and then said that “**70-80 per cent** are involved in activities which have no place in society and they, therefore, don the mantle of gau rakshaks to hide their ills”. A day later, speaking in Telangana, Modi again referred to “fake cow protectors” but this time he called them a “**handful**”.

If one hears his speech, the **PM seems to not be denouncing ""true gau rakshaks""** but only the ""fake"" ones who are making profit out of it.

So, if any vigilante group is not after economic gain, but is taking the law into its own hands thanks to religious beliefs or political ideology, Prime Minister Modi apparently does not see it as a problem.

now they have come up with a new slogan ""New India"", they couldn't live upto their original expectations of ""Will change India's face in 100 days"", so they now sell a new dream which will remain a dream

465,"The problem in Kashmir is that lack of economic development and opportunities has made the locals angry and frustrated. The ISI has identified this and started an anti India wave in the valley. ISI used communal violence to drive out Kashimiri Pandits. They were reaping in huge benefits because after all the violence, the Indian government is only looking at Kashmir as a Law and order problem.

It isn't law and order problem at all. There are strong underground forces that are driving the agitations. When kashmiris grow up, most of them end up hating India because of the violence. We other Indians see this and think of Kashmiris as some sort of hate mongers who pelt stones when the Army is fighting terrorists. The Army has a right to defend themselves. But Army fighting the locals is not the solution to ultimate peace.

The root of the problem is lack of economic development, infrastructure and educational opportunities. What has worsen the situations? ISI's covert warfare and indoctrinating young kashmiris to commit violence against India and the huge egos of Indian politicians and their typical ignorance of the ground reality.

What could be the solution? Unleash development. If you want angry citizens to be part of your country, we have to show that the country is worth living in. We are not doing this right now. And we have to use our own Intelligence agencies to infiltrate this militants and thwart ISI in its own game!

Edit: please go and downvote all you want. This isn't a problem created by Modi government. Modi is only making it worse by sitting on his high horse. Decades of political ignorance is the reason.

471,"&gt; **sanctioning** 

This is the biggest trick politicians use to fool us. This is like those items in the manifesto. Back when Modi was the CM of Gujarat, he 'sanctioned' a much touted 50 lakh affordable house scheme. Just one year later it was followed up on by the Hindu:

&gt; [Gujarat’s low-cost housing promise no more than a pipedream](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gujarats-lowcost-housing-promise-no-more-than-a-pipedream/article4443788.ece)

&gt; The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat had promised in its 2012 election manifesto that it would build 50 lakh low-cost houses at a cost of Rs. 33,000 crore during the next five years, but the very first budget of the newly-elected Narendra Modi government has found just about Rs. 4,000 crore for the purpose.

&gt; By common arithmetic, at an average of Rs. 4,000 crore an annum, the estimated expenditure for the much-touted project has been slashed to Rs. 20,000 crore in five years — Rs. 13,000 crore less than the original cost.


Later in 2015 there was another follow up by Outlook:

&gt;  11th March 2015: **Just before the 2012 Assembly elections, CM Modi announced 50 lakh houses in five years. The Anandiben Patel government recently slashed it to 24 lakh houses.

**I Do Not Lack Political Will, PM Narendra Modi Tells Bureaucrats On Civil Services Day** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi spoke to the country's top bureaucrats on Civil Services Day
today

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today urged bureaucrats to change their mindset
and style of working and ""make excellence a habit"". He also stressed on
political will to push reforms and said - ""I do not lack it, I probably have
extra.""

Addressing the country's top officials in Delhi

, PM Modi said: ""With changing times, a need may arise that we may have to
change our working style. From regulator, we need to be an enabling entity.""

He was speaking at a function to mark the Civil Services Day. ""Earlier, the
role of the government, from healthcare to wanting to set up an industry, was
very strong. Things have been changing for the past 15 years,"" he said,
commenting that the days when people depended on the government for all their
needs were over.

This, he added, was the time for out-of-the-box thinking and confident
decisions. ""Your word is of great value. Your signatures can change things.
Can we change?""

In a strong dig at red tape, the PM said, ""During my PRAGATI sessions (the
platform where he reviews government work by interacting with officials) I
have found files and projects stuck for years are cleared in 24 hours. I learn
from this. If this can happen then it has to become a lesson for all.""

Questioning bureaucratic delays and tangles, he wondered: ""Why are government
departments fighting in courts against each other? Why is there one
government, two stands? Is it ego? Let is all think. This is clogging the
judicial system and causing delays and waste.""

Attacking an old bureaucratic habit of dressing statistics to present
achievements, he said, ""Does jugglery of statistics achieve anything? The
culture needed is outcome-centric vision for governance.""

While making his point,

he also shared why he had banned mobile phone in his meetings

. ""These days... I see district officials so busy, so busy, so busy,"" he said,
mimicking furious tapping on a phone keypad.

Officials should take decisions that are in national interest, said the Prime
Minister, urging his audience to take ""collective ownership"" to bring change.
""Don't make decisions which are temporary or offer a temporary fix for your
particular area...It is important to make ourselves relevant in changing times
or else, we will become irrelevant.""

The PM gave away awards for excellence based on the execution of the
government's priority programmes. Winding up his speech, he appealed to
bureaucrats: ""Think of the dreams you had when you were on your way to the IAS
academy and your parents came to see you off.""

**In big boost to preserve water, Narendra Modi government to construct barrages on all 100-mtr new bridges on National Highways** 

 ______ 
Representational image. (Source: PTI)

To deal with the increasing problem of water scarcity, Centre has decided to build barrages on all bridges on National Highways that are less than 100 meters in height. According to the report by Dainik Jagran, it will be mandatory to construct a barrage for bridges that are 100 meters or less in height. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has issued instructions to all the central and state agencies that are involved in the construction of roads in India to that effect, according to this report.

A letter was sent to all the state transport heads, NHEI, NHDCL and BRO on 18th April by the department, the report states. The letter highlighted the importance of conserving water for drinking as well as other purposes. Apart from this, the government also plans to use the old bridges that are no more in use for water conservation by constructing barrages on them. The government has instructed the Public Woks Departments (PWDs) of all the states to prepare a proposal and send the same as early as possible.

You may also want to watch:

Before creating this proposal, the Public Work Departments have been asked to consult with the water resource department and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Along with this, they will also have to get No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from various departments. The government has also issued guidelines for the construction of these barrages. The transport Ministry will bear the cost of maintenance of these barrages for the first three years along with the construction charges.

After three years, the state government will have to take care of all the maintenance related expenses. Narendra Modi government has been committed to solving the problem of drinking water in India and taking a step in this direction, PM had launched his flagship Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) as well. Constructing barrages at bridges will take the process one step ahead.

People are fed that he is a crazy arrogant man who keeps blaming Modi for no reason. It's true Kejriwal has been a little careless with his statements but many times what he says is taken out of context. Secondly, I don't think he really had much of a choice.
