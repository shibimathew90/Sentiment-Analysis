Also, if cashless was the end goal, wouldn't it have been easier to just roll out UPI, get some penetration and **then** carry out demonetization? Why do it in this way?

I get the feeling that your response is going to be ""because they didn't want their true intentions to be known."" If that's your thought process, then you don't really know Norman Haering's true intentions either, no? Maybe he's a KGB shill trying to malign the US. Maybe he's a conspiracy-peddling hack who hasn't got a single worthwhile publication to his name and so is trying to rustle up some interest.

Of course, maybe he's right. But I'd like to see some proof before we leap to that conclusion.

&gt; its not baseless claims the timeline fits,the people that are being connected to those organizations are also real and don't you know about US intervention for monetary gain?

It's still pretty baseless. ""The timeline fits"" and ""these organizations exists"" isn't a base. 

Both of those things are true for ""record level smog appeared in Delhi so Greenpeace pressured NaMo into making it harder to purchase crackers. Since crackers were mostly purchased in cash, NaMo declared demonetization to penalize cracker makers."" But obviously this theory is retarded, right? Timeline fits and organizations exist isn't proof. It's what a lawyer would call circumstantial (I assume, IANAL).",2017-01-17 05:47:01

International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook update slashing India’s growth prospects for 2016 by one percentage point has provided the Congress party and other Modi-baiters with another opportunity to attack the NDA government in Centre. In a series of tweets following the release of IMF report on Monday, the Congress claimed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had already warned of a slump in the economy in the beginning of demonetisation exercise announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016.

“Dr. Manmohan Singh warned against the drop in the beginning of demonetization. The ego of an individual has pushed billion ppl into trouble!,” the Indian National Congress tweeted. The party even accused Modi government of pushing India backwards on the line of government in Pakistan.

Overview of World Economic Outlook projections.

However, the party appears to have not read the details of the report in depth. As the party has already used IMF report to attack the government, here’s something that may force Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and other opposition leaders to recalibrate their strategy against Modi.

Dr. Manmohan Singh warned against the drop in the beginning of demonetization. The ego of an individual has pushed billion ppl into trouble! http://t.co/kO6RJaZN2Q — INC India (@INCIndia) January 16, 2017

Owing to “the temporary negative consumption shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions associated with the recent currency note withdrawal and exchange initiative, the IMF has slashed India’s forecast for 2016 from 7.6 to 6.6%. The forecast for 2017 has also been slightly reduced by 0.4%.

However, despite the “negative” IMF forecast for 2016 and 2017, as claimed by the critics of demonetisation, India would continue to grow faster than China in 2017 and 2018 by huge margins. For the year 2016, IMF has estimated growth in China to be at 6.7%, which is just 0.1% higher than India’s 6.6.

You May Also Like To Watch This

If the forecast is to be believed, Indian economy would take a big leap in the next two years. In 2017, India would grow at 7.2% and at 7.7% in 2018. In contrast, China would grow at 6.5% and 6.0% in the respective years.

ALSO READ I Demonetisation dilemma: Should you trust NaMo or MaMo?

The possibility of India growing more than the IMF forecast is also high. The report has mentioned that current trimming of India’s growth forecast is because of the “negative consumption”. However, with so much money available with banks after demonetisation and expected sops to be announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the upcoming Union Budget 2017, consumption pattern may grow faster than what have been estimated by the IMF for the forecast. Earlier, World Bank had also predicted healthy growth of Indian Economy in the years 2017 and 2018.

The next General Elections are scheduled for 2019. In the words of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, PM Modi would be “riding an elephant” if IMF forecast becomes true.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday tore into the opposition, chiefly Congress, over an array of issues, including demonetisation. . (ANI)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday tore into the opposition, chiefly Congress, over an array of issues, including demonetisation. PM Modi took a jibe at party vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s ‘earthquake’ remark, saying that the nation finally felt the tremors yesterday. “I was wondering why the earthquake came. When someone see ‘SEVA’ or any positive virtue in the word ‘SCAM’ then mother earth would definitely become upset,” PM Modi said while speaking on motion of thanks to President’s address in Lok Sabha.

Lashing out at Congress over the emergency declared during former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s tenure, the PM said: “We remember how democracy was under threat from 1975 to 1977, when opposition leaders were jailed, newspaper freedom curtailed.” Emphasizing the importance of ‘Jan Shakti’, the Prime Minister said that it is because of the people’s power that a person, born to a poor family became the Prime Minister of India. “Let us understand and appreciate inherent strength of our people and take India to newer heights. Faith in Jan Shakti will give results,” he added. Listing out the central government’s initiatives, Modi chose to retort to every criticism and allegations that were lobbed and levelled against his government.

“The nation wants to know the reason behind changing the rules 1035 times in MNREGA,” PM Modi said in Lok Sabha. “Crop insurance was in existence earlier also, but farmers didn’t want to avail it. It didn’t secure the rights of farmers,” Modi said.

Notably, PM Modi replied to the discussion on motion of thanks to President Pranab Mukherjee’s address to the joint sitting of Parliament in Lok Sabha today. The House concluded discussion last night. The motion was moved by Tourism Minister Dr Mahesh Sharma.

Initiating the discussion, Sharma hit out at the opposition saying that politics should not be played with religion and security forces. He also criticised the opposition for seeking proof about the surgical strikes carried out by the Army last year across the LoC. Sharma highlighted the achievements of the government and said it is committed to provide good, transparent and corruption free governance. He said schemes launched by the Centre are focusing towards poor, farmer and deprived sections of the society.

Participating in the debate, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge tried to corner the government on the issue of demonetisation. He accused the government of implementing it without any concrete planning resulting in hardship to the common man. Kharge also sought to know from the government how much black money has been unearthed post- demonetisation. He also said the government’s move towards leading the country on digital transaction is not practical as all people are neither educated nor have smartphones. The members of various political parties also participated in the discussion.
