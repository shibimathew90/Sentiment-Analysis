0,"Yes. And that is why I am not sure why BJP (as a political party) is pursuing it. It is against their political interests to pursue GST. 

Congress is not going to block GST past 2016. In fact, if I was Sonia Gandhi I would want GST to be passed and implemented by 2017. That will ensure that Modi bears the full brunt of it in 2019. 

Had BJP envisaged that they would win 2014, they would have tried to get it passed under Congress regime, but BJP was busy with the NaMo-Advani tussle at that time. 

I don't see how passing GST is going to be helpful to BJP now. Had they passed it in 2014 - Ok. But now it is going to be pretty bad for them. 

Of course, I am talking all about this from a political perspective. Not like OP - since unless someone is planning to leave India in 3-5 years, they will face the GST brunt sooner or later. And as an end consumer I would prefer to face it sooner than later.

2,"&gt; he should appear in news only as frequently as KRK does

I am sorry to write this but your comparison of KRK with Swamy shows the lack of understanding of basic comparison.

From what I read of Swamy, he is a maverick politician. He could have easily been the PM but the country wants Raga and AK types. Now we have Namo but randia is full of people who dont like NaMo as if some randians are Einsteins themselves.

He campaigned to pull the ABV gov down and hence the tarnishing article on ABV supporters such as RSS.

Everyone should get their dues, whether for good or bad. He has the qualification/guts to be there.

&gt;* Raghuram Rajan's announcement that he would return to academia in September and India's failure to make it into the Nuclear Suppliers Group at the Seoul meeting last week were both perfectly understandable outcomes that shouldn't have brought too much disappointment for the government.

&gt;* Consider Rajan: While it is true that many of his supporters were quite public in calling for the Reserve Bank of India governor to be given a second term, the loudest voices in the fray were that of Bharatiya Janata Party Member of Parliament Subramanian Swamy and his digital army.

&gt;* Shunting out a Congress appointee and playing second-fiddle to China should not come as surprises, yet for the jingoistic NaMo army it turned into the victory of removing an American agent and the defeat of not being able to stare down the Chinese.
