1,"Yes definitely. Upa cabinet was much better than the current NDA cabinet. It's with the dynastical leadership that I have qualms with. People have chosen bjp predominantly for its leader(NaMo) and rejected the Congress for a similar reason. As they say, ""An army of sheep lead by a lion is better than an army of lions lead by a sheep"".",2016-05-22 12:00:44
2,"I meant that there were much more experienced people capable of doing better. The leader brings out the best(or in this case worst)  in his/her team. The best example as i said earlier is NaMo. Though without the experienced members of the earlier NDA ministries, he has achieved a good governance by leading by example. I feel that if UPA cabinet had a more decisive leader, they would have been productive too. About scams, too early to comment about this NDA. ",2016-05-22 20:30:08
3,"No. That is acting. Don't forget she was an actor. Falling on her feet is expected by her. There are a few ppl who postulate that she gets women voters to vote for her precisely due to this subjugation of men. 

Only thing is that news is constantly leaked that ""Amma doesn't like falling on feet culture"" just like ""sonia unhappy"" or ""namo unhappy"" stories. These sort of things are only for middle class consumption and should be taken with a pinch of salt. ",2016-05-24 09:36:33
4,Is that you Rahul? Why do you C0ngress apologetic folks always target the tea selling background of NaMo? Wtf? ,2016-05-25 12:05:56
5,"I am syaing ak is same as namo. Both un trustworthy. 
People should be critical on both not just one! ",2016-05-26 19:18:18
6,"&gt; 1.either frivolously or without knowing the full facts of the case. 

What is this? a Joke? Have a look at Modi's speeches, he is crass and spews venom. Without a doubt its his super loud crass mouth.

&gt;2. Modi becomes PM and has full intention to put the marines in jail. Babus and Lawyers tell him that it's not possible.
 Nice fantasy. Make for good namo fapping sesh. Full intention? Before the elections he had many ""intentions"" how many did were full and how many were stopped by babus and lawyers? Pathetic. 

&gt;3.Modi is the PM and now knows that the grass is of a different color on this side and the central government has limitations in this case. 

What was he earlier? He was not at all privy to how the government works? for fucks sake he was a CM for consecutive terms or are you implying he is as dumb as he sounds? or do you have a problem with comprehension?

&gt;4. He has been told one of the three things (a) UPA messed up the case (b) Italians outplayed India using the international law and tribunal to their advantage and we have been cornered or (c) we never had a case but Soniaji was too cautious/scared because they were Italians and decided to jail them. 

He has been ""told"". What kind of BS is this? He told him to say 56"" and all that crass crap? He has not fulfilled a single promise from the manifesto. ""Told"" how innocent is this genocidal fascists is in peoples fantasies. 

&gt;5. Government realizes that we can't be stubborn and openly disregard international laws and tribunals. 

Maturing now. Finally bachha bada ho raha hai.

&gt;6.Government finds a way-out and does not object to release of the first marine in 2014. There is no deal with Italy.

What way out?

&gt;7.Government does not object to the release of the second marine on the similar lines in 2016. There is no deal with Italy. 

Pussyholed again.

&gt;8.Things get connected to Augusta, without any merit, because Italians keep fucking up things for India. 

Without any merit? LOL

&gt;9.It's pay back time. Congress and sympathizers get a chance to attack Modi. 

Its his own loud mouth that is catching up with this serial uneducated loud mouthed genocidal dictator of a liar.

&gt;10.In summary, it was a Jumla which misfired. But shit happens. 

Good job genius. Shit happens? This is not the first of shit that happened. In fact this idiot has gone back on all his promises. 

How naive BJP supporters are, full of fantasy. They imagine this to be a movie and modi the star, salman or sharukh ;)

""In summary, it was a Jumla which misfired. But shit happens"" LOLOL Keep smoking brah. I reckon you're mistook some actual dry bull shit for grass.

7,People bored with politics? NaMo and AAP army silent?,2016-06-05 02:04:04
8,"Well you expect politicians to do politics and that's how KCR planned to go on with Telangana movement. KCR is a damn good politician and TRS electoral performance stands as a proof for it. KCR = Namo + Lalu Yadav. You have sectarianism, dynastic-ism and those speeches which bring you votes. You and me might not be impressed but public who vote in large numbers are swayed to vote for them. With the leadership vaccum in Telangana I predict TRS to stay in here atleast for another term.",2016-06-08 14:20:32
9,"&gt; Well you expect politicians to do politics and that's how KCR planned to go on with Telangana movement.

Ah look, when KCR does fucked up things, it is just smart politics.

&gt; KCR is a damn good politician and TRS electoral performance stands as a proof for it.

No, it just shows that there are people like you who like to blame other groups of people for their problems. It just shows that there are stupid people who prefer freebies than to hold politicians accountable.

&gt; KCR = Namo + Lalu Yadav.

Let me fix that for you **KCR's Nose = Namo's chest + Lalu's Ear hair**",2016-06-08 15:38:48
10,You are right. Bakthards can just orgasm looking at namo speech in the US. Osaam. ,2016-06-14 21:37:04
11,"No. No. That's bcoz Rajan has failed and he ain't the good guy everyone is making him out to be. I never said I dislike him, but you all hero worship him too much. Nobody should be hero worshipped like he is. I'd prefer if he is removed from his post and replaced with modi worshipping stooge. Hare krishna. Hare Namo. Peace out.",2016-06-16 09:41:55
12,NaMo Magic? chappan inch ka ____?,2016-06-16 15:45:06
13,"By close of 2018, almost all institutions will be filled with Namo chamchas...Rajan was perhaps the only one that held his position due to his competence and achievements rather than political  backing.
Really angry to see that last popular contrarian voice go.
Since we already have an ineffectual opposition , democracy lies now in absolute tatters. Get ready for an authoritarian and dictatorial govt",2016-06-19 10:54:36
14,"Consider this.   

- Currently manufacturing states get more money than consuming states.   

- Post GST this would be equalised.   

- However, if manufacturing states lose revenue, they are not going to agree.  

- So govt is going to compensate them for their losses for 3-5 years.     

- So consuming states will get more than what they used to get earlier &amp; manufacturing states will get the same as before.   

- Where the fuck is this extra money going to come from?   

- Obviously from us.   

- The rate will be such that it will have to provide more tax revenue than before   

- Ergo, items will be costlier for us.    

- We are going to be butt-fucked for 3-5 years minimum.   

- By the end of 3-5 years we will be used to being butt-fucked.   

- We may even start enjoying it.   

- We can chant Namo, Namo while being butt-fucked.   

Our only hope is Tamil Nadu &amp; also the Congress. Let's hope they carry out their duty.  

I urge our Tamizh friends to write to Amma. If she saves us from GST, I will break 108 coconuts.
