6,"&gt; And rahul gandhi was never a joke
&gt;  It was bjp and its media picking statements out of context and bhakts running a background laugh track like in the comedy shows

There is some truth to both these statements. But altogether, I think it delusional to imagine that Rahul Gandhi was a good leader. We all deserved higher quality leadership from the opposition - left and right wing alike. 

If someone else was allowed to rise up within and lead the Congress, maybe then the left would have won more state elections. RaGa has no record of political victory and as underdog as that may make him seem in the face of the Modi shitwave, it doesn't help any of us that he is a weak politician.

BJP 2019 + Rajya Sabha (soon after) will make the right an unstoppable force. And I will shove a large part of that blame on the shit opposition who could not inspire voters to fight against an empire of lies and hatred. We needed heroes and we got dynastic turd-gobblers. Fuck them all.

8,"&gt;Puja pandals themselves distribute meat to devotees on Navami

Can confirm for both Durga and Kali Puja bhog we get goat, prawn, and rohu (carp) curry. We have distant relatives that are head purohits at kalighat's kalibari so we can actually get our money's worth and the puja donation doesn't get completely wasted. Kali Puja was yesterday.

For both Kali and Durga Puja there are elaborate pandals and for the larger ones there are fairs surrounding them. These fairs naturally have food and it reflects your average Bengali street food diet - fish fry, chicken cutlet, kebabs, chicken and goat meat rolls, 'bread omlette', jhal muri, bhelpuri, ghugni, non-veg momo, and even patties.

Now of course to sattvikvadis even bengali brahmins are equal to untouchables for eating non-veg. In their eyes Bengalis in general are anti-hindu and part of ""West Bangladesh"", only useful for propaganda and crocodile tears involving the partition, Bose and the bengali famine of '43.

10,"We have zero black money and counterfeit currency in India today. The government got a huge windfall from this exercise because no one was able to exchange their black money. Modi then used his clout to pivot the BJP away from the politics of religion by focusing solely on the politics of development. He then grew two extra arms, one of which had a BJP lotus and the other carrying a Sudharshana Chakra, thereby confirming that he was the eleventh Avatar of Vishnu. The Indian subcontinent immediately ceded to him; achieving Akhand Bharat in an instant. He christened it Ramrajya. And it was good. Ramrajya was then attacked by the Avengers on Trump's orders because the US hegemony was under threat from the our superior Vedic culture. Things seemed dire because Modiji had flown to Tajikistan in order to broker a deal for Adani to export Desi Gaumutra^TM to the Central Asian country and the negotiations were taking too much time as the top 289 rappers of Tajikistan had all written odes praising Modiji and the govt insisted that he sit through the whole performance  (replete with 45000 children, 200 goats and 3 penguins) before they signed the deal. In this moment of great National Trepidation, Baba Ramdev stepped in and distracted the Avengers with his beatboxing skills long enough for Modiji to come back and hug each of the Avengers into submission. He then married Scarlett Johansson, changed his name to Ram II and restarted the Ram dynasty which ended up ruling the whole world in an unbroken streak till the eventual heat death of the universe. Because even Vedic culture has to bow down to actual physics.

Modi, 8 Nov 2016.

&gt;Basically if Rafale is consumable, demonetisation is just 10x easier to consume for the average Joe.

It is NOT an easy sell. Congress tried it (along with GST) in Gujarat elections and it did not work (well, only a bit). When one opens mouth on demonetization, BJP politicians will jump-in to make them look bad during election rallies! If there was any electoral gain for congress - it was purely because of GST, because it was introduced newly with an unstable execution.

The average voter does not know the numbers. They do not understand the meaning of the outcome RBI findings or paragraphs of analysis of the affects of demonetization. If a politician has to deliver a lecture on an issue while on stage - just to make sure people understand - he/she is not a good politician.

Rafale issue is easy. It belongs to a category of scam that matches with what people already know about signing deals with third-parties. Politicians taking bribes and etc. It requires no more than keep repeating ""Modi helped Ambani"" again and again. There is no need to explain ""how"".

 'Ram temple, caste supremacy/inferiority, demonizing Indian Muslims, making Pakistan out to be a way bigger enemy than it really is, preaching fascist nationalism and demanding a Hindu Rashtra' 

to

'Zero unemployment, poverty elimination, literacy growth, infrastructure augmentation, pollution eradication, economic/financial/trade revolutions, technological advancement and in general, pushing India forward on the global stage'.

3. **Eighty+ people died** during this meaningless and futile exercise. They didn't ""die for their country"". They didn't ""sacrifice"" their life for some ""greater cause"". **They had no choice.** If someone you loved had died, you'd understand their pain.

4. The economic havoc that Demonetisation has caused is much, much more than any benefit we might get from it so far. **Millions of us suffered, 5+ million lost their jobs and probably are still suffering, SME industries are still suffering, the GDP has tanked by 2+ %** and it has wiped billions of rupees from our economy and we will continue to suffer due to this for some time now.

5. All the money we have theoretically recovered - around Rs. 10,000+ crore in black money not deposited - has already been lost because **we had to spend 21,000 crore to print the new notes.**

What IAM still confused is if these so called gonna agency is basically a lead generating website and PSU banks are offering the credit and handling the debit then who is paying for that 2% lower interest? Someone has to pay that. What I was afraid was this could also be a dick move by modi to decrease the interest rate without RBI doing so, thus essentially undercutting the rbi power of controlloing interest and thus the amount of credit in the market.

&gt;is Rahul Gandhi supposed to woo the religious voters with Enlightenment values? Let's assume he ran your ideal campaign what proportion of votes do you think the Congress would get in India with that sort of campaign? I would love to hear your analysis of that.

I am not saying anything about how he should run his campaign, he can do whatever the hell he wants. I am saying why blame the other side for his political tactics as the OP has done? The OP said that Rahul started going to temples because he was made to realize it works by the 'hindutvavaadis', I say if OP thinks that's a bad thing to do, blame it on Rahul himself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is there some magical hidden enclave of ultra liberal voters somewhere who outnumber regular people in every constituency (or atleast 272 constituencies) that can magically give Congress the majority they need to tackle the BJP hate machine in a country where it's acceptable for CM to have a history where folks in his rallies make speeches about digging up dead Muslim women and raping them?

You're picking a side, I'm not. You want congress to win over BJP for the reasons you mention, I say good, you chose your side based on what's important to you. I'm saying it doesn't matter which side you pick, if you think something is wrong on principle, then it is equally wrong for your side as well as your opponents. My argument to a 'hindutvavaadi' as OP calls them would be exactly the same if you substitute temple with mosque and Rahul with Modi. If a 'hindutvavaadi' defends Modi when he goes to a mosque saying he had to do it because Rahul made Modi realize Muslim vote bank works, I would still point out the exact same kind of hypocrisy. 

It is this context in which I am equating them, my point has nothing to do with what you mention as BJPs faults or Congress's faults, it is strictly about asking the OP to be consistent about the way he criticizes across the political spectrum.

151,"&gt;The only difference was the economic policies pursued.

I agree. But that statement also implies that a coalition govt that pursues good economic policies can lead to  a  better economy than a majority govt that pursues bad economic policies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Coalition govts are weak, they lack the flexibility and political capital to pull off anything remotely significant

Both UPA I and UPA 2 were coalition governments that can be described as dominated by one party but coalitions nevertheless. There was even coalition instability due to the nuclear agreement when CPM dropped out. Nonetheless, they kept [GDP growth high](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/gdp-surprise-indian-economy-clocked-over-10-growth-in-these-2-years-of-upa-government-shows-new-data/1283928/)  (despite the 2007-2008 terror crises followed by the 2008 global financial crisis) and managed [steepest fall in poverty rates](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cea-arvind-subramanian-reviews-oneyear-of-modi-govt/article7247733.ece). NREGA and RTI were game changing pro-people social and economic legislations, and even today I find it difficult to believe a coalition managed to envision and legislate them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When we finally liberalized the economy we did it cause we had to, not  because PVs coalition govt came up with some brilliant idea that no one  else had come up with before

That trivializes many interactions and decisions that happened to lead to that path. They could have barked up many other paths. An impulsive ""strongman"" might have overridden everybody to gain some showmanship. Thankfully, there was no such impulsive strongman, only a decisive manager. Experts and intellectuals were listened to, allowed to sculpt a common vision and a practical policy over months, and everybody stuck to that vision for years, including the coalitions that succeeded them. Teamwork at its finest.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my ""wolves"" and ""sheep"" analogy, I think we should always be evaluating two questions:

\- are the social costs outweighing any economic good

and

\- are the metrics of economic good actually translating into social and quality of life improvements at the ground level

But it is also true that many of the claims in this regard have been false. That's the main point of contention. I love it whenever the country does well. But it absolutely pisses me off when a lot of the claimed development is lies.

People aren't looking to be negative. They are upset ki many of the claims (not just in terms of sanitation, but in other fields) are fabrications, and it appears that for a lot of people, this false optimism is enough in lieu of actual progress. That's the real frustration for me atleast.

Let's take Adani as an example. By most metrics, it is a company sitting on a mountain of debt. Several independent observers, be it banks, investment firms like Temasek (Singapore govt investment) or even Susu Swamy have been shocked by how unsustainable their debt is. Most Indian and global banks refused to bankroll their Carmichael mine. SBI agreed but backed out. Several local Australian banks also did so.

Let's take one of its subsidiaries.

Adani Power - its signature power plant in Mundra did not generate power from Jan-June 2018 as the coal shortage was at its peak. Several power plants of the company declared bankruptcy and forced Discoms to give it higher rates for purchasing electricity than was agreed upon in the initial PPA. This higher cost is eventually passed on to the consumers.

Its brazenness in the face of environmental regulations has damaged the Kutch coastal areas severely, be it fishing or fly ash deposits ruining agriculture. It also runs on coal which is mined in very controversial ways, most notably the (proposed) Carmichael mines of Australia. Read up on those if you're not familiar with them. There are several incidents in Chattisgarh as well.

And the Mundra SEZ land was given to Adani at throwaway prices by then CM of Gujarat Modi. Some of this land was sold off by Adani to ONGC for ~100 times the price!

195,"&gt;Disagreements over HAL's labour costs were one of the main reasons for collapse of the old deal, but lets ignore that for now.

They had a worksheet agreement in 2015 before PM Modi's visit as confirmed by the  Dassault CEO in his interview 


&gt;Ah-ha, here comes the kicker. He's taking the price from a 2008 bid, representing it as 2012 price and on top of that he's not even considering inflation. Inflation is quite important here, as Dassault's bid included a fixed inflation of 3.9% p.a. 3.9% over 8 years would have resulted in a 35.8% increase in price. Government's claims of lower price in the 2016 deal includes savings from a different formula for inflation that used market inflation with a cap of 3.5%.

Why doesn't the government show the costs then ?   What is it they are hiding ?
What happened to Nirmala Sitaraman's offer of a white paper ?

&gt;This argument was offered as Rahul Gandhi was comparing the bare price of aircraft with price of aircraft and associated add-ons. You can't start with a new price and then berate the old arguments.

The link you shared shows Rahul Gandhi stating the price of a Rafale from 520-700 croress . Where did it  now turn into the base cost of an aircraft that the people who defend Rafale keep on spouting ?


&gt;The RFP might've included a HMD but that doesn't make this an apples-to-apples comparison. The Rafale did not have any HMD integrated with it until we paid for an Israeli HMD to be integrated in 2016. It was even a sticking point during negotiations. If you think that the French would have stuck to their bid price estimation of future integration of a weapon system, you need a lesson in history.


Do you read what you copy paste ? Are you saying India would have brought a 4th generation fighter plane without an Helmet Mounted display ? You are just adding things to somehow  justify the inflated cost the Modi Government paid.

&gt;Seriously? He's going to use a completely different aircraft developed in a completely different industrial ecosystem as a benchmark? Even if you accept that, since he has proven to be incapable to handling simple inflation, it is obvious that he'd not be able to handle the much more complex inflation calculations for Su-30MKI, which involves comparison of 1996 contract price with HAL prices spread over several years.

Yep a defence expert knows nothing about cost of manufacture now .  It doesn't need 1996 prices as a benchmark. HAL could manufacture a new Sukhoi for 450 crores five years ago and that includes the cost of the engine that is 270 -280 crore since that contract is null and void .


&gt;Now he come up with another misdirection. In April 2015, Modi simply announced the procurement, which took over a year to negotiate and was finally signed in September 2016. He's comparing a hypothetical delivery timeline that starts at April 2015 with one that starts in September 2016. Of course, there'd be differences in delivery timelines especially when Qatar signed a deal in May 2015, putting them ahead of us in the delivery queue. He seems to have conveniently ignored all the intractable differences that caused the original deal to collapse. They can't be just wished away to get a result that you want.

See this gives your game away. HAL and Dassault have stated on record that a workshare agreement was done before Modi visited France. 
The second bone of contention that Dassault will not guarantee the work done by HAL wasn't that big of an issue like you want to highlight . When India brought Mirage 2000's from France , HAl guaranteed every plane it made , Dassault did not and there was no problem then. There was no intractable differences that caused the deal to collapse.

Perhaps you need work on your reading comprehension skills. The point was simple: there was no HMD integrated into the Rafale in 2008 which meant that the price was an optimistic estimate that's open to negotiation. UPA had allowed the French to shark us over Scorpene and it would have continued in Rafale too when the bid price would be negotiated.

&gt;Yep a defence expert knows nothing about cost of manufacture now

Appeal to authority? Try again.

&gt;HAL and Dassault have stated on record that a workshare agreement was done before Modi visited France.

Repeat of playbook point number 2.

&gt;The second bone of contention that Dassault will not guarantee the work done by HAL wasn't that big of an issue like you want to highlight .

Of course, no big deal. That's why it came up in [April 2013](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-rafale-deal/governments-15-billion-rafale-deal-faces-delays-sources-idINDEE93403Z20130405) and was not resolved in [even in 2015](http://aviationweek.com/defense/france-india-disagree-over-key-rafale-contract-issue).

&gt;When India brought Mirage 2000's from France , HAl guaranteed every plane it made , Dassault did not and there was no problem then.

What? HAL guaranteed a plane that they didn't even manufacture? Anyway, the problem was that Dassault did not want to guarantee the planes and disagreed with MoD that it was an RFP requirement. In Trappier's eyes, MoD had to just agree with Dassault's interpretation of RFP requirements and accept the higher price of manufacture from HAL despite that changing the determination of lowest bidder. Perhaps he considered these minor issues, but it clearly wasn't for India.

210,"You make some good points without any ideological bent, I appreciate that.

&gt;I agree. But that statement also implies that a coalition govt that pursues good economic policies can lead to a better economy than a majority govt that pursues bad economic policies.

This is essentially you agreeing with me, the economic policies that a govt implements has nothing to do with the whether it's a coalition or a majority based one. They're simply orthogonal, so the economic policies being equal, I would prefer a majority govt instead of a coalition, simply because they won't have all the drawbacks I mention above. The author's position of linking good economic policies with coalitions is a meaningless one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Both UPA I and UPA 2 were coalition governments that can be described as ~~dominated by one party~~ lead by one party (""dominated"" is probably wrong because congress was nowhere near house majority in either term, unlike the current government which is also a coalition in name but has near majority for one party) but were coalitions nevertheless. There was even coalition instability due to the nuclear agreement when CPM dropped out. Nonetheless, they kept [GDP growth high](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/gdp-surprise-indian-economy-clocked-over-10-growth-in-these-2-years-of-upa-government-shows-new-data/1283928/) (despite the 2007-2008 terror crises followed by the 2008 global financial crisis) and managed [steepest fall in poverty rates](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cea-arvind-subramanian-reviews-oneyear-of-modi-govt/article7247733.ece). NREGA and RTI were game changing pro-people social and economic legislations, and even today I find it difficult to believe a coalition managed to envision and legislate them.

This is where I agree with some of your observations, but disagree with your analysis of what's caused them. There's a well-known phrase in the markets that says ""Never mistake brilliance with a bull market"", and I think a version of that applies here. There are two key points to keep in mind. 

1. The entire world enjoyed a solid unabated growth in their wealth during late 90s to 2008. 
2. Economic indicators of good/bad governance are lagging, sometimes a few years, sometimes a few decades. This is simply because these systems are complex with millions of individual actors. For example, under Bill Clinton in 1995 the americans changed the rules of housing loans, they gave several incentives to people from deprived areas ranging from zero-down payment loans, 3% rates etc.., the incentive system for banks were changed, rating agencies were strong armed. It took about 13-15 years for these policy failures to manifest in the form of the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. 

So, how much of the GDP growth from late 90s to 2008 is because of UPA, is debatable, it is also debatable if the growth would've been even higher if they weren't managing the economy. We also cannot say for sure if this whole thing is a trend from PVs time, or how much impact ABVs govt had. 

NREGA, I don't think it's a good legislation in the long-term, it provides security in the short term and that's a good thing, but I can't say I would agree with it being a total game-changer. 

RTI was handled well, I agree with that, UPA should get credit for it. 

But then again, the twin-balance sheet issues we're facing and the linked high NPA issues with PSU Banks are some of the issues whose roots were laid under the UPA-I govt. 

&gt;That trivializes the many interactions, inevitable conflicts of opinions, and decisions that were necessary to lead to that path. They could have barked up many other bad paths. An impulsive ""strongman"" might have overridden everybody to gain some showmanship. Thankfully, there was no such impulsive strongman, only a decisive political manager in the form of PVN who listened to his policy and regulatory experts. Experts and intellectuals were listened to, allowed to sculpt a common vision and a practical policy over months, and everybody stuck to that vision for years, including the coalitions that succeeded them. Teamwork at its finest.

You left out one important tail I wrote in my reply ""although he should get the credit for actually implementing it well"". I was referring to PVs ability to work with very limited political capital, yet accomplish a very difficult task, I also talked about PV a bit in my reply and why he was very well suited to be PM in those conditions. But I also stand-by my statement that PV is an anomaly and an exception to the rule, I don't see anyone in Congress or one of the other local parties who has anywhere near the skills or aptitude that PV had. I'll say one fact about PV that should give you an idea of his aptitude, he was 65 when he leant to program computers because he thought it was interesting and Rajiv at the time was very into the budding Information Technology industry and he wanted to get close to him. 

&gt;As for my ""wolves"" and ""sheep"" analogy, I think we should always be evaluating two questions

I understand what you mean by wolves and sheep, but it's not well suited here. They're no wolves and we're no sheep, they do what they need to, to get what they desire which is political power, just like us they're responding to incentives. It's up to us to provide the proper incentives for them through voting, when enough of us look at issues fairly and vote according to what we want, they'll work in a way we want. I believe this is the simplest and most useful way to look at politics and elections, not ideologies.

&gt;\- are the social costs outweighing any economic good

No, economic prosperity wipes out any concerns you may have about social costs in a long enough time frame, like I said above, politicians do what they think will make them win, and that changes with time. Social issues can only be tackled with a good level of economic prosperity, it's like Maslow's hierarchy, you can look around the world and see which countries are working on social problems and which are working on more lower level problems. It's a process. You can't expect India to jump to USA's level in a few decades.

&gt;\- are the metrics of economic good actually translating into social and quality of life improvements at the ground level

Yes, but it's not a linear process where everyone grows at the same rate. It's not at all like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, it's the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting richer too, but the rich are getting richer faster. Inequality will increase during a high growth phase like ours, but inequality doesn't paint the whole picture. We have lifted several hundred millions out of poverty in the last few decades, so who cares if the inequality increased and some got even richer? It will even out with time and even if it doesn't I don't think it's a big issue. The only time that everyone was equal was under the USSR where everyone was poor.",2018-11-10 17:34:54

Why wasn't full transfer of technology taken in the new deal? (This is speculation so feel free since we haven't seen the documents  )
Why did Hollande say Modi brought Ambani into the deal and Dassault had no choice ?

95% completed means it was nearly finalized. Why did Modi suddenly renegotiate for 36 jets which took the French Government and Dassault by surprise and this is on record ?

I would like to to see how much my tax money the government spent to build INS Arihant. I'd also like to see how much it is spending to manufacture Agni missiles, the breakdown of costs for C-17 deal, C-130J deal, Apache AH-64E deal and Boeing Chinook deal. Are we done comparing our wishlists now?

&gt;Are you telling me that there wasn't an Helmet Mounted display in a 4th generation Aircraft ?

Yes. Rafale does not have a HMD integrated with it. If you'd taken the effort to read the article that I'd linked in my first comment, you'd realize that. But no, you're content with demanding higher standards of proof while presenting your disbelief as proof for your claims.

&gt;If there was such a problem with Dassault why didn't the Government consider the Eurofighter which was available at a 20 % discount ?

Already answered in one of the articles that I'd linked before. [CVC guidelines prevent negotiations with second lowest bidder.](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rafale-fighter-jet-deal-modi-government-rahul-gandhi-congress-5082298/) They had already negotiated quite a bit with Dassault on Rafale and wanted to proceed on that for quick procurement.

&gt;Why wasn't full transfer of technology taken in the new deal?

It was a stop-gap emergency procurement, not a full replacement for MMRCA. License manufacture for 36 aircraft is not financially feasible. [They decided to allocate 30% of offsets for DRDO programs, ensuring that we do get critical technology out of the deal.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-deal-comes-with-50-per-cent-offset-clause/articleshow/54487326.cms)  

&gt;Why did Hollande say Modi brought Ambani into the deal and Dassault had no choice ?

No, he said that the French government had no choice, and later clarified that only [Dassault will be able to answer for Reliance's involvement](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/hollande-fuels-rafale-fighter-jet-controversy-india-172155091--finance.html). Considering that he originally made that comment when he was accused of 
favouring Reliance, his statements are not above scrutiny.

&gt;Why did Modi suddenly renegotiate for 36 jets which took the French Government and Dassault by surprise and this is on record ?

Once again, because of irreconcilable differences in the original agreement. NDA chose to structure the new procurement as an immediate purchase of 36 aircraft (as a fresh competitive procurement always takes years if not decades) to be followed by a [competitive procurement for 110 aircraft](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/india-re-opens-competition-to-supply-110-fighters-447392/). This was done after [prior consultation with IAF](http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/oct/03/iaf-chief-bs-dhanoa-defends-rafale-again-says-dassault-not-government-chose-reliance-as-a-partner-1880623.html).

Else it will be terrible for cogency of Indian Govt's word.


&gt; The other option was to complete the previous deal


Well, IIRC it was DA that backed off from previous deal. There excuse was something like that the tender process took so long, inflation increased or so and they wanted to increase the price. But previous govt wanted to hold DA true to their initial EoI. That was a Log Jam. And also there was a flip flop on critical ToT to HAL. So previous deal is not an option anymore.

SchumpeterIndia‚Äôs banking system is flirting with a Lehman moment

The collapse of a shadow bank has sparked fear and financial contagion

Ôøº

¬†Print edition¬†| Business

Nov 8th 2018

When narendra modi¬†was elected prime minister of India in 2014, his plan was to revive its¬†gdp¬†growth rate back to the near-double-digit figures seen in the mid-2000s. Few would have guessed that the biggest threat to that goal was the financial industry. For several years state-run banks have failed to get to grips with a $100bn mountain of dud loans. Now panic has seized parts of the privately run system. One bank boss says the situation is as bad as the Asian crisis of 1998 or the global crash of 2008.

In September¬†il&amp;fs, a financial firm that owns and finances roads and power plants, defaulted on some of its $13bn of debt. The contagion has struck India‚Äôs shadow banks, which rely on $250bn-300bn of borrowing to fund themselves. Their market value has collapsed by a median of 40% this year. A bitter row about how to respond has erupted between the government and the Reserve Bank of India (rbi), the largely independent central bank. Over a billion people depend on an emergency being avoided.

India‚Äôs financial system has both Chinese and American characteristics; it faces a blend of a slow-motion banking crisis at government-run lenders, plus a high-speed liquidity run of the kind that hit Wall Street in 2008. That the industry has taken on a hybrid character over time reflects the conflicting aims of the forces that shaped it. The state wants pliant banks, ready to lend to the rural poor and to infrastructure projects, and that will buy government bonds. The¬†rbi¬†emphasises stability, so is paranoid about wheeler-dealers taking risks or ripping off the vulnerable. Entrepreneurs want capital and to start financial-services firms themselves. And consumers want loans and whizzy new banking technologies.

About half the system, measured by loans, consists of state-run banks. They are usually listed but the government appoints their top brass and often influences them to disastrous effect. Another 25% comes from private banks; some of which are among Asia‚Äôs best-run lenders‚Äîhdfc¬†Bank and Kotak trade on about four times their book value, compared with below one times for the zombie state banks. The other quarter is from a motley crew of 50-odd shadow banks that have expanded quickly. They are less heavily regulated and lend in particular areas such as housing. They are usually prohibited from taking deposits so fund themselves with debt. Last, there are innovative digital firms, such as Paytm, a mobile-payments firm. Overall, the system straddles the 19th and 21st centuries, featuring subsiding bank branches protected from the monsoon by tarpaulins, but also virtual mobile chatbots.

The present troubles have their roots in 2005-12, when state banks went on a lending bender, extending credit to dubious tycoons and to infrastructure projects. Net bad debts are 9% of state banks‚Äô loan books. The government has not properly recapitalised these zombies and the flow of credit from them has slowed. Accidents keep happening. In February¬†pnb, the second-biggest state lender, disclosed a $2bn fraud involving diamond merchants.

A second phase began after 2012. Between 2012 and 2017 more capital flowed into India than flowed out. In 2015 interest rates began to fall and in November 2016 the government replaced the stock of bank notes overnight, leading savers to switch from physical money into deposits with banks, and into debt mutual funds. Flush with cash, and with rates low, they looked for ways to lend the money out again and part of the answer was to fund the shadow banks, which went on a binge‚Äîthe top 50 have doubled their debts and assets in the past five years. Perhaps as much as $50bn-100bn of their debts comes due within 12 months.

Borrowing short and lending long is a high-stakes game. After the¬†il&amp;fs¬†collapse, confidence has evaporated. The group has 348 opaque subsidiaries, including India‚Äôs longest tunnel. It has now been taken over by the government, which indirectly owned 40% of it. Mutual funds and banks are reluctant to lend to other shadow banks‚Äîmost report solid capital ratios, but can anyone be sure they do not have time-bombs buried in their balance-sheets? For weeks the shadow banks have faced a liquidity crunch.

They are big enough to damage India‚Äôs entire financial system. Mutual funds, which are sold to the public, have $55bn of exposure to them, or 11% of total assets under management. Conventional banks have loaned $70bn to shadow banks, the equivalent of two-fifths of the former‚Äôs core capital. Among private lenders the mood is already jittery:¬†icici‚Äôs boss has just departed after claims of conflicts of interest (which she denies). Yes Bank is replacing its boss after the¬†rbi¬†refused to approve an extension of his term. Even if a full crisis does not erupt shadow banks may be forced to shrink. When combined with the rotten state banks, that would mean that 75% of India‚Äôs financial system is on crutches.

Bazooka time

A sell-off in global markets could easily trigger a new wave of panic. The government, facing a general election next year, wants the central bank to lend more freely to the shadow banks. But the¬†rbi¬†does not want to reward failure and has so far injected liquidity only indirectly, by buying government bonds and allowing banks to guarantee some new bonds issued by shadow banks. It blames the government for its endless meddling in state-run lenders and for its failure to recapitalise them, despite years of warning signs.

In the short term the government is right‚Äîunless the liquidity squeeze abates soon, the central bank will need to set aside its natural reluctance and act boldly. In the long term the¬†rbi¬†is right. A ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù reform is needed to privatise the state banks and extract them from the government‚Äôs tight grip. India also must end the regulatory arbitrage that allows shadow banks to raise most of their funds from retail investors and deposit-taking banks. Either shadow lenders should come out of the dark and be turned into banks, or a firewall will have to be erected around them to protect the rest of banking. And if India does not get its financial system back on its feet, the economy will not grow fast. It is that simple.

244,"Modi needs some institute to take the blames. That's all. ""According NITI recommendations.."".  Leader loves micromanagement and takes over every institution out there, having taste of power. ",2018-11-10 21:35:49
245,"&gt;They signed it in 2014. I have even linked the article to it. I can't make it any more simpler than this: the workshare agreement is irrelevant as the matters under dispute were not covered by it. That is why there were still reports of disagreements even after it was signed.

That's your assertion.  I have seen you have carefully avoided the questions. There are always disagreements when a deal is signed . You are now stating that there were disagreements beyond the deal . 
Why were Parrikar and Trappier so sure that the deal would be signed just 15 days before Modi's trip .

&gt;95 != 100. If you can't agree on 2 key matters, it doesn't matter that you agree on the rest.

Once again nonsense speculation . If they don't agree on two key matters , the deal is nowhere near done. It's a 50-50 at best .  Why were Parikkar and Trappier so sure the deal would be done 15 days before Modi's visit ?  What changed?

&gt;I would like to to see how much my tax money the government spent to build INS Arihant. I'd also like to see how much it is spending to manufacture Agnimissiles, the breakdown of costs for C-17 deal, C-130J deal, Apache AH-64E deal and Boeing Chinook deal. Are we done comparing our wishlists now?

Classic whataboutery . The question surrounds the Rafale deal and how Anil Ambani stands to benefit . Why are you bringing in irrelevant things ?

&gt;Yes. Rafale does not have a HMD integrated with it. If you'd taken the effort to read the article that I'd linked in my first comment, you'd realize that. But no, you're content with demanding higher standards of proof while presenting your disbelief as proof for your claims.

If you had taken the time to read other articles except the  slanted ones you link  , you would have known that Rafale comes with a HMD installed from British Aviation but the IAF prefers the Israeli ones.  

&gt;Already answered in one of the articles that I'd linked before. CVC guidelines prevent negotiations with second lowest bidder. They had already negotiated quite a bit with Dassault on Rafale and wanted to proceed on that for quick procurement.

You are now lying out of your ass. When the original deal was scrapped , the tender became invalid and as such with the Eurofighter offerred at a discount it became the lowest bidder. That is according to the Defence Procurement code of 2013. 


&gt;It was a stop-gap emergency procurement, not a full replacement for MMRCA. License manufacture for 36 aircraft is not financially feasible. They decided to allocate 30% of offsets for DRDO programs, ensuring that we do get critical technology out of the deal.

According to their terms of the original agreement 18 Rafales would be delivered within 3 years of the deal being completed and 108 would be made by HAL with full transfer of technology . Here the Rafales will be made by 2022 . How is one an emergency procurement ? The Government likes to use the word Emergency to signal it's haste but a single Rafale hasn't been delivered as yet .

&gt;No, he said that the French government had no choice, and later clarified that only Dassault will be able to answer for Reliance's involvement. Considering that he originally made that comment when he was accused of favouring Reliance, his statements are not above scrutiny.

Yes everybody except Modiji is under scrutiny. He later said that the France government did  not choose Reliance . The Indian Government's assent is required for all offset clauses and as such if Dassault had to do business with India they had to choose Reliance. He didn't go back on his original statement did he ?



&gt;Once again, because of irreconcilable differences in the original agreement. NDA chose to structure the new procurement as an immediate purchase of 36 aircraft (as a fresh competitive procurement always takes years if not decades) to be followed by a competitive procurement for 110 aircraft. This was done after prior consultation with IAF.

You are keeping on repeating the lie. How do irreconcilable differences crop up when Parrikar and The CEO of Dassault said the deal is close to completion 15 days before Modi made the trip ? 
There are many reports about how Parrikar did not know the deal that was renegotiated . 
There is a section in the Defence Procurement code for Emergency purchases which negates the requirement of offset clauses altogether provided the product is delivered as soon as possible .

You do know that if the IAF chief disagrees with the Government of the day , it's technically treason right ?

Once again legally if the negotiations with Dassault break down a new tender must be floated. If that is not done and a company with no experience in avionics is inserted into the offsets with an inflated cost . There are bound to be questions asked .

260,"&gt; whatever happened to years of nurturing these various OFBs?

Most of the problems you have mentioned or highlighted were exacerbated due to non-congress governments, their inexperience and their lack of foresight in following Congress policies on defence preparedness due to petty politics. 

Whether it is the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program, the Light Combat Aircraft project or the Advanced Technology Vessel - all these inidigenisation efforts were launched by the Congress.

&gt; Last MMRCA was bought way back in 70s, after that?

You forget that the UPA government initiated the process during its last term? In fact, if our coruupt BJP PM Narendra Modi had not sabotaged it, the original Rafale deal would have further boosted our indigenisation efforts, in the field of defence aviation, due to technology transfer agreements in the contract.

Whether it was the leasing of nuclear submarines or even purchase and retrofitting of the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorkhov (now INS Vikramaditya), all foreign defence purchase by the Congress have focused on developing a strategic relationship and / or boosting our own indigenisation efforts. (That is why today we are able to build are own nuclear submarines and aircraft carrier).

Ever non-congress government sets India back by a few years because of their inexperience in various areas. Some, like the present Modi government set us back by decades because petty egos and arrogance to not listen to the advise Congress sincerely offers - whether it is in fireign relations or defence, based on its years of experience. (In that, I truly appreciate the NDA run by Vajpayee as he did make an effort to listen to the Congress and even took up their offers of help e.g. for diplomacy).",2018-11-11 04:36:33

&gt;Furthermore,¬†Defence‚ÄìAerospace, a respected French defence news website¬†reported¬†on March 11, quoting Eric Trappier: ‚ÄúNow, there will be a shared warranty as each partner will be responsible for its own work, Trappier told reporters here, ‚Äúand HAL will provide warranties for its own work.‚Äù

&gt; This was in light of disagreements over product responsibility and liability. The Indian government has been insisting that Dassault take responsibility for the aircraft assembled by HAL, over which it had no control, and both sides had been wrangling over this point for the better part of two years.


&gt;The¬†Defence-Aerospace¬†article further adds: ‚ÄúThis is the same warranty arrangement that is currently in force for the two companies‚Äô work on the ongoing upgrade of India‚Äôs fleet of Mirage 2000H fighters, and it is not clear why it was not adopted from the start.‚Äù

Once again you are stating falsehoods saying there were irreconcilable differences when the same deal that HAL takes responsibility for the jets it manufactures has been there since the Mirage 2000's and a workshare agreement was already worked out .

Just admit you were caught lying and move on .",2018-11-11 10:48:02

268,"There are two types of people. First type is open minded and never fixated. Second type already has a programmed mind and is not trained to think on its own. The second type will always find fault in the opposition no matter what is done, and they will never doubt their leader. 

Modi depends on the second type to vote for him. They are sheep and can easily be controlled. They cannot think for themselves .

269,"Then you are woefully misinformed. It's quite easy to know what relationships we have with other nations, a quick Google search will do, and we have not made substantiative inroads in bilateral agreements or economic ties. We aren't France making stops at all it's ex-colonies to remind their local strong man/dictator that we control their banking system. Modis visits have amounted to spent revenue, and precious little else. There is no way we can counter the start the Chinese have made with OBOR, and their other infrastructure projects. Infact, their only real counter has been to try and strengthen ties with the US, hardly the defiance you seem you think he has. Our position with and relations to our neighbors have deteriorated, opportunities have been utterly squandered. 

This is the best description of the government's Foriegn policy I've seen yet. ""Modi is like a stylish batsman of whom much is expected but who consistently fails to deliver big scores. Four years on, he‚Äôs put far too few runs on the board while Xi‚Äôs been on a century spree.""

270,"&gt;Sigh, its just blind leading the blind. It doesn't matter what Dassault and HAL agreed on regarding warranties if it doesn't have MoD approval. MoD's position has been clear since the beginning - Dassault has to warranty the entire aircraft made by HAL. Since you seem to be incapable of reading the articles I link, here is an excerpt:

I quoted respected aviation sites and you keep on quoting AviationWeekly . I like how you insert Nikhil Gokhale's book when everything else fails.

&gt;A clarification was sought from Dassault Aviation towards confirmation of compliance to the terms of the RFP and terms of the bid submitted by them specifically. The two crucial points, i.e. (i) the consolidated Man Hours (MH) based on which Dassault Aviation had been declared L-1 would be the same man hours required for license manufacture of 108 Rafale aircraft in India, and (ii) Dassault Aviation as the Seller under the contract for 126 aircraft for the IAF will undertake necessary contractual obligations as per RFP requirements.

&gt;The representatives of Dassault Aviation reiterated their stand on both issues and stated that while Dassault Aviation will be responsible only for delivery of 18 aircraft in a flyaway condition, they will not take ownership for the 108 aircraft to be manufactured by HAL as the Local Production Agency (LPA).

So a  Right wing journalist known to be quite close to Modi writes a book  . No sources are mentioned , I see that people who defend the Rafale deal resort to Nitin Gokhale's book because the things he spouts can't be verified anywhere else. Provide a white paper of the negotiations if the government is so interested in transparency as it claims .

Pardon me if I take the CEO of Dassault and an ex chairman of HAL to be more knowledgeable on the subject and give their quotes more weight age than Nitin Gokhale.  Here are the facts that can be verified as it stands -:

1. A workshare agreement was signed by both HAL and Dassault .
2. The CEO of Dassault has been quoted as saying that HAL has agreed to guarantee the plane it builds as it did during the Mirage 2000's deal .

The rest is unsubstantiated speculation. Nitin Gokhale doesn't reveal his sources in his  book.  No quotes are given just a portrait painted that puts the NDA government in a flattering light .
",2018-11-11 11:41:21
271,"No erroneous details have been pointed out . I attacked Nikhil Gokhale , I said a French aviation website would know a lot more about Dassault than Aviation Week. Similarly I expect the Indian Express to know a lot more about India than the New York Post but carry on with your straw man arguments like usual . You once again reitiriated falsehoods where the additional reporting from French websites contradicted what was reported earlier but you are going with the same story again and again . 

To repeat easily verifiable info 

1. 15 days before Modi made the visit ... Trappier says the deal is 95 % complete . 26 days before Modi's visit , Trappier says the deal iwith HaL is complete and HAL will take guarantee of the Rafales it built .

2. Parrikar says the deal is nearly completed , Ten days before Modi's visit 

3. Trappier claims that the deal for 36 jets came from out of the blue and that they were still negotiating with HAL.

The article you linked to is of February 2015 where it's mentioned that there are some problems with HAL , the Time Trappier made the quote that HAL will guarantee the planes it will make  is from March 2015 .  Couldn't negotiations have been done in the interim ? 
Are you being so willingly blind ?

Sangh Parivar role in politically motivated murders and riots.

Posioning of the countries discourse. 

&gt;During the outbreak of violence in Gujarat in February 2002, many of the victims were burned alive or dismembered while police and¬†BJP¬†state government authorities either stood by or joined in. The mobs had with them lists of homes and businesses owned by Muslims, lists that they could have acquired only from government sources.

&gt;After the massacre, state¬†BJP¬†officials also impeded the investigation. In the high-profile ‚ÄúBest Bakery Case,‚Äù a judge dismissed charges against twenty-one defendants on trial for setting fire to a Muslim-owned bakery and killing and injuring its owners because the main witness, a nineteen-year-old girl, stated that she could not identify any of the attackers. She later told the press that ‚Äúshe testified falsely after local Hindu politicians repeatedly threatened her family ‚Ä¶ and after concluding that prosecutors, who made no effort to meet with her before the trial, were not serious about gaining convictions.‚Äù On September 12, 2003, the Chief Justice of India‚Äôs Supreme Court expressed his disgust with the situation by declaring publicly that he has ‚Äúno faith left in the prosecution and the Gujarat government.‚Äù

&gt;Following the violence, Gujarat‚Äôs Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, a¬†BJP¬†member, called upon his supporters to ‚Äúteach a lesson‚Äù to those who ‚Äúbelieve in multiplying the population,‚Äù referring to Muslims. Other Sangh Parivar officials were even more explicitly threatening.¬†VHP¬†International President Ashok Singhal described the Gujarat carnage as a ‚Äúsuccessful experiment‚Äù and warned that it would be repeated all over India. After the December 2002¬†BJPelection victory in Gujarat,¬†VHP¬†General Secretary Pravin Togadia declared, ‚ÄúAll Hindutva opponents will get the death sentence, and we will leave this to the people to carry out. The process of forming a Hindu rule in the country has begun with Gujarat, and¬†VHP¬†will take the Gujarat experiment to every nook and corner of the country.‚Äù

&gt;At the national level the¬†BJP¬†advances the ideology of Hindutva through propaganda, the manipulation of cultural institutions, undercutting laws that protect religious minorities, and minimizing or excusing Hindu extremist violence.

Back then... it was needed. We were severely lagging in food production and caught up in the middle of ""West vs Soviets"". Non Aligned policy was only on papers and we already had embargoes imposed on us by the USA during IG's government, leading to decades of running on outdated technologies.

Today, economy has opened up and more or less each state is more than capable of specializing in an aspect of national development ( not that the locally elected political scum would allow anything like that ) 

What RRR is saying that Modi has openly lied, when he was screaming ""Minimum Governance"" since day 0 of election till date. NDA-DeMo ( there have been more before ) is a big example of how a government's involvement in a system that was designed to be independent can wreak havoc on state level. Piss poor implementation of GST ( although very much welcomed and pending for some time ) with no prior research on tax flows for essential commodities is another example as to how centralized policies stunted growth. Aadhaar shoving up every service is another prime example of how a centralized identity scheme without any due and proper input from industry and public  basically led to instances of starvation, identity theft and money ( since the government is more interested in pushing schemes than fixing core underlying problems, almost like adding another layer to a road without cleaning the base )

303,"While I agree with a lot of points set out by the promoters of free market economics, I feel they ignore the realities on the ground. A free market works best when entry and exit barriers are reduced and there is minimal information dissymmetry.



In the Indian context, thanks to the overwhelming interaction between social and economic factors, this is difficult to achieve.


It is also important to note that while India is rich in many resources, there is a lot of inequality in distribution. This was more so the case at the time of independence, with Zamindari dominating the economics of the nation. 


I believe that Keynesian Economics is the future and that privitization is important. But two factors to note:

1. It would be wrong to evaluate past decisions under current economic criteria. Socialism, especially Hadrian Socialism, was the need of the day at independence.


2. While free markets certainly sounds great in principle, people often ignore the conditions that are required for its success and focus on fighting government control. This is misguided. 


I believe that the way to move forward isn't to act like theoreticians but instead achieve a balance. 


We must ensure that agility is the thing that defines our nation, not strict adherence to mere ideology.

I think, though, that in an ideal world politicians would stay away from religion altogether. Or if they practice it, to keep it a private thing. Certainly not publish books about it. He could very well have written this after retiring. 

&gt; One can prefer and assert the intellectual superiority of the teachings of one faith over another. 

That‚Äôs all well and good, but how does that work exactly? In Indonesia, for example, a chinese-ethnic christian man called Ahok was removed from his seat as governor of Jakarta because of an allegation of blasphemy. And that incident too was about one group of people asserting the intellectual superiority of one religion over another.

Surely the ""ideal world"" tilts towards more freedom and openness and strict political neutrality? 

For me Shashi Tharoor or Modi or Adityanath or Manmohan Singh has every right to propagate (and it is a constitutionally protected right) their religious belief that beef eating is bad for you in whatever vague moral sense they wish -- *as long as they do not require people of other faiths or belief systems to stop eating beef because it causes offence to them*.

364,"&gt;So, this is not about social media in general but specifically how negative Twitter is?
Yes, it has enabled a perfect ecosystem for hate. **I get messages or tweets that use unambiguously abusive words such as ‚Äúslut‚Äù or ‚Äúbitch‚Äù. Even when you report that, Twitter does not take action. Instead, they will simply send you an email saying, ‚ÄúOh well, our team did not find it abusive.‚Äù** So that‚Äôs the kind of response they give.

&gt;You think Twitter has completely failed in taking action?
Yes. This is a very abusive relationship. It‚Äôs like if a woman‚Äôs husband beats her every day but he‚Äôs very rich so she has to stick with the marriage. And Twitter knows this. They know this is their business model: even though we are abusive, even though we don‚Äôt do anything, we are a necessary evil. I have four lakh followers on Twitter, so I know what I am leaving. But someone needs to make the point that this isn‚Äôt normal. Twitter is bad not just for me, it‚Äôs bad for democracy. It is creating polarisation that wasn‚Äôt there. And there are structural reasons for this. **For example, Twitter works very closely with the government and has been verifying the handles of right-wing [Hindutva] hate mongers. Twitter India has become embedded in the right-wing and the ruling party ecosystem.** That, however, is not the case in the United States. There, Twitter actually suspends the accounts of White supremacists who are abusive. So, in the US, their policy is entirely different. But in India, it is this ‚Äúchalta hai‚Äù [that‚Äôs the way it is] attitude. Because of this, no one really flags abuse. So, I have to flag this as abnormal.

&gt;Abusers know that even if someone were to file an FIR against them, nothing would happen. That is what has emboldened them. The right-wing government has mauled every institution, including the police. That is one structural reason. The other is that, like I said earlier, Twitter works so closely with the government.

&gt;You have been on Twitter for nearly a decade. Have you seen any change when it comes to abuse?
Absolutely. **There has been a clear shift since 2012. Before that, it was not possible to defend the Gujarat riots. Since then, it is all about defending the Gujarat riots. 2012 is when Narendra Modi started to project himself as the prime ministerial candidate.

So do you think the LCA came out of Modi *kaka*'s ass? HAL is also a very important contributor to the project and that is solely because the tech knowledge they have gained over a period of time. (And yes, it does take 30+ years to build a fighter jet from scratch - the west took the same time). There are shortcomings, and it is not because the indians working at HAL are incompetent. It is simply because they lack certain technical knowhow that India still needs to master. That is why the UPA deal included a technology transfer clause with DA, where in DA would also have to help them upgrade and setup a new assembly line and train them. I have no doubt that if the original UPA deal had gone through, and we had also tied up with Russia for the fifth generation fighter aircrafts project, India (through HAL) would have become one of the leaders in defence aviation, just as we are in the fields of missile, rockets and nuclear technology.

&gt; It takes longer to assemble planes and it costs more to make by HAL

369,"&gt; On 31 October, the SC directed the Centre to submit details on the purchase of the aircraft after a petition was filed by Prashant Bhushan and former Union ministers Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha demanding a court-monitored investigation into the Rafale deal.

&gt; ... Petitioner Prashant Bhushan said, *‚ÄúWe are filing a rejoinder in the Supreme Court on the government‚Äôs reply on the Rafale deal. The reply is full of loopholes.‚Äù*

&gt; **The Quint** spoke to Bhushan, who pointed out three major loopholes in the government‚Äôs reply to the apex court.

&gt; **PM Modi Announced Purchase of 36 Rafale Aircraft before Cabinet Committee on Security‚Äôs (CCS) Approval**

&gt; The government has claimed in the documents that procedure was followed in the purchase of the Rafale aircraft.

&gt; The procedure that should have been followed was ‚Äì first, ‚Äònegotiation‚Äô between India and France on the pricing of the aircraft; second, ‚Äòapproval‚Äô of the CCS; and third, the Indian government‚Äôs ‚Äòannouncement‚Äô on the procurement of Rafale aircraft.

&gt; But in the case of the Rafale deal, PM Modi made the announcement first and then the negotiation kick-started between India and France, after which the CCS‚Äô approval was obtained.

&gt; **Where Did the Number ‚Äò36‚Äô Come From?*g

&gt; In June 2001, the then Defence Minister approved the procurement of 126 fighter aircraft. The Services Qualitative Requirements (SQRs), which is an essential process to be followed to decide the number of aircraft to be procured, was prepared in June 2006.

&gt; Nowhere in the documents submitted to the SC does the BJP government clarify whose decision it was to purchase 36 aircraft.

&gt; **Lack of Understanding Between HAL &amp; Dassault: Centre**

&gt; In its reply to the SC, the government did not provide any reason for the decrease in the number of aircraft from 126 to 36. The BJP government, instead, points out that the reason for the non-transfer of the aircraft technology to India was that HAL and Dassault Aviation lacked common understanding. Due to this, the contract negotiations could not be concluded even after three years.

&gt; In March 2015 the BJP government started preparing the new Request For Proposal (RFP) and it was completed in June 2015. This means that PM Modi made the joint statement with the French President on Rafale while the new RFP was still being prepared.",2018-11-13 17:27:42
370,"**The Wire** also has a good article explaining how Modi *kaka* has also damaged the institution of ""collective responsibility"" of the cabinet by acting as the supreme leader. (Source: [Rafale Deal Reveals How Cabinet 'Rules of Business' Suffer Under Modi's Rule by Fiat](https://thewire.in/government/rafale-deal-prime-minister-narendra-modi)).

&gt; One cardinal principle of Westminster-style democracy is the collective responsibility of the cabinet. It is as the head of the council of ministers that the PM derives his or her authority, not independent of it. He or she is ‚Äòprimus inter pares ‚Äì first among equals‚Äô in the cabinet ‚Äì not a CEO; nor is the government a Reliance Group company. Not yet.

&gt; **Collective responsibility implies that decisions have to be taken jointly. Even for decisions taken individually, the council as a whole is vicariously responsible.**

&gt; The business of the government is conducted in accordance with a twin set of rules drawn up under Article 77(3) of the constitution called the Rules of Business ‚Äì [Transaction of Business](https://cabsec.gov.in/writereaddata/transactionofbusinessrulescomplete/completeaobrules/english/1_Upload_30.pdf)(pdf) and [Allocation of Business](http://mhrd.gov.in/allocation-business). One regulates the way business is conducted internally. The other determines which ministry does what. **They are framed under the constitution, so they are more than just ‚Äòprocedure‚Äô. They have the force of law.**

&gt; **There may have been many instances where he has neglected to follow constitutional practice. But nothing highlights this more dramatically than the Rafale deal as announced by the prime minister on his visit to Paris in April 2015.**

&gt; As the foreign secretary clarified in a press briefing before the PM‚Äôs departure, purchase decisions do not normally form a part of the agenda at the level of heads of governments (HOG). The Rafale deal was not meant to be either. 

&gt; However, the two HOGs took everyone by surprise by announcing a completely new deal ‚Äì one that did away with the TOT-based manufacture in India, and replaced it with the outright purchase of just 36 aircrafts. This was a decision, not just a declaration of intent.

&gt; **This was a decision of which neither the MoD nor the MEA had any prior knowledge. There were no prior consultations within the government, or if there were, neither the minister(s) nor secretaries concerned had any inkling of it. The Air Force was unaware that their requirement of 126 aircrafts was to be scaled down drastically, and the Ministry of Finance had no opportunity to examine the financial implications of the new deal.**

&gt; It is clear that this decision was taken by the prime minister on his own and not by the cabinet ... **Such a suo motu decision is unconstitutional ab initio, because the PM cannot arrogate to himself the powers of the cabinet without a specific and explicit resolution authorising him to do so.** Post-facto legitimation cannot remove the inherent defect.

&gt; **An added element of illegitimacy is that procurement of capital equipment for defence forces is exclusively the remit of the Raksha Mantri. The PM cannot, by virtue of being first among equals, take over the functions of the minister to whom the business is allocated. Yet, that is exactly what he did. He is not a ‚Äòsuper‚Äô minister, just ‚Äòprime‚Äô.**",2018-11-13 17:52:07

Ehsan Jafri (1929 ‚Äì 28 February 2002) was an Indian politician and former member of the 6th Lok Sabha for the Congress Party, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, which was one of the episodes of mob violence against Muslims during the 2002 Gujarat riots.

On February 28, 2002, he was killed by a mob armed with machetes when he pleaded with them to spare the lives of the women and children who had taken refuge in his home. A Special Investigating Team appointed by the supreme court concluded that he was killed after he fired at an agitated communal Hindu mob outside his house. His widow Zakia Jafri has subsequently argued that the state of Gujarat and its then Chief Minister, now the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, was partly responsible for the violence and for the lack of police intervention in favor of the victims at Gulbarg Society.

8.30am: The office is empty. I like it. I sit down and catch up on reddit, check my mails, fb and my stocks. Say hi to the team as they come in.


9.30am: Younger dude from another team walks up to my desk and asks me if I'm coming out for a smoke. I lug my thermos with me. We go out and shoot the shit. I tend to have younger friends in and out of work because everyone my age is married and really fucking boring. I dont smoke anymore so I sip on my tea while he smokes. 


I ask him if he's coming to the gig on friday. He says yes. We plan the where and when.

A co-worker from the other team asks me for a little clarity on the task we're both on. I help him as much as I can, but not more than I should. I've had bad experiences in collaborating with his team as they have a bad team culture where the blame each other every chance they get.


1pm: Everyone breaks for lunch. I stay at my desk and hit reddit again. I read up on the news, politics and tech in more depth.


2pm: Everyone is back. I pick up my work again. I need to speak to the tech leads of other teams sometimes. I walk up to the one I need to speak to first. He's my age too. His kid is always sick. When his wife was pregnant, I asked him if he felt scared about the future. He said no. I asked him to cut the bullshit and he said he's ready to shit his pants. I nod in understanding. 


The Muslim dude I had intereviewed, waves at me. I wave back. I wish I had something to talk to him about. He's quite religious whereas I'm only Muslim in name. I think he's figured it out because he's stopped asking if I will join him for friday prayer. Friday prayer, man. I havent done that in more than a decade. I scoot back to my desk swiftly


I tell the younger dude behind me about the latest development in geo politics. He is a big proponent of the religious right and is full of nonsensical ideas like how Kim Jong Un drinks the blood of virgins and shit. I remind myself that people like him are the reason Modi is in power. He gives me a right wing spin on whatever I bring up. I dont know why I bother.


3pm: We have meetings around this time. The younger fellas usually doze while us seniors fight something out. It isnt the best, but we just arent able to make these fellas participate. But generally its a constructive enviornment. And its pretty good.



3.30pm: the team breaks for tea. I refill my thermos. I pass a girl I think is cute, on the way to the pantry. She got married, a few months ago. Back at my seat I pass this new girl that is ridiculously pretty. She makes me speechless when she looks at me. I avoid looking at her at all times. 


Most people are at tea. I look around and wonder how long I can do this. I am shit at communicating with people. And I'm not that good an engineer either. I curse myself for picking science when I should have picked arts. I'd have been more comfortable with the subjects, not to mention there non religious lefty sorts are more common there. Its the kind of people I hang out that make up my non-work social circle. I'm not sure what to do with myself tbh. Everyone is getting married, having kids, getting promotions, becoming better employees while I'm nearly 40 - unmarried and absolutely have no ambitions. I wonder when they'll fire me and replace me with someone younger. 


I'd told myself that I never want to grow old. That I'd end my life by 50 so I wouldnt have to deal with old age. 50 is close and both my parents are alive and depend on me financially. I hope they snuff it soon, because I've no long term plans after 50.

Go through through this [article](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/MMRCA-deal-India-to-scrap-20-billion-mega-project-for-126-Rafale-fighter-jets/articleshow/46910444.cms) it will tell you why the original MMRCA was scrapped, and will answer many of the questions you have raised. I am pretty sure that you will come back challenging what Parrikar said, but I am ready. 

Because the negotiations on original MMRCA were stalled, Modi government decided to bypass it buying 2 squadrons through G2G deal, so that IAF can get the aircrafts it need urgently. They have issued a [fresh tender very similar to original MMRCA](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/six-global-companies-respond-to-indias-rfi-for-buying-110-fighter-jets/articleshow/64887437.cms) and I hope this time it is not as convulated as the one issued by UPA, because I remember Manohar Parrikar saying in a TV interview that it was an impossible deal due to several conflicting clauses, and this is not too hard to believe because neither UPA could take the deal to conclusion nor the NDA government.   

So the take away is that we are getting the 36 aircrafts as stop gap measure, and MMRCA v2.0 has been issued. 


&gt; Remember, eurofighter, the other aircraft that qualified on technical part of the competition is on record offering a cheaper deal right now than kaka's 36.

This is wrong on so many level. First you select two aircrafts that meet the technical specifications, then you select the lowest bidder. Then you scrap the original deal and go with second lowest bidder because now it's undercutting the lowest bidder. Throw your country's reputation down the drain for saving few hundred million (or even lesser) dollars. And what if you abandon the lowest bidder, and still can't strike a deal with Eurofighter consortium because overall package is pricier than Dassualt's? What about straining relationship with a country that stood by us during American sanctions? Everybody knows that UK is USA's lapchild, and the consortium has suppliers in so many countries that in time of urgent need things could get nasty.

414,"A thoroughly disingenous and stupid piece of ""journalism"" 

&gt; The Narendra Modi government's decision to submit in a sealed cover all the pricing details of the Rafale fighter jets to the Supreme Court on Monday is a preemptive move to checkmate the Congress' strategy of making it a poll issue this election season. 

Bullshit. The Supreme Court told them to hand it over in a sealed cover. It was not their decision. They were given a ten-day deadline, they were literally made to comply. [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-asks-centre-for-details-on-rafale-pricing-in-sealed-cover-1379239-2018-10-31)

&gt; This reversal was prompted by the realisation that reluctance to share the Rafale pricing details would be making room for the Congress to exploit the subject.

There's zero evidence to suggest this, and even if there was, it doesn't show the BJP in a good light. First the BJP says, it's too sensitive to share. Then they change their mind because ""let's own the Congress""? If this is true, then either they were lying about the sensitivity of the information, or they are placing their electoral gains above national security. Which is it? 

&gt; The decision also indicates that it has finally dawned on the government and the BJP that the Rafale deal is not just a matter of national security, but is a political issue and requires a political solution.

Probably the only semi-accurate part of this article. It is a political problem, but then crony capitalism usually is. 

&gt; In a way, the Centre's change in stand is also a tacit acknowledgement that it had erred in its previous strategy of not treating the Rafale deal as a political issue, hoping that the ""controversy"" would die down on its own, given that there are no irregularities involved. The BJP and the government may have underestimated the power of political narratives built around the stigma of scams in defence purchases. It was far too slow in getting the wind of the Congress' game and even slower in coming out with a counter.

HAHAHAHAHAH. Already forgotten 2014? Already forgotten their own strategies?

My opinion on him:- He spoke from an ideal view but did not dig deep enough. The bureaucrats became the scapegoat for the government and is just a convenient way to shift the blame. He evaded questions which had answers that were definitely going to paint the government in a poor picture. He also evaded talking about demonetisation.

Nehru‚Äôs contribution in the constitution, India‚Äôs flag, Foreign policy, scientific institutions, government institutions, and strengthening of institutions can‚Äôt be ignored, after all he was the leader, accountable for everything. If something happens you ask questions from him. I don‚Äôt know what congress wants, but I think people should read more rather than watching videos on YouTube and memes on twitter and Facebook. He wasn‚Äôt god, no one can be god. One thing I really admire about him is that he never complained, if something wrong happened he‚Äôd try to improve it, rather than blaming someone. Brits looted us and left us in tatters, he didn‚Äôt complain just worked hard to improve India and trying to make it self-sufficient. 

And just 2 weeks before his death, a reporter asked Nehru about his successor, he said I am not dying I am still here. He didn‚Äôt name a successor. Indira Gandhi became the PM, he didn‚Äôt control congressmen from heaven. 

Nehru made Motilal and Gandhi change their stance on dominion status to Complete independence. He was more aggressive, and wanted Gandhi to push the case for complete independence. Yes, he became the president in 1929, it was also because he made Gandhi agree with him and go for complete independence. This was a significant change. Then Nehru raised the flag in Lahore and then Gandhi‚Äôs Declaration of Independence in 1930. Gandhi had veto, he was not bound to Motilal. He could‚Äôve said ‚ÄòNo‚Äô to Nehru for presidency, but he didn‚Äôt that was his choice.

Some of his sacrifices and contributions....


1. His involvement in struggle for independence of India from British Raj, Although he had a lot of conflicting opinions against MK Gandhi, he was as much committed as every one of the founding leaders.

2. Spend 9 years of his life in and out of Jail,loosing his wife to Tuberculosis in process.

3. Post Independence, reform of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu widows to enjoy equality with men in matters of inheritance and property.

4. Solved the problem of the Portuguese colony of Goa in 1961.

5. Build the steel mills at Bokaro and Rourkela with assistance from Soviet Union ( and then the West Germany )

6. 7% industrial growth between 1950 and 1965, with 3-5 % GDP growth.

7. establishment of Agricultural universities, IIT's, NIT's and IIM's ( yes..you read that right ) and Green revolution.

8. Establishment of minimum age for Marriage under special marriage act 1954 ( very significant.. although enforcement was questionable , even till date)

9. Non aligned foreign policy, later Non-colonial policy

10. Establishment of Atomic energy commission of India in 1948, with Dr Bhabha on helm with full control and autonomy.

&gt; Nehru did not steal the prime minister‚Äôs crown from Patel
&gt; 
&gt; It is often imagined by the Indian Right that Patel was India‚Äôs ‚Äúrightful‚Äù first prime minister but was somehow cheated out of the position by Nehru. Modi himself flirted with this thought when, in October last year, he attacked Nehru, bemoaning the fact that Patel would have made a better prime minister. More recently, politician Subramanian Swamy had a more detailed take on the matter:
&gt; 
&gt; Gandhiji took a vote of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) presidents in 1946, and only one of the 16 PCC Presidents voted for Nehru. The other 15 voted for Sardar Patel. But Gandhiji asked Patel to withdraw in favour of Nehru for practical politics ‚Äí to hasten British departure.
&gt; 
&gt; This, as you may know, is an extremely popular tale on the internet. As you also might know, Pradesh Congress Committees voting to elect the prime minister is an absurd proposition ‚Äí a bit like Modi getting elected by BJP state units.
&gt; 
&gt; A variant of this conspiracy theory is that the Pradesh Congress Committees thought they were electing the Congress president (and not the prime minister). But the Congress president at the time of Independence somehow became prime minister (the exact process is never explained). Problems here too: Pradesh Congress Committees don‚Äôt elect Presidents, delegates of the All India Congress Committee do. Moreover, Nehru was not the Congress President when India gained independence, JB Kripalani was. Tragically, no one informed Kripalani of this mechanism and he remained bereft of prime ministership right until his dying day.
&gt; 
&gt; The simple reason as to why Nehru became PM was that he was, by far, the Congress‚Äô most popular politician (after Gandhi, of course). Right from the 1937 provincial elections, Nehru was the party‚Äôs star campaigner, enthralling crowds with his Hindustani oratory. Patel had an iron grip on the Congress party itself but he was many miles behind Nehru as a popular leader. The Sardar himself conceded this: at a massively attended Congress rally in Mumbai, he told American journalist Vincent Sheean, ‚ÄúThey come for Jawahar, not for me.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, in 1946, when the Viceroy formed his interim government, Nehru was, unsurprisingly, given the highest post. Later, on August 15, 1947, he naturally took office as prime minister, without the least opposition from anyone in the Congress.

483,"The headline is very misleading.

- The CBI is run by the central government.
- They can't investigate any case in any state in India without the permission of the state government or the orders of a court.
- Andhra Pradesh has been giving them a free pass, through a government order, to freely investigate any case in AP. 
- After the TDP parted ways with the NDA, and the CBI directors and the PMO got involved in a scandal, TDP government has withdrew the order.
- They claim it is to ensure that the Modi government doesn't misuse the CBI against them.
- This means that if the CBI wants to conduct any investigation again in AP, it will again have to request the state government's permission.",2018-11-16 22:09:22
