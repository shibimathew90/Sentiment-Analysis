---

&gt;* The government and opposition today worked out a plan to allow the Rajya Sabha to run during the Budget Session of Parliament, which begins on Tuesday.

&gt;* The JNU Crisis and Hyderabad University scholar Rohith Vemula's death will be debated before any bill is taken up, it was decided.The agreement came following a strong nudge from the Vice President and Chairman of the Upper House, Hamid Ansari, at an all-party meeting attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.None of the important pending legislations including the Goods and Services Tax or GST, bankruptcy and real estate bills will be taken up in the first part of the session which ends in March, it was decided today.Mr Ansari set the tone for the truce with his strong-worded appeal for ""debate not disruption"" in the Upper House which has witnessed virtually no business being conducted for the last few sessions.

&gt;* He told government and opposition representatives, ""Time has come to assure the public that Parliamentary democracy works and is sensitive to the needs of its citizen.

&gt;* ""Apparently worried over the negative perception Parliamentary disruptions are creating, the opposition agreed to short term discussions on the two issues at the very start of the session.

&gt;* Once the debates on issue flagged by the opposition are over they would have to keep their side of the bargain,"" a senior minister told NDTV.Mr Ansari has been holding meetings to end the deadlock, including one between the government and the Congress leaders earlier this week.

&gt; * What could be an act more uncontroversial, more unexceptionable, than flying the national flag prominently and proudly in a public place in this country, more so on a campus, where the young forge the future?

&gt; * Yet, the decision to do so, taken by the heads of Central universities, on their respective campuses, strikes a note that jars.

&gt; * Consider this: The decision was taken in a meeting called mainly to discuss the issue of discrimination on campus, framed starkly by the suicide of Dalit student Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad, after he was hounded by a university administration and government that had labelled a protest undertaken by him as anti-national.

&gt; * In this context, the resolve to fly the tricolour on the Central university campus  incidentally, it already flies on several campuses, without government diktat  smacks of the Modi governments attempt to use it as cover for squelching the voices of debate and dissent.

10,"I see a lot of people who deny that such state of affairs is reality. The polarization is just online, they say. Go talk to people and you'll find that nothing has changed, they say. But, things have changed.

Rigid right wing (*khattar*, for lack of a better word) views used to be politically incorrect, at least where I come from. Discrimination based on caste has existed there forever, but a jingoistic ideal of nationalism that is integrated with Hindutva and ""culture"" hadn't been there before 2014. Everybody had their own ideologies and interpretation of ideals. Labels were not that common. Personally, I identify towards the liberal left in the whole spectrum. I remember that a BJP supporter had a problem with how the left had changed the meaning of the word *bhakt*. I remarked to him how the right had maligned the very idea of secularism by coining the terms *pseudo-secular* and *sickular*. They keep arguing that the meaning of secularism is different in India. No, it fuckin' isn't. Secularism is defined.

&gt; Secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons mandated to represent the state from religious institutions and religious dignitaries.

Tolerance and secularism are two interdependent but different ideas and by saying secularism in India is same as tolerance of other faiths, you are implicitly condoning the idea that religion can influence state working. Voila! Green ticket to Hindutva. You sneaky bastards. They don't get that this view isn't quite consistent with their idea that Muslim Personal Law should give way to Uniform Civil Code. And, don't forget to manufacture a narrative that Hindutva is not about religion but about culture. Well guess what, we don't like cultural conservatism too. To people who say Hinduism is not a religion but a set of philosophies and a way of life, well, that's what every religious guy out there thinks of his own religion.

I am surprised how people cannot see through all the attempts to manufacture a different historical narrative from what we have studied in school. ""Fuck Gandhi. Fuck Nehru. Fuck the Gandhi family. Jai Sardar Patel. Jai Bose."" They keep saying that they are correcting history but all I see is *engineering* for getting votes and establishing core vote banks. By eroding and discrediting the legacy of Gandhi and Nehru, they seek to erase egalitarian founding principles from public memory.

What surprises me more is the inability of the left, or the centre of left to throw up one good leader that can measure up to Modi in public eye.

Though the role of social media manipulation in all this polarization and narrative manufacture has to be studied, I suspect it isn't small. Americans say Trump vs Sanders shows how polarized they have become. Europeans are polarized on the refugee crisis. So, I suppose that we should have seen this coming as one of the biggest working democracies. To sum it up, I'm distressed and I'm out.",2016-02-21 12:32:56
11,"Relax, this is just a phase. Any country's goes through many types of phases. This regression is a phase which will lead to some kind of a big incident, then there will be a phase of liberalism, then liberalism will go too far and conservatives will again gain stock and so on and so on.

Let me just tell you, I believe in India so much that even if Modi is literally Hitler, I don't worry about India. I know we would throw him away if he would try to destroy democracy. It won't be pretty, a lot of people might die including you and me. But, India and its liberal ideals will survive. They would be wounded and would require healing, but they would survive.

If you are asking if we would need to cross a phase of pure fascism to reach the restoration stage, I don't know. Mostly, this or any government is not a fool. They should know that if they overplay their hand, there will not be Hindutvawadi government in India for a century and I think they know it. That is why they play the game of testing the waters and we liberals just show them what can happen.",2016-02-21 12:41:43

&gt; * In its Global Macro Outlook released on Thursday, Moody's said India is relatively insulated from external turmoil and put growth for the country over the next two years at a stable 7.5%.

&gt; * ""Together with Turkey and China among the G20 emerging markets, India benefits from lower commodity prices: in 2014, net commodity imports amounted to 5.9% of India's GDP, compared with net exports worth 1.3%, 3.3% and 4.3% for South Africa , Brazil and Indonesia, respectively,"" it said.Headline inflation in India will depend on the weather during the planting season.

&gt; * Without particularly unfavourable weather conditions, it estimates inflation will rise from last year's levels (4.9% on average) and fall back to the central bank's target of 5% by early 2017.Another year of moderate price gains will help anchor inflation expectations and foster both consumer spending and investment, Moody's said.

21,"Everybody has started living in their echo chambers where there is no middle ground. Either you are with or against. 
Among the literate, a large part of the blame lies with the social media. For example, its very easy to find people with your likes. eg. you can easily join I love kejri or I love modi page. On each of these pages you will see posts glorifying the dear leader at the same time deriding the opposite.

After all, I love X page will never post a negative thing about X, right? So you have people pandering to the  crowd in their echo chamber group, getting even more and more brainwashed and paralyzed.

Since there is only one opinion, they lose all power of critical thinking.

So their definition of right and wrong become quite simple. If X did something its right, if Y did something its wrong.

This is what is happening in our society. Its becoming a CS gaming session where you are either with or against. There is no middle ground, there is no reasoning, there is no debate. Only sloganeering and shouting.

Lol.Not Mistakenly.It was proved by other prominent channel that he did it on purpose just to create more and more tension between Hindus and JNU's for his usual masala talk show. Kanhaiya was there in that Arnab show when Sambit Patra as irritating as he usually is,to prove his balls are bigger,showed a video which was proved doctored.And Arnab let that happen that time so he could get another week of his shit show.This simple reason of TRP led this rigmarole grow further more.

&gt; Suddenly JNU assholes became guilt free? Afzal became a hero.

If he would have had proper Political connections,that dead rotting maggot called Afzal would have been a minister today,somewhere in Kashmir as a member of PDP party and Narendra Modi would have been wiping his ass everyday for power.
Now they happily let extremists hoist Pakistan flags and because these Hindus can't dare to create Riots in Kashmir (gand mein dum nahi hai),they do the next best thing,target students who are obviously naive.They can be put back in sense,but no,Hindus wants to send a message of strong arming,bow before us or we will put sedition charges just like britishers did to us RSS monkeys who were doing mischiefs and letting their ass being fucked by the whites for money.


If Narendra Modi can get a clean chit as a result  of destruction of evidence, as he masterminded the Gurat riot (as revealed sarcastically by Vajpayee),same way Afzal could have got the same.Only the difference is,Afzal did his crime during Vajpayee regime,and was later hanged by Congress led govt.The same PDP party were raising Anti-National slogans much more worse than those students.They even went to extreme length of burning Indian flags,which ironically,they all sworned oath under it for ministry.


Who knows what.We know nothing but just hearsays and India is the country where hearsays always works if it is propogated in a extravagant manner.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi today alleged that disgruntled NGOs and black-marketeers were conspiring to destabilise the government and ""defame"" him and asserted that he will not bow to any machinations.He said ""some people"" were not able to digest the fact that a ""chai wala"" (tea seller) has become the Prime Minister and hence were conspiring all the time to bring him down.

&gt;* They are not able to digest how Modi became the Prime Minister, how a 'chai wala' became the Prime Minister, they cannot swallow it,"" a combative PM Modi said addressing a farmers' rally Odisha's Bargarh.Without naming anybody or any specific instance, he said he had taken some steps because of which ""these people are facing problems"".He made the remarks while talking about the neem-coating of urea being done to avoid its pilferage and routing to chemical factories like in the past.

&gt;* Will they not shout against Modi,"" he asked the gathering.The prime minister said that NGOs receive money from foreign countries and his government was seeking the account.

&gt;* Let us all make some contribution to fufill the dreams of those who fought for the Independence,"" he said.With regard to the 2nd Green Revolution, he said the entire eastern region is full of natural resources including water and has the potential to emerge as the place for production of food grains to feed the entire nation.

&gt;* You need to do it for increasing the income of the family,"" PM Modi suggested to the gathering which chanted 'Modi.. Modi.. Modi', all through his 50-minute long speech.Stating that transformation in India's agriculture sector has to be made, the prime minister said his government has pledged to develop the eastern states besides north eastern states.

37,"The major problem here is the right wing works on sentiments while the left try to articulate their sentiments. The right simply lack power house think tanks and intellectuals who could put words to their sentiments. So they usually are scattered grunts and head shakes.

So in the media the Hindu's(right wing) have always heard the stalwart left intellectuals bashing them, the upper castes who had nothing to do with castism,the religious who had nothing to do with cultural insularity, the culturally insular who had nothing to do with the riots, but maybe one thing they all shared was an inertia towards radical changing of the status quo and nobody within them articulated for them why they should or shouldn't. They felt attacked against, they felt they are increasingly being removed from the familiar world that they grew up in and that was alarming. Its a battle between reality and perception, if the reality that is articulated by the left  doesn't match how the right perceives it or how they were taught to perceive it, either they will reject the reality(because perception is closer to mind and easier to access than reality itself) or subscribe to versions that are concurrent with their perception. The same problem lies with left as well, both take up an issue and goes to the two extreme sides of it. That is why you would find the right usually reject legitimacy to an issue by saying that it simply is not common enough to consider it the norm and is only an exception. The left too cherry picks to confirm their biases, everybody does, everybody guards their own perception of reality.   

Increasingly vocal left cut through the heart of right while the counter balance that formed were just grunters and head shakers, not because they didn't have anything to say, but because they couldn't say what they wanted to. So when somebody comes along who even barely puts their sentiments into words and confirms their biases they tend to parrot it. 

Solution lies in not countering the right wing, if the consolidation and polarization continues like this it can simply steam roll over everything else because of it's sheer numbers(something that they think does really matter) but it getting a more level headed and articulate leadership. Modi knows better than to crown himself the emperor of India, seeing how India reacted to the emergency and how his flagship economic reforms include high levels of foreign investment. Turning India into a dictatorship and throwing it open to the possibility of civil unrest and even a civil war doesn't seem to be in his agenda.

I don't doubt the right wing's intentions in making 'bharat mahan' and bringing 'ache din' but they need a contingent of intellectuals to represent their views reasonably and make them feel like everybody is working towards making the same nation great.  ",2016-02-21 19:40:22

* The caste system
* Muslims having a bad time in India

We can expect many of these to be based on unverifiable or made up ""facts"", with those who are grouped with Modi and are far from media-savvy to provide a rich source of material.

I am expecting Modi to avoid making mistakes made by Vajpayee, that is, quietly pushing for economic growth and using calibrated Hindu nationalism to win elections in key areas.

---

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Hitting out at older carriers, top industrialist Ratan Tata on Sunday accused them of lobbying and using ""monopolistic pressures"" to retain preferential treatment under the controversial 5/20 rule that restricts overseas flying by new airlines.Reacting strongly to the charge, low-cost carrier SpiceJet's chief Ajay Singh asked him to rather advice the two airlines associated with Tatas - Vistara and AirAsia India - to first serve India and then seek to fly international.Singh also alleged that the two carriers were apparently controlled by their foreign parents and said they had undertaken, while applying for the licence, to follow the 5/20 rule which they are opposing so vehemently now.AirAsia India and Vistara - two airlines operated by the Tatas through joint ventures - are presently ineligible to operate overseas under the 5/20 norm, which requires an Indian carrier to have minimum five years operational experience and at least 20 planes to operate international flights.The government is currently in advanced stage of finalizing its new civil aviation policy, wherein one of the proposals is to scrap the 5/20 rule.While several older airlines including SpiceJet, Jet Airways, IndiGo and GoAir are vehemently opposing any move to scrap the 5/20 norm, Tata has applauded the civil aviation ministry's proposal to remove the ""controversial"" rule.Terming as sad the lobbying of incumbent airlines for ""protection and preferential treatment"", he tweeted that such moves were reminiscent of the monopolistic pressures by entities with vested interests who fear competition.

&gt; * ""In the airline industry in India, it is sad to see the incumbent airlines lobbying for protection and preferential treatment for themselves against the new airlines...""...(the new airlines) have been formed in full compliance with prevailing government policy and providing air transport to Indian citizens in line with the dream of a 'New India' promoted by the new government under (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi's leadership,"" said Tata, who was instrumental in the group's re-entry to the aviation sector.Tata Group and Singapore Airlines together run Vistara, while AirAsia is a three-way joint venture between Tatas, Malaysia's AirAsia and Arun Bhatia's Telestra.AirAsia India is less than 2-year-old with six aircraft, while Vistara was started in January 2015 and has nine planes.With the government considering the removal of 5/20 norm, Tata said, ""One hopes when the new policy is introduced it will be free of discrimination and protectionism, so that Indian aviation can grow for the benefit of consumer and the common man -- not to serve the interests of select beneficiaries of protectionism.

&gt; * ""According to Tata, the call for a new open market economy in India, in line with policies promised by Modi, will ""promote growth in an open market based on competitiveness and not from self interest-based protectionism"".Reacting to Tata's comments, SpiceJet's Singh said all the airlines were asked ""to serve our great country before we got profitable rights to fly abroad"" under the 5/20 rule.

&gt; * ""Mr Tata, whom we respect greatly, should in fact urge these airlines in which his group is a shareholder, to serve India willingly before being allowed to fly international,"" Singh said.The SpiceJet chief further said that the two airlines associated with Tata group had undertaken to follow the 5/20 rule while obtaining their licenses, but ""they are now opposing (this rule) so vehemently"".He also alleged that ""it is evident that these airlines are controlled by their foreign parents"".

&gt; * But my friends, you have voted me to rid the country of these diseases,"" he said.Modi compared the NGOS to black marketeers of urea, whose pilferage and diversion for use in chemical factories, he said, had been stopped by the government's decision to coat urea with neem.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh , referring to the raging debate on nationalism stirred by the arrest of a student leader from Jawaharlal Nehru University, lashed out at the PM.

(Before this campaign, people used to throw wherever they wanted in my street but all of the that suddenly changed and every household has garbage bin collector now, which is emptied every day by the municipal workers)

Economy - In relative to the world, we are way better off with record FDI and growth above 7%.

External affairs - quick evacuation of Indians and other foreign nationals from Iraq/Yemen. Even though US banned modi, he didn't show any hostile attitude towards the Americans. 

Electricity - Thanks to goyals efficiency, coal plants in TN are running on full capacity, so we have 24/7 power (even during peak hours)

HRD - I have nothing against Hindi or Sanskrit but forcing it to people who don't want to learn it, is a shitty thing to do. (Plus JNU and Hyderabad UNI)

---

&gt;* KURRUBHAT, CHHATTISGARH:A 104-year-old woman from a village in Chhattisgarhs Dhamtari district who sold her goats for constructing toilet at her home, today came in for special praise by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said it is a big sign of changing India.

&gt;* An elderly woman of 104 years who stays in a remote village, does not watch TV or read papers, but the message of building toilets under clean India mission somehow reached her.

&gt;* PM Modi also praised the residents of two Ambagarh Chowki and Chhuriya blocks for being open defecation free with toilets at all homes.

&gt;* Even a Prime Minister has to think before enforcing taxes (on public), but people in these blocks without hesitation decided to slap fine on those who defecated in open which is a good initiative for the welfare of society, he said.

&gt;* Making an area open defecation free is a biggest advantage and respect to our mother and sisters who have to go down to fields and forests (to relieve themselves).

77,"Vajpayee and Advani had the benefit of having worked for many decades in the opposition first building the Jan Sangh and were a key part of the Janata Party government and then built up the BJP. So they had built personal relationships with all the major politicians.

Modi and Shah on the other hand joined the BJP in late 80s and have only seen one success after another and have had no reason to work with the opposition, and their aggressive stance worked in Gujarat where they only had one party to deal with in the assembly. 

It still doesn't seem to have sunk in that they cannot replicate their ""Gujarat model"" in the Lok Sabha, where even their single party majority won't allow them to do even pass simple bills.

The land reform ordinances were a major fuckup where they ensured battle lines were drawn and couldn't achieve anything.  And all the constant name calling of opposition leaders doesn't exactly help build bridges/mend fences either.",2016-02-22 03:40:05
78,"Did a hormone rush get the better of you when going through the thread? Explaining and justifying are two different things. Neither act was justified. Let's try this again.

You do live in India, right? You do realise that the Gujarat riots were neither the first nor the worst communal riots in post-independence India, right? Did you conveniently forget that there were courts then too, or did the courts and police materialise only after the year 2000? Bhagalpur, 1989, Congress rule. And of course, the famous one in 1984, Congress rule again. No courts, no police then? Your selective stringency in applying standards is rather interesting; I should do that as well.

Let's get past the sarcasm and attempt now to understand each other's position. Arguing that the riots can't be justified is a straw man. But they can certainly be explained and the explanation I gave on the 2002 riots is the most reasonable one; actually, one rather obvious to a dispassionate observer.

To your crack about ""agents of the state"", which is really about Modi (remember, ""Hitler"", literally dictator, control freak and all that from the ELM), Modi asked Digvijay (yes, the same Digvijay) for help. Digvijay refused, and lied about it in his tweet later. [Here](http://indiafacts.org/digvijaya-singh-didnt-receive-request-for-help-from-modi/) are the facts. Go ahead, read it. 

So, either Modi did not have control over the ""agents"" anywhere to the extent alleged by the ELM, or he did not have the law and order resources. Both would have been easily visible in 2002 itself. That would absolve him of all the vicious personal attacks that began then, and perhaps that is the reason the highest court in the land did let him go, despite his sworn enemies controlling every other ""agents of the state"" for a decade.

If you want to prevent such riots in the long run, making shrill cries about Hindutva and Modi is not the way to go about it. Saying that the compartment spontaneously combusted is not it either. Get rid of vote bank politics, and get rid of religious leaderships telling people who to vote for. Get rid of the practice of people having more children than they can support up to graduation from college. Of course, none of that is easy, and I won't force you on those points, but you need to realise that the political landscape in India is the way it is for partly historical reasons which you can't wish away but mostly policy *set by the Congress through decades*.",2016-02-22 05:40:04

&gt;Government spokesmen often speak of the menace of Maoism, specifically its violent and sometimes effective challenge to the authority of the State in India's hinterland. In Patiala House, a bunch of lawyers successfully established a zone of lumpen liberty within shouting distance of the Supreme Court, of Parliament and the great secretariats of the Indian Union.

&gt;In the twilight of the Mughal empire, the grandly styled Shah Alam barely controlled its capital. **""Sultanat-e-Shah Alam az Dilli ta Palam""** was the Farsi doggerel that mocked the emperor's pretensions. The distance between Parliament House and Patiala House is considerably smaller than that between the Red Fort and Palam. **Does this mean that the political writ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his pomp doesn't extend to the India Gate Circle?** No, Mr Modi's power is intact; it is the authority of the republic that has suffered a check. The lower judiciary and a rabidly chauvinistic mob collided and the mob won because one of the republic's sinews, the police, controlled by the Union government, chose not to challenge the mob or to arrest its leaders.",2016-02-22 11:03:38

&gt; * NEW DELHI/DHAKA: State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) is poised to seal a contract to build a $1.6 billion power plant in Bangladesh, beating out a Chinese competitor in the latest commercial tussle between the region's two dominant powers.After China's recent success in pushing development projects in Sri Lanka, a breakthrough in Bangladesh would be welcome news for Indian officials who have long fretted over Beijing's encroachment on to territory it considers its own back yard.India believes Bangladesh is a part of a ""String of Pearls"" China is building across the Indian Ocean that stretches from Gwadar port in Pakistan to Djibouti on the African coast where it is building a naval base.After years of negotiations, BHEL will sign a contract to build a 1,320-megawatt (MW) thermal power station in Khulna in southern Bangladesh on Feb. 28, officials in New Delhi and Dhaka said.China's Harbin Electric International Company Ltd, which has power projects in Iran, Turkey and Indonesia among others, lost the bid on technical grounds, said a Bangladesh official, speaking on condition of anonymity since he was not authorised to talk to journalists.But Anwarul Azim, a spokesman for the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company Limited, a joint venture set up to build the coal-fired plant, said BHEL was the lowest bidder.The Indian government's external lending arm, the Exim Bank, has backed up BHEL's offer with nearly 70 percent funding of the project's costs at a soft interest rate of around 1 percent above Libor, the leading global benchmark for pricing transactions, an Indian government official said.He declined to be named, saying the two sides were about to seal the contract.On Friday, Libor stood at 1.13 percent for a dollar loan for a year.

&gt; * ""Exim is very positive about it, very bullish about it and looking to taking this forward,"" David Rasquinha, the bank's deputy managing director, told Reuters of the Khulna project.It would be the biggest foreign project by an Indian power firm, eclipsing a plant already built in Rwanda and a planned one in Sri Lanka.Officials at China's Harbin who dealt with the bid were not immediately available for comment.But an employee in the after-sale service department said: ""The company has been involved in many such tenders, it is very normal - either we win or lose the bids.

&gt; * ""India and China have stepped up bids for infrastructure projects in the region in recent years, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushing for a greater engagement with smaller neighbours after years of neglect.The loss of the power project is the second setback for China, after Japan muscled into Bangladesh's port sector last year, offering 80 percent financing on easy terms for a seaport, barely 25 km from a $8 billion deep water port that Beijing was negotiating to construct.The proposed power plant will have two units of 660 MW that will generate power for local consumption.

&gt; * ""This will have a devastating and irreversible impact on the Sundarbans, its ecology and biodiversity,"" said Anu Mohammad, secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Power, Port and Mineral Resources.

&gt;* In an interview to the newswire Reuters, he said people had the right to be critical in a democracy, but he did not have any guilty feeling.

&gt;* Mr. Modi also contended that the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team had given him a clean chit.

Properties which belonged to Punjabi caste were specifically looted and burned in Rohtak by the Jat mob. There were clashes between sainis and jats in Jhajjar town where mob destroyed many non-jat properties and also destroyed the statue of freedom fighter Rao Tula Ram. 

Police completely failed to control the mob so the army was called in, army also failed to control mobs in many areas as they were very few in numbers as compared to mob. The mob destroying the cities were mainly brought in from villages by the jat leaders in tractors armed with sticks, swords and other weapons.

* Law &amp; justice needs to bring in more reforms. Gowda is a dumbass. 
* Agriculture - agrarian distress still persist. Real engagement with the farmers is missing. Try Rajnath here (huge demotion for him).

Technocrats needed

* I&amp;B
* Communications and Information Technology
* Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation

Slow movers (can think about moving):

* Civil Aviation - A new aviation policy is being worked upon from what we hear. Pretty good if they can get that implemented 5 years along with the no-frills airports proposal.

* Health and Family Welfare - Hit by low budgetary provisions. Need to do more about affordable drugs, medical practices etc. A very visible area. Dr. Harshvardhan should really be handling this.

* Labour and Employment - Not sure if the Skill India mission is on track/lagging?

* Urban Development - Good progress of the smart cities initiative but need more. This is another area which is very visible.

&gt;* India is not immune to the threat from ISIS, the UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, has warned in exclusive interview to NDTV in Abu Dhabi.The UAE has been in forefront of the fight against ISIS, also known as Daesh.Ahead of the visit to India this week of Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Dr Gargash told NDTV: ""This is a long-term threat we need to cooperate, need to have zero tolerance.

&gt;* ""India and the UAE have started a new strategic partnership after a landmark visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Abu Dhabi in August, which includes unprecedented cooperation on counter terrorism, especially significant given that the UAE has traditionally been a close ally of Pakistan.Over the past year, about a dozen Indians with links to the ISIS have been deported from the UAE.To a question on whether Pakistan was doing enough to crack down on terror groups after the Pathankot terror attack, Dr Gargash said: ""The UAE doesn't see a grey area in our rejection of terrorism, whether by a non-government group or whether sponsored by governments, we put all that in the same pile, terrorism is terrorism.""

&gt;* ""PM Modi visited UAE in August, becoming the first prime minister to do so in three decades.

&gt;* During the visit, the oil-rich Gulf nation announced it would invest $75 billion in Foreign Direct Investment in infrastructure projects in India, but that seems to be taking time.The minister said: ""India is already an attractive investment destination but we need to work together to cut some of the red tape, make things smoother.

&gt;* I want to see clearer laws, smoother implementation, greater foreign investment,"" he said.

http://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/jaitley-slashes-education-health-spending-115030200569_1.html

Economists like Joseph Stiglitz or Paul Krugman, and other Keynesian economists make a lot of sense to me. I've read what people like Amartya Sen and Piketty say, and I agree with *some* things they advocate but not all.

More radical free market idea though, I think would be dangerous for India. I think what the US democrats envision for their country, Nordic States or most of Western Europe is what India should strive for eventually.

Politically I'm a fan of centrist and center left parties. If someone like the US democrats existed in India existed I would vote for them. Sadly I get to choose between CPM and TMC. So nota or just not voting is what I do.

I think the far left - Naxalites and Maoists are dangerous for sure, but they have been made irrelevant in Indian politics. Even the CPM exists only in Kerala and WB. Sadly most states have a very thuggish and opportunistic populist mob rule now (WB, UP, Bihar somewhat) led by personality cults and goonda cadres. So even too much democracy or direct democracy could be a problem.

The far right otoh is extremely dangerous and whenever jingoism and fascism start to appear countries take a nose dive. 

Even Islamism is a far right fascist ideology. Great article by the late Christopher Hitchens explaining this:

&gt;* Normal water supply to the capital from Haryana, which has been disrupted due to the Jat stir, will soon get restored with AAP leader Ashutosh taking control of the Munak Canal.AAP government in Delhi, which has been rebuked by Supreme Court for not taking adequate steps to solve water problem has decided to utilize the talent of senior party leader Ashutosh, who excels in shedding crocodile tears.It should be recalled that in the aftermath of farmer Gajendra Singh's suicide during a rally conducted by AAP last year, when Ashutosh was confronted by Gajendra's daughter, who accused AAP of abetting his father's suicide, Ashutosh immediately burst into a bout of tears.

&gt;* ""Earlier we were thinking of installing a water pipeline passing through Ashutosh's eyes, but since that process would have taken time, we thought it was better if Ashutosh goes to Munak Canal instead,"" Water Minister Kapil Mishra revealed.Sources claim, as soon as Ashutosh reached the Munal Canal site, he forgot why he was there and being a protest enthusiast himself, couldn't resist joining the protests that were going on.

&gt;* It was slightly challenging for me to convince the anarchist in me that I was there to solve the water problem and not to further intensify it,"" Ashutosh admitted.After requesting Jat community to shift to Jantar Mantar for protests, AAP made Ashutosh face Delhi voters, who were disgruntled with party's governance in the city.

&gt;* Unable to explain what AAP government had done to fulfill its promises of free Wi-Fi, 15 lakh CCTV cameras etc, Ashutosh started shedding crocodile tears requesting Modi to stop doing 'gandi rajneeti'.The process went on till the canal started over flowing, following which Ashutosh was shown his own tweets to stop him from crying.

&gt;* Meanwhile, unable to take bath today due to no water in 7 RCR, PM Modi flew off to Mediterranean Sea for his next foreign visit.

158,"A Letter To PM Modi From 'Anti-National Sickular Presstitute' Barkha Dutt

---

&gt;* Modiji, I take you back to the years before you became Chief Minister and began the ""othering"" of large sections of the English media whom you were convinced were out to get you: when you were the approachable and friendly General Secretary of the BJP, and I was a young reporter still learning the ropes.

&gt;* In a country that took pride in giving even Ajmal Kasab, a 26/11 perpetrator, a fair trial, a young man whose worst crime (and that's if you stretch it) is that he could not stop a handful of other students from raising some admittedly disturbing slogans - has been slapped and pushed around in court in the presence of a police that failed or perhaps refused to protect him.

&gt;* Do you not, Mr. Prime Minister, agree that if you can visit Lahore to greet Nawaz Sharif on his birthday despite the specter of terrorism (and I thought it was spectacularly bold of you), if you can negotiate with Naga secessionists and proudly announce a peace accord (the details of which are still awaited), if you can ally with the PDP whose leader Mehbooba Mufti believes not just that Afzal Guru should not have been executed, but has, as part of her father's ""healing touch"", often visited the families of dead militants because she does not think their children should be punished - if you can take these decisions and never have your patriotism questioned, do you not think it's a crazy over-reaction of the government to arrest a young man for slogans that it now turns out weren't even his own?

&gt;* And what was your thought when you opened the morning newspapers to see a legislator of your party pounce on an opposition activist who lay flat on the road with hands folded in fright, an image that made national and international headlines for both the asymmetry and abuse of power it conveyed?

&gt;* You wouldn't need me to remind you of the famous case Balwant Singh Vs State of Punjab - the Supreme Court overturned the charge of sedition and acquitted those who had shouted, ""Khalistan Zindabad, Raj Karega Khalsa"" a few hours after Indira Gandhi's assassination.

173,"The religious minorities were always targets of persecution and genocides in India to some extent, but things are changing very fast. FOR THE WORSE.

India is doomed. Two years ago, rightwing extremist, Hindu Nationalist party got complete majority thanks to Hindutva chickenhawks from Hindi heartland. The most fascist leader (Modi) in the history of independent India has been elected Prime Minister. There have been several riots since the election because the goons of the RSS (ideologue and mentor organization of the Bhartiya Janta Party) have been emboldened. This is, by the way, the same organization that killed Mahatma Gandhi because he was too secular. There have been several incidents of mass forced conversions of Muslims and Christians and the govt forced schools and colleges to remain open on Chistmas. (Is it a coincidence that the [PM Modi even resembles the Grinch](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ranjani-iyer-mohanty-indians-defy-the-modi-grinch-1419355992) in looks?) They have even started putting restrictions on very private practices of religious minorities - for example, by banning beef to appease the majority Hindu sentiment. 

This Modi achieved fame and popularity amongst right-wing Hindu extremists after orchestrating mass-killings Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. Entire colonies were burnt. Women and little children were raped. They would cut open the wombs of pregnant women and kill the foetus too. Modi was famously called ""Butcher of Gujarat"" for this incident, and wears that tag as a medal around his neck. When asked whether he had any regrets about 2002, he said that he compared their deaths to puppies being driven over by cars.

Attacks on minorities, especially Christians, are on the rise. Hindu fascists have attacked and vandalized several churches in the country. (Are you surprised? Fundamentalists by definition will behave in this manner!) In one instance, they even [gang raped a 71 year old Nun](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/archbishop-clears-mamata-blames-modi-govt-for-rising-violence-against-minorities/). Horrific, isn't it?  But, know that this  is only the start because BJP is taking it slow initially as there are many state elections during the first two years. Soon though, it is expected that Modi will demolish any semblance of rights that minority had in the country. 

On the economy front, the new govt is selling the resources of India to the big corporates like Ambani and Adani who funded the lavish election campaign. The corporates and the government will make lots of money, whereas we, the consumers, will reel under the pressure of much higher prices for food, energy and even mobile phone usage. Recently, they passed an ordinance to forcibly acquire (steal) land from poor farmers to give to industrialists so they can loot the resources faster. 

There might still be hope, for there is an honest, capable, secular leader, Arvind Kejriwal, that seems to be giving him a tough fight in the national capital, Delhi where he has been given the most decisive mandate in the history of Indian electoral politics. People love him because he is honest, well-educated, sincere and has lead the fight against corruption almost single-handedly since the inception.  If even he loses against BJP, it is safe to say that India as  we know and love it  (secular, democratic) will surely be gone forever. The stakes are very high and all secularists of India need to join forces if there is to be any hope to stop the fascists from returning to power.

And the voters voted for progress, not this hindutva bullshit (that's definitely something the BJP doesn't learn).

The voters learn from their mistakes pretty well, UP hasn't voted for BJP even once after making the mistake of voting for them during the Babri demolition, and while it seems that it's about to finally break again, we don't know for sure whther it will. The voters are the ones who have resisted Sangh's ideology as a block for 65 years, which was much more influential in the atermath of Partition tensions than today btw. It's time to stop blaming the people and the whole 'dumb Indians voted for dumb BJP', the voters have been the barrier between a secular India and a Hindu Pakistan ever since the Independence. It's not their fault Modi had a lot of money to throw at relatively easy PR management of a voter base most of which doesn't remember BJP's hayday of violence.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Adviser to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz has revealed that one of the mobile phone numbers linked to those who attacked the Pathankot airbase had been traced to the Jaish-e-Mohammed groups headquarters in Bahawalpur.

&gt;* Speaking to Karan Thapar of Headlines Today, Mr Aziz said that Azhar, along with a few other operatives of JeM, had been kept under protective custody and that some of the JeMs premises had been sealed.

&gt;* Mr Aziz said the FIR filed four days back in the Pathankot attack case had created legal basis for a Special Investigation Team of Pakistan to visit India to collect evidence.

&gt;* Asked about Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikars comment that SIT would not be allowed to go inside the airbase in Pathankot, Mr Aziz said access to crime scene always helped investigators.

&gt;* The answer to it lies entirely with India, he said, adding he hoped Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif would meet on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington next month.

One voter in fact showed us copy of a book authored by NDTV on ""How to scratch a politician's back and win a Padma Shri""  Barkha also has fan pages on Facebook "" ""Take Barkha off the air"" and ""Barkha for worst journalist on the planet"" !! Nobody, nobody does it better than our Barkha. She was a hands-down winner !! Update: Is now on the defence over the Radia tapes leak. Retains her no.1 position and probably is now too low for even zero.



2012:

For the second time in a row Barkha retains her position as India’s worst journalist in the poll, by a whopping margin. The only road to redemption is apologising for past blunders. While she and another one have been vocal in demanding apologies and expressions of remorse from public figures the same standard doesn’t seem to apply to her. No matter what she does the taint of Radiagate and many other indiscretions are unlikely to disappear. The accusations of causing deaths in Kargil or in 26/11 are also going to linger.  She is probably the only news celeb on TV that has a ‘wardrobe sponsor’. All the image makeovers may not help much. Most of us have held Rahul Gandhi for the Congress’ UP election disaster but Barkha and NDTV must be credited with the disaster too. No one has singularly promoted RG and his cause and almost turned him into India’s saviour till the engine got derailed. Her penchant for Pakistani politics and politicians is another thing that disgusts many viewers. In the meantime her language keeps getting better and better. In a recent tweet she responded to sarcasm with: “… ‘ .. if ever language betrayed desperation of loser, it is here…” Losers or not, with over 70% of the votes polled, Barkha is the absolute winner here. Cheers!



2014:

Barkha finally falls off her top perch. She topped the pile in the last two editions but then BD has fallen of every perch she’s been on. One of the biggest blows to her must be that RahulG preferred Arnab Goswami to her for his first ever TV interview. All her years of carefully “evoluting” the Gandhi has ended in misery. She also campaigned for SheilaD by moderating her Google hangout; but SheilaD too lost as did Congress in Delhi. Overall BD has been far more subdued in the last year or so but hasn’t failed to maintain her bitchiness or her sense of grandeur about herself. She thrilled when Hartosh Bal was sacked from Open Magazine because he had spanked her badly over the Radiagate episode. She couldn’t help telling the world over and over again how she was reporting from the “North Lawns” of the White House. She screwed up over the “Dehati Aurat” incident and then claimed the story was being made “about her”. She didn’t forget to bitch about a reporter from TimesNow in her reporting from the “Keran Sector”. To add to her misery her frequent darlings have also been in trouble. Musharraf is more in jail than out. Imran Khan got a smackdown in the Pak elections. Poor thing! Nothing is going right for ‘Lady Iamthenews’.",2016-02-23 21:03:19

The general populace does not care about intricacies of FoS and autonomy of a university. They see a bunch of people protesting against the nation and cheering the enemy, an enemy which is directly responsible for deaths of our soldiers - and they see a ""strong"" Modi government countering such forces.

263,"Mainstream left, or centrist left, has moved from Democratic Socialism to Social Democracy. Which basically means that instead of moving means of production to government control for public good (like Nehru-Indira-Rajiv years), they want production to be private but government revenues to be used for social good (like post reform years).

This is a good trend, and I believe that any country needs to cycle through both left and right leaning governments to achieve a good balance. If you have too many years on the right, you end up like US. Capitalism on steroids. If you have too many years on the left, you end up like Venezuela: broke despite being very rich in resources.

To balance out 60+ years of Socialism, India desperately needs to swing right, but not too hard. BJP is just about right amount of swing and velocity.

&gt; * Reservation agitations of various kinds will also bubble up to the surface; as the Uttar Pradesh elections approach, Dalit bodies will start demanding reservations in promotions in central and state services, and various other castes will demand backward status.

&gt; * Right now it is easy for every state government to blame the centre for the lack of resources of powers, when most important subjects (law and order, agriculture, health, etc) with them; every city government can blame both centre and state as mayors have become ceremonial offices.

&gt; * Above all, Modi has to place the key connecting theme in all this: India has to become a strong state that can achieve law and order through normal laws and not draconian ones.

&gt; * But in recent times, more often than her administrative decisions, the methods that AIADMK workers and leaders adopt to prove their loyalty to Puratchi Thalaivi (Revolutionary Leader) Jayalalithaa have given way to criticism.

&gt; * So as the leader celebrates her birthday today, we take a look at some of the instances in the past where AIADMK workers and leaders have displayed new levels of steadfast support to their leader.

&gt; * When Chennai and the rest of Tamil Nadu was ravaged by devastating floods, the stickling reminder to the antics of the AIADMK workers were perhaps the pictures that went viral on social media.

&gt; * Stretching things onto a whole new level, more on the funnier side though, party workers and leaders went on to tonsure their heads for their beloved leader.

It is not as bad as it could be. Like you I do not support BJP. I think their ideology is regressive. However, I think things have turned out to be far better than I had feared. Before the elections I heard the speeches of Narendra Modi and I found them quite eloquent. My worse fear was that the government would try to implement the sangh ideology by stealth and people would not realize what is happening till it is too late. So I would like to thank all the sangh people who made all the stupid statements. ",2016-02-25 00:20:36
302,"Because too many politicians have PM aspirations. 

Look 2014 Lok Sabha elections, we had Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi as the major PM candidates. 

We also had Nitish Kumar, J Jayalalitha, Sharad Pawar and Mayawait who would've wanted to be PM. They certainly consider themselves to be major players and would've wanted to on a TV debate. 

The next question is language. Who decides what language the debate will be in? Jayalalitha wouldn't want it to be in Hindi. I think all the names i mentioned are English speakers but what would the point of a debate in English be? 

Lastly, its would make for poor television. Look at the Republican and Democratic debates, all the speakers except Carson are good orators, none of our candidates are. 

TV also has a very small audience in India compared to the US, it wouldn't be worth their time to have multiple TV debates before an election.",2016-02-25 00:24:02

So far this fat cow has succeeded in driving one student to suicide and imprisoning three others based on fake videos. What else can you expect from a soap opera actress. Madarchod Modi. Fucker is going to destroy the country in five years. Hope everyone who voted for the 'achche din' is enjoying it.

Just wow. You called her a retard just because she acted in a TV serial. You know who else did that? A sly as fuck politician from Bihar - Sharad Yadav - 'I know who you are!'. That same breed who you hate so rabidly on randia. You called her a cow? If a size zero model would have given this same speech, you'd have probably attacked her with adjectives like 'bulimic' or 'malnourished'. Calling the PM a motherfucker and dismissing a minister as a TV soap opera actress without basing your objections on facts is simply incredible. As of my writing, your comment has a score of 30, which means more than 30 randian alts have upvoted your comment.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: With an aim to discourage cash transactions, the Cabinet today approved withdrawal of surcharge service charge and convenience fee on card and digital payments.The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved mandating payments beyond a prescribed threshold only through a card or digital mode.

&gt; * ""The essential features of the proposals for promotion of payments through cards and digital means include steps for withdrawal of surcharge, service charge and convenience fee on card and digital payments currently imposed by various government departments, organisations...,"" according to an official statement.

&gt; * ""The promotion of payments through cards and digital means will be instrumental in reducing tax avoidance, migration of government payments and collections to cashless mode,"" it added.

&gt; * The move primarily discourages transactions in cash by providing access to financial payment services to citizens to pay through cards and digital means and shifting payment ecosystem from cash dominated to non-cash or less cash payments, the statement said.Among other measures aimed at reducing cash transactions include rationalisation of Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on card transactions and a differentiated MDR framework for some key segments.Other features include introduction of formula-linked acceptance infrastructure by the stakeholders of certain card products, rationalisation of telecom service charges for digital financial transactions and promotion of mobile banking.Creation of necessary assurance mechanisms for quick resolution of fraudulent transactions and reviewing the payments ecosystem in the country have also been approved.Several short-term (to be implemented within one year) and medium-term measures (two years) for implementation by the government ministries, departments and organisations were approved, the statement added.

&gt;* Soon after being sworn in, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had started keeping close tabs on the ""negative"" media stories about his government.

&gt;* However, sources said, this is the first time that ministries have been asked to submit compliance reports on the action taken about the negative news stories in the media.

&gt;* However, sources said as there was no established mechanism to deal with the situation, it was decided that the PIB would compile an action taken report and submit it to the PMO every day.

&gt;* The comments of the respective ministry or department mentioned in the ""negative"" news report have been made mandatory, sources said.

312,"&gt;Rahul Gandhi never visits one spot twice. I.e - once his political motive in that area is complete he gives zero fucks abou that area

That's par for the course for all politicians. They only visit places that benefit them politically.

Smriti Irani regularly visits Amethi because it's beneficial for her politicially to target Rahul Gandhi. 

How often does she visit other places for follow up? Ditto for Modi/Kejriwal/Didi/Amma/Mayawati etc.

&gt;Students in various state boards are taught about anti national stuff. A 6th class book says that Kashmir state is fighting against tyranny of Indian military 

We have all kinds of inaccurate crap in our textbooks. Doesn't take a Smriti Irani to point that out. 

BJP run states are filling the textbooks with even more crap. Here's one from Gujarat.

http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-gujarat-textbooks-hail-hitler-1035792

&gt;&gt;Germany's infamous dictator continues to be glorified in social science textbooks printed by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks. 

&gt;&gt;The first chapter of the Class IX textbook titled 'Present Currents of World History' states that ""Hitler led the Germans towards ardent nationalism"". The chapter further says that ""in the thinking of Nazism, there is coordination of nationalism and socialism"".

&gt;&gt;The director of Prashant, Father Cedric Prakash, told DNA, ""Some schools may not be teaching that particular chapter, but students would read it anyway. Moreover, nowhere is it mentioned that Hitler was 'cruel'. There is no mention of the Holocaust."" 

IMO this is a far more dangerous precedent, because kids are being taught of Nazi ideology as a good thing.

&gt;In telangana's protests 100's of students died. Why no media or political attention to that?

Where was she living then? There was plenty of media and political attention. That's pretty much what led to AP bifurcation.

But none of them killed themselves because they were targetted for special harassment by a local leader and central govt. ministers. In Rohith's case Smriti Irani wrote a letter to the VC explicitly requesting for action to be taken against him and his group.

&gt; 4.the vc and the faculty of the University where rohith studied was appointed by Congress,. Why didn't they call back him? 

She's exposing her own bias here. Just because a VC was appointed by someone they should be blindly loyal to that person and do their bidding eternally? 

Faculty in universities are not political appointments, they are recruited by the university via competitive exams and such.


&gt;If rahul Gandhi had said jnu's some students are blurting out anti national slogans but there are thousands more from the same University who fight till the last breath for our country,

Why would Rahul Gandhi or any other politician  with half a brain make such a statement? Unless someone was present at JNU when the slogans were supposedly raised, there is no way of knowing what slogans were raised and by whom. 

All that we know right now  is that whatever evidence of sloganeering that BJP based it's whole attack on JNU and Kanhaiya has been thoroughly discredited.

&gt;* To show a better Operating Ratio, the Railways Minister made a grossly undervalued provision of Rs 5,500 crore as Depreciation Reserve Fund (DRF) for the 2015-16 fiscal.

&gt;* This was nothing but fudging of numbers amounting to misleading the country on the actual financial health of the railways, Trivedi said in his letter to Modi, dated February 23.

&gt;* Charging the Union minister of having done a copy-paste of his 2012-13 budget speech  including the investment proposal of Rs 8 lakh crore in the 12th plan period  Trivedi blamed Prabhu for having failed to understand the implementation priorities.

&gt;* Not the ambitious 8.5 lakh crore Capital expenditure plan over the next five years, not the gloating about 360 degrees transformation of railways nor the Thumbs Up sign from JICA for a bullet train can hide the dark underbelly of growing concerns about the sharp deteriorating operating performance and financial health of the organisation, Trivedi said.

&gt;* Next fiscal, the veil of window dressing of accounts will get completely lifted as  after the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations  the organisation will suffer an operating cash loss of Rs 32,000 crore.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday urged the Supreme Court to lift its ban on IPL teams Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Rajasthan Royals , on the ground that the PIL petitioner had colluded with former IPL chief Lalit Modi to mislead the Lodha panel against former chairman N Srinivasan and now suspended teams CSK and Rajasthan Royals.Swamy claimed that Modi had, after fleeing authorities in India, colluded with Cricket Association of Bihar secretary Aditya Verma to influence the course of events in the Bombay High Court and later the top court, culminating in the suspension of the two teams from the tournament for two years.Verma was only a proxy for Modi, Swamy said, quoting press reports and purported emails exchanged between incumbent Shashank Manohar, Verma and Modi.

&gt; * He mentioned in his plea, on an urgent out of turn basis in the court of Chief Justice of India TS Thakur and Justice UU Lalit, which said it would come up with the other BCCI cases in court next week and also sought a stay on the Lodha panel report.The top court has sought the BCCI and the IPL teams' responses to sweeping changes suggested by the Lodha panel to clean up the game in India.Swamy claimed that Verma's entire litigation against the BCCI was financed by Modi who allegedly held beneficial interest in the IPL teams himself and could by no stretch of imagination be termed as a PIL.

&gt; * ""These emails confirm the statements in the news reports and show that the entire proceedings, beginning from the PIL before the High Court and which ultimately culminated in the suspension of CSK and RR, was targeted and is tainted by unclean hands, being a proxy litigation at the behest of vested interests.

&gt; * Swamy claimed he had more information about others who helped Modi in bringing Srinivasan's downfall and offered to submit it in a sealed cover.CSK, Swamy claimed, was the single most popular and successful IPL team and stood ""unfairly suspended"" from the IPL because of the motivated legal campaign against it.""...

How dare such posts be upvoted and shit!! How dare our strength of downvoting be overpowered in randia!!! 

Now, let me refute the points.

1. Why does it always have to be about RaGa? Is it because of the pet peeve of Modi that all his cohorts feel it to be eternally hung up on him, right down to the internet trolls always harping on him? IS it BJP in power or someone else here. Already its been pointed out that he has visited other places twice. So what if he visited this place twice? Ofcourse he has a political motive just like how the BJP has - Did Amit shah and crew land upon Bihar to do social service for Swacch Bharat?

2. 6th class book from which state? Which board was it? I never recall studying such in my 6th class when Congress was in power. So if its changed identify and set it right rather than crying hoarse here to stoke passions. Again she's reacting rather than taking actions. Also why isn't mandatory to teach the truth about Kashmir rather than feeding lies in textbooks? Has she raged about this aspect ever?

3. If you're gonna compare two irrelevant issues, let's compare Jat reservations also into the mix then. Why did your government take such stern action on some doctored video tapes but just bowing down to Jat's demands? Why didn't you take a firm stand against those Jat even if it means against reservations? She read out aloud those names of the students who are the kingpins - how about telling us how you got the complaint against them? Who got the complaint to your attention with those names? Why not shout out those names too?

4. Why is it that this government is always about 'either you're with us or against India'? Why is not ok to have differing opinions? Why should anyone even fight till last breath for this country? Just being born into a country is no reason to be patriotic. If I'm patriotic doesn't mean I expect everyone to be patriotic. Its a democracy and everyone is entitled to their opinion.

&gt;* Modi's silence on unforeseen events contrasts with his reputation as an effective communicator, through rousing speeches and social media, when broadcasting his vision of inclusive growth and development for India's 1.3 billion people.

&gt;* After the arrest for sedition of Kanhaiya Kumar, a student leader in New Delhi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh circulated a fake tweet that falsely suggested a campus protest had the support of a notorious Pakistani militant.

&gt;* Delhi's police chief showed no remorse when officers failed to prevent lawyers manhandling Kumar in court, while education minister Smriti Irani backed a decision to fly Indian flags, from 207-foot (63-metre) flagpoles, on campuses across the country as a reminder to ""anti-national"" elements.

&gt;* A spokesman for Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is from Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, said he was determined to address the legitimate demands of the Jat community, while those responsible for the violence would be punished.

&gt; * In fact, the only headline that the ""Make in India"" event made was the fire on the stage.

&gt; * No attempt was made, by either action or word, to change the headlines and push them back to Mumbai.

&gt; * A faculty committee of the university that reviewed the agreement with the foundation, has decided to drop plans for two chairs in Hinduism and Indian studies immediately and review two other chairs, one in Sikhism and the other in Jainism, which totals another $3 million.

&gt; * But the faculty review committee has decided that the grant from the foundation was not acceptable.

&gt; * One of the stated objectives of the foundation was to have Hindus studying Hinduism, because it thought non-Hindu scholars were misrepresenting the religion  a point that came in for particular opposition from the academic community.

Not denying that at all. I don't think that has ever been in dispute for the vast majority of people. (Except for some brainwashed folk who still claim she was an innocent student etc.)

My point is this chap claims IB asked them to plan the operation and then IB executed them in an extra-judicial killing. 

If the objective of the IB plan was to kill the LeT operatives, and they had a mole letting them know what the plans were.. then the assassination of Modi/others was not one the IB's agenda at all.

&gt;It was a joint operation between the IB and the police forces of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat, where some cops from Gujarat did the actual encounter. 

But cops from Gujarat report to and take orders from the Home Minister of Gujarat and not the IB. 

What most people are pissed about is that these people were killed in a staged encounter. And the theory being pushed was the fake encounter was approved by Amit Shah. 

But if the Home Secy's statement is right and ""we killed them"", then the IB is violating state's control of their own police department which is a huge violation of the separation of powers.

Otherwise, it would have been trivial for Amit Shah to claim that the orders to kill them came from IB and turned the tables on the central govt.. But in all these years he has said nothing of that sort.

395,"2) I think everyone in India is expecting tax relief. And i think the government is going to restructure the tax slabs. 

Service tax increase is to prepare for GST that will be introduced. 

1) If GST is indeed introduced at 18%, it will be quite a jump from the current levels. So, the government has taken a good economic decision to prepare for GST introduction by raising the service tax. 

3) Increasing excise on oil is a decent decision. I am not saying it's a good decision because it does not transfer the benefit to the public but actually it's a good economic decision. Raghuram rajan agrees that this is a good time to increase the excise duty. If opposition parties are criticizing the government for not transferring the benefit to the people, they are taking a myopic view of the country's economy. 
As a common man, yes i feel hard done by. But, i try to convince myself saying it's good for the economy. 

4) Haha. I am suffering losses too. But, it's not due to Modi growth story, rather that is due to world economy slow down. The initial hyperbole has waned off, but that every investor expected. 

All in all, the common man is not too happy. But, it's only going to improve from here.

While all this was going on Congress started fucking up hard. Scam after scam, shitty statements one after another.

By the time they got re-elected we were in a collective ""wtf"" and decided we should be more active participants to keep the real anti-nationals, Congress, out of power.

And that's how we hope to keep it.

As for Nehru, this is not a CMV, and I'm not interested in your weak excuses for him. India needed Patel, and what little we had of him makes up for multiple Nehrus.

&gt;* Despite the storm around him  the intolerance debate, the defeat in Bihar, the Rohith Vemula suicide, the JNU crisis  he remains the unchallenged No 1.

&gt;* Under Modi, the PMO has become the epicentre of all important, and some not-so-important, decisions, with the ministries often being bypassed, the list says.

&gt;* The impromptu decision the Prime Minister took to stop-over in Lahore on his way home from Afghanistan to meet Nawaz Sharif was considered a clever diplomatic move and surprised geopolitical scientists.

So, the BJP must first explain why it allowed the nation to sacrifice 2 percentage points of additional GDP over the last 4 to 5 years. If the BJP had cooperated with the Manmohan Singh government, the GST would have been operational by 2012.

On top it of they've let inflation get out of hand in many key areas especially food. 

On top of it GDP is more or less where it was under the UPA. As is job growth. Manufacturing is actually worse. 

In fact according to Ruchir Sharma the government has become more protectionist not less. 

In its latest salvo to foreign investors after attempting to implement the MAT they're now threatening to seize vodafone's assets. What message is that sending to investors?

The recent Make in India summit majority of people who attended were locals not foreigners. And if people remember 21000 MOU's including 1 lakh crore worth of projects were signed by Ambani in Gujarat, and none of them transferred into investment. The same thing is going to happen here.

In fact it will get worse because all that hope will now be crushed by an inept government which Arun Shourie warned about when he said the government lacks talent and Modi being paranoid has turned the PMO into an autocratic institution.

&gt;* ""The complainant alleged that when CBI had raided the Chief Minister's Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar's Delhi Secretariat office on December 15 last year, Kejriwal made offensive remarks on his Twitter account against Modi.

&gt;* ""Being fully aware of the autonomy and independence of the CBI, the accused (Kejriwal) owing to his personal interest and political enmity, made some offending remarks on his Twitter account towards the Prime Minister of this country, just because of the said raid by the CBI,"" the complaint said.

432,"The relationship as of now seems to be getting back to normal with Nepal. With Myanmar, It was just a PR fail. Nothing bad happened on field.

Nepal: The govt of Nepal had passed a constitution. There were serious doubts about the inclusiveness of it, and also it possibly couldn't bring the representative democracy, it had promised. 
The Madhesis and Tharus, people who live in the plains, Janajatis(indigenous people), and women were mostly discriminated. The political boundaries were drawn so that the upper caste people of the hills would maintain their power status.

This obviously irked those people and they started demonstrations, and didn't allow vehicles to pass through the border. It is alleged that the Indian govt took this opportunity to point out to the elites that they should have listened to the advise of the Indian govt, and written a constitution that was inclusive of all people, and a constitution that would have consensus from all across the society.

I don't think the relations are that fucked up, because everybody expected the new PM of Nepal to visit China first, signalling the breakdown of relations with India, but he visited India first as is the tradition for any elected leader. Also, India is a major partner in a lot of economic projects, and also has announced a $250 million to help rebuild Nepal. If anything that should send across the signal, that the relationship is good.

Myanmar: If you remember very well, last year the Indian Army completed a combing operation of militant groups inside the borders of Myanmar. Our govt officials and Media were chest thumping that our men crossed into another country and killed the enemy. Realistically, it should have been kept a secret. Or, we should have been more transparent and as soon as the op got over, we should have let Myanmar announce the feat, and take the credit. Our leaders were chest thumping, and then Myanmar obviously had to deny that their sovereignty was violated. 

It was probably resolved through the diplomatic channels, and no major screwing up has been done lately on Myanmar front. Also, Myanmar had elections, and the party of Aung Suu Kyi won the elections, which is a good thing, because she has close relation with India, and Modi even visited her, when she was in the political opposition. She even talked of helping resolve issues between China and India.

All in all, the relations with these countries are good. These relations cannot be broken by one bad govt(Not saying about NDA/UPA, but in general). If it was something, then, it was just a minor hiccup.

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Dalit student Rohith Vemula's mother on Friday launched a scathing attack on HRD minister Smriti Irani, accusing her of resorting to ""blatant lies"" while talking in Parliament about her son's suicide and that ""life imprisonment"" will not be enough for her and others ""responsible"" for his death.Radhika Vemula, flanked by her other son Raja, said BJP will be ""decimated to the ground"" if Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not take any action against Irani and her ministerial colleague Bandaru Dattatreya who had written multiple letters to her seeking action against Rohith, alleging anti-national activities.

&gt;* Irani has lied multiple times while speaking on the issue in Parliament.

&gt;* she said in a news conference.Speaking in Parliament, Irani had on Wednesday tried to deflect criticism and mounted a strident attack on the opposition accusing it of ""politicizing"" the PhD scholar's death.She had said that the committee which acted against Rohith had a dalit representative and that doctors were not allowed to revive him after he was found hanging.Rohith's brother Raja dubbed Irani's comments as ""blatant lies"", saying he reached the campus by 8.30pm and saw police and doctors where his body was kept.

&gt;* ""Even life imprisonment will not be enough for the ministers, vice-chancellor and the ABVP activists who were responsible for my son's death.

&gt;* We demand formation of an SIT to probe the case,"" Radhika said.Rohith's friend Prashant, who was also expelled by the Hyderabad University, cited minutes of the executive council meeting of Hyderabad University, claiming that action was taken against them ""in response"" to communication from the HRD ministry to not allow the students to continue academic activities.26-year-old Rohith was found hanging at a hostel room in the university on January 17, days after punitive action was taken against him and four other students for allegedly attacking an ABVP functionary.Students and Rohith's family have been alleging that Irani and Dattatreya had forced the university to take action against him and others.The duty doctor at the University of Hyderabad on Thursday contradicted Irani's claim that no doctor was allowed near the body to revive him.Prashant said Irani must be punished for misleading the nation and giving a false statement in Parliament which is ""an offence"" under the Constitution.

Worship of durga is more prevalent in East and among tribals across India. Vishnu and Shiva are popular in upper caste Hindus in South and North. 

Asurs are a small tribe of 10,000. Not sure if anyone recorded their origins. If we are to believe that these were the asurs in Hindu mythology, then are yadevs from Krishna's clan?

4. Modi - Under Modi's term, the incremental borrowing has practically shrunk. They have no legislative control on the banks, as the banks report into the RBI from a regulatory standpoint. Bank appointees coming from Fin Secy is the only tangential link. Could Modi merge and privatize all these banks? Sure, that is something that I hope they do!

About the Muslims, why did the karsevaks go to ayodhya? Because of what abv has a huge hand in starting ten years ago. Why did they make anti Muslim slogans throughout the journey? Why were there reports of LPG cylinder and swords getting collected at vhp members houses since at least one and a half years ago? Who do the karsevaks and bjp think they are, i'd be angry enough to do any thing to someone whose singing songs of genociding my group throughout a journey too. Who allowed that? The trigger was molesting the Muslim girl at the previous station (vadodra? I have no clu and not important). 

ABv was the PM, he needed to send the force in ASAP, he knew what modi was up to when he hurriedly came on live TV in the evening and declared it a terrorist act without absolutely no evidence, and paraded the bodies in ahmedavad for no fucking reason. And its a myth that he asked for help from neighboring states because that's not how it works. States dont have any resources to help other states, except police, and Gujarat had no lack of police personnel given the situation. Army is under the center, not states. Even then, stares never help each other because they're not capable, only centre is. And the surrounding states are all bjp anyway. Abv was a smart man, he knew what was happening all along. Like he knew what was happening all along at babri. 

Were abv's intentions good? Noone cares, I'm sure Hitler wanted to usher a new scienfitifc and the technological age also. Intentions don't matter, leaders of countries don't get that leeway. And about that press conference I'm not sure if abv was doing anything an incumbent pm about to appear for re elections in a year wouldn't do. He was no saint man, inaction in a position of power is as much a crime according to law as perpetration.

We never needed to have nukes, never. In a country of the world one third poor, the word 'need' for nukes is kinda offensive. We wanted them, sure, but need? No, we need food and water and oxygen, we *want* candy and shiny clothes and GI Joe action figures. Pakistan attacked as soon as they had nukes. Remember, how many terrorist attacks we had before 98, and how many have happened after. Whos going to pay for their ambition to show the world shiny new toys rather than improve the conditions of the country's needy. India shining campaign? That one term of bjp, and India is fucked for good. 

I actually don't think godse was worse than abv, he was a man in turbulent times and also kind of crazy. Abv was a sensible, intelligent PM in a time of growing economic prosperity who broke someone's mosque and I'd credited with starting every Hindu Muslim conflict we have seen ever since 91 or will see in the future.

&gt; * This was challenged by way of a petition in 2000 as violative of the right to equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution and also democracy, both part of the basic structure of the Constitution.The petition had been pending with the top court for years.

&gt; * On Friday, the bench decided to examine it afresh, although the central government contended that it had become infructuous over time.When the matter was referred to the Constitution bench, lawyers for petitioner Ashok Kumar Jain and many others had said in their preliminary arguments that such amendments were violative of the basic feature of the Constitution.They had contended that democracy had been declared to be an essential feature of the Constitution by the court.

&gt; * But let's consider the idea behind protective discrimination as is prevalent in the country, and how it has been sacrificed at the altar of populism, and in that backdrop, debate whether the Jats deserve the reservations that they have been agitating for.

&gt; * The stand by the current Haryana and Union governments has given the Jats hope again, but more reservation in Haryana is expected to fail judicial scrutiny, because there is already 50 per cent reservation in government jobs in the state, and that's the ceiling imposed by the Supreme Court.

&gt; * So going strictly by secular considerations, Jats, as a caste group, don't merit reservation, which proves the fallacy of caste-based protective discrimination.

&gt; * It is here perhaps worthwhile to point out that caste-based reservations can't usher in a casteless society, for firstly, the caste mentality is too well-ingrained in our minds and then, such reservations reinforce that mentality, by giving undue importance to caste.

&gt; * What's more, the seven departments of IIT Kgp, that are working on the project, are tracing the different stages through which the civilisation has progressed and has yet been able to maintain its continuity as a living civilisation, unlike comparable ancient civilisations around the world.The project, which is completely funded by the union ministry of human resources development, has attracted the attention of none less than Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who made it a point to explore its progress on Sunday at Varanasi, when he met the IIT Kgp faculty members and inquired about the possibilities and the scope of the project.The results that have come from a detailed geo exploration through the GPS conducted through 100 metre deep bore holes all over Varanasi shows continuous settlement history till 2000 BC.

&gt; * The indicators are that at the end of data collection, this will be put back another '1500 years to establish the final habitable antiquity of Varanasi at 4500 BC.The geo-exploration, that is being conducted jointly with the British Geological Survey, has already established the existence of Naimisharanya, a forest that finds mention in the Vedas and in the Kashipurana.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Proficiency in Hindi can now earn central government employees up to Rs 10,000 each in prize money if they score at least 70 per cent marks in the examination conducted at the completion of the 'Parangat' course introduced by the Narendra Modi government last year to promote use of the official language among bureaucrats.The home ministry, in a letter to all central ministries on Wednesday, proposed the payout as ""encouragement"" for employees undertaking the government's toughest Hindi proficiency course.

&gt; * The ministry proposed that the employees scoring 60-69 per cent marks be paid Rs 8,000 while those securing 55-59 per cent marks be paid Rs 6,000.The government had introduced the 160-hour course in April 2015 after it found that many officers were unable to carry out official work in Hindi despite passing training courses offered by the Centre such as Prabodh, Praveen and Pragya.

&gt; * The higher-level Parangat course is mainly based on practice, with as much as 80 per cent of the time scheduled for practice while the rest is kept aside for discussing theoretical aspects.In its letter, a copy of which has been seen by ET, the home ministry said that the ministries and departments to which the high-scoring employees belong will bear the expense from their own administrative budget and asked for their comments by March 10.Officials said the total payout could be significant since all central government employees possessing ""working knowledge of Hindi"" are supposed to undertake the Parangat course in batches.The course includes topics such as administration, finance, banking, science and technology, and glossary of terms.Employees are given a choice of completing the course in one go over 20 days and 160 hours of training or over five months with a one-hour training on alternate days.

How Modi is Changing India [P]:

- This, in turn, is because India is being fundamentally changed by an inter-play of three dominant forces at work in the country today: Modi, Rajan and technology.

- The economic impacts of these resets
The cost of borrowing in India is one of the highest amongst emerging markets.

- Even after adjusting for inflation, the real cost of borrowing remains one of the highest in India.

- Banking and financial services commands the highest weight in the Sensex (31 per cent) followed by IT (16 per cent).

- Finally, the entry of 23 new banks is likely to squeeze the RoEs of existing banks.

CPI which is the real measure of inflation, which the RBI agrees with too, is up. 

Secondly take the example of Modi's attack on black money , what complete crap. Modi has done absolutely nothing to tackle black money in real estate. In fact they've made it easier to invest with black money from foreign sources using REITS.  The real estate bill under the UPA had a clause where idle properties would be taxed - Modi removed this clause after lobbying of the builders. If he didn't property prices would have corrected. 

This idea that we are no longer lead by companies in the stock market is complete crap too. Private investment continues to fall every quarter. If anything large caps are the only thing keeping the country's investment alive. 

The lack of demand and top line growth is affecting everyone go look at rural demand and you'll see its weaker than ever.

The last part about how Modi doesn't seek rent is complete crap. Look at all the people who have gotten contracts . Adani, Ambani, Tata, Mittal , Mahindra. To understand how Modi's corruption works watch for these people to 'legally' pay back Modi when the elections start via the profits from their PPP government contracts after exploiting India and its resources.
