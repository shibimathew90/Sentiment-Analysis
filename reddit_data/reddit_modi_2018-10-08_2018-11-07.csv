Some Info I could collect from online sources:

French supported us:- 

&gt;In January 1998, President Jacques Chirac visited India with a high-level delegation. Following the Indian nuclear tests of May 1998, Chirac even publicly supported New Delhi and opposed US sanctions.

US was quite isolated on the issue:-

&gt;U.S. is working with Sweden and Britain, as well as Japan and China, on a resolution to be adopted by the United Nations Security Council, condemning the Indian government and urging it to join the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

&gt;Britain, France and Russia have all said they will not impose sanctions and Germany has remained non-committal.

So, is Modi bullshitting here? Russia and Britain also supported us. Either he must know more due to his position, or he also gets his info from WhatsApp level sources. 

Also, Pakistan nuclear ambitions were helped by French too. 

&gt;In 1976, France and Pakistan signed the highly controversial agreement on the construction of the 100 MT facility that could have separated between 100 kg and 200 kg of plutonium per year (a warhead or bomb can be built with a few kilograms, depending on its quality). The project was terminated in 1978 following massive pressure by the U.S. administration under President Carter. However, the advancement of the project most likely had already included the transmission of blueprints that helped Pakistan, probably with some Chinese assistance, to acquire an operational reprocessing capacity.",2018-10-08 13:37:00

**Did Reliance Defence (as on 20-Apr-2015, yet to commence its commercial operations), or the listed company it acquired, Pipavav (as on 20-Apr-2015, intended to enter into biz such as defence systems + aerospace), ever produce a part relating to defence-aircraft, by the time Narendra Modi sealed Rafale order with Dassault, on 10-Apr-2015?**

***

Here is the circular from Competition Commission of India dated 20-Apr-2015: **https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/C-2015-04-261_0.pdf**

&gt; The proposed combination relates to **acquisition of at least 25.1 percent equity shares of Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company Limited (""Pipavav"") by Reliance Defence**, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited (""Reliance Infra‚Äù).


&gt; **Pipavav is a listed, public limited company** incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and is currently engaged in the **business of defence shipbuilding, commercial shipbuilding, offshore construction and refurbishment**. Further, it also intends to enter into businesses such as, heavy engineering, defence compact systems, manufacturing of tanks and aerospace. It has **five subsidiaries and one joint venture company, out of which only one subsidiary**, namely, E Complex Private Limited, which is **engaged in the business of development of special economic zones, has commenced commercial operations**. 


&gt; Based on the information provided by the Parties, there is no horizontal overlap between the products/services of the Parties. While Pipavav is active in the defence sector, manufacturing of commercial ships and repair of oil rigs; Reliance Infra is an active player in the infrastructure sector and **Reliance Defence is yet to commence its commercial operations**. Further, none of the group companies of Reliance Infra are active in the sectors wherein Pipavav is active.

Why?

&gt;No. Humans and animals haven't agreed to form a society.

That's why you leave them by themselves and not interfere in their eco systems. Its already messed up.

&gt; You tell me. Why do people eat animals? Why are animals enslaved to serve their masters for life- give milk, carry weights, pull wagons etc.? Does that also sound like ""slavery back then"" to you? 

Exactly you get my point. 

&gt; Yes we do whatever is necessary for our survival and beyond. So what's your point? 

as said by in other comment u/gluewhale ""Apparently humans don't follow this law. We seem to only believe in survival of the entitled.""

&gt;What do you mean by ""How can you?"". I just did. 

Not a nice way to argue. You need to be more elaborate with your reasoning.

&gt;All animals are not homogeneous. Both humans and animals have a certain degree of ""free will"" and a ""natural instinct"".

I am not a expert but I assume you are not one either. So our discussion is based on known relevant facts. 

Next when you are hungry you will think what food to choose and where to find it, I am sure you will not barge into random persons house. A wild animal will find its food based on instincts. For a tiger flesh is flesh. It will hunt only when it is hungry or threatened, it will never hunt for entertainment or fun.

&gt;So what? Are you saying that an individual behaving as per it's natural instinct should be left as it is? Does it apply to psychopathic murders too? After all it's their natural instinct. 

Ok here you missed the point. You can't compare a wild animal with a human. if your answer is again ""I just did."" then sorry I am sorry for wasting your time.

&gt; There is no reason to have a responsibilty. Like give one reason to care about nature outside your own goodwill and your own survival. You may out of your goodwill but not at the cost of human survival. 

Don't understand what you want to convey here. Its quite basic I guess, mess up with the eco system and wrath will come to you. Anyways if you are not interested to be responsible then that is the way it is. Even leaders like Trump and Modi are hell bent to destroy nature. Collectively we are doomed anyways.

&gt;Great. Then convince fellow humans of not domesticating animals, not eating them. Anything affecting human survival comes. 

I do that with my friends and family. Part of nature protection groups. Hope I can make some changes and bring some awareness among people like you. ",2018-10-09 17:20:39

71,"Questions to ask, after perusing Govt of India's circular pertaining to 'Reliance - Pipavav' deal:

***

**Did Reliance Defence (as on 20-Apr-2015, yet to commence its commercial operations), or the listed company it acquired, Pipavav (as on 20-Apr-2015, intended to enter into biz such as defence systems + aerospace), ever produce a part relating to defence-aircraft, by the time Narendra Modi sealed Rafale order with Dassault, on 10-Apr-2015?**

***

Here is the circular from Competition Commission of India dated 20-Apr-2015: **https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/C-2015-04-261_0.pdf**

&gt; The proposed combination relates to **acquisition of at least 25.1 percent equity shares of Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company Limited (""Pipavav"") by Reliance Defence**, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited (""Reliance Infra‚Äù).


&gt; **Pipavav is a listed, public limited company** incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and is currently engaged in the **business of defence shipbuilding, commercial shipbuilding, offshore construction and refurbishment**. Further, it also intends to enter into businesses such as, heavy engineering, defence compact systems, manufacturing of tanks and aerospace. It has **five subsidiaries and one joint venture company, out of which only one subsidiary**, namely, E Complex Private Limited, which is **engaged in the business of development of special economic zones, has commenced commercial operations**. 


&gt; Based on the information provided by the Parties, there is no horizontal overlap between the products/services of the Parties. While Pipavav is active in the defence sector, manufacturing of commercial ships and repair of oil rigs; Reliance Infra is an active player in the infrastructure sector and **Reliance Defence is yet to commence its commercial operations**. Further, none of the group companies of Reliance Infra are active in the sectors wherein Pipavav is active.

On Narendra Modi announcing the deal with Dassault:

&gt; [**India orders 36 French-made Rafale fighter jets - PM Modi**, 10th Apr 2015](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-france-rafale/india-orders-36-french-made-rafale-fighter-jets-pm-modi-idUSKBN0N10R020150410)",2018-10-09 21:53:41

74,"&gt;Why?

That's what I m saying. Why does there need to be such a rule?

&gt;That's why you leave them by themselves and not interfere in their eco systems. Its already messed up.

That's not a reason to leave them. I get that you must be thinking that why would I not want to leave them alone but my point is simply that it's not a reason to leave them alone. If it's in human interest, there is no reason to.

&gt;Exactly you get my point. 

In case, you agree with me that it's like a slavery and human being eating animals isn't right, I don't have much points to make. I don't agree with you but I can't counter you also, yours is one way of approach to life. I appreciate that at least you aren't being hypocritical by justifying eating animals and domesticating them while simultaneously denying that human interests are superior.


&gt;Not a nice way to argue. You need to be more elaborate with your reasoning.

No, I meant that why can't I compare the two. The guy just wrote that one acts 'naturally' and other of his 'free will'. But what I meant was ""So what? How does that make a difference?"" I was elaborate with my reasoning with the example of psychopath (which you addressed just after).

&gt;Ok here you missed the point. You can't compare a wild animal with a human. if your answer is again ""I just did."" then sorry I am sorry for wasting your time.

But why not? I mean I know that humans and animals aren't the same but nor are apple and oranges. But I can compare apples and oranges if I want to see applicability of Newton's law of motion on them. So, what is the reason that I can't compare humans with animals **in the context of their behaviour being natural or out of free will**. Note that the other guy differentiated between the two (humans and animals) on the basis of free will and natural instinct. But my point was that some humans have natural instinct too. If you don't want me to compare animals with humans then you need to expand your logic beyond it simply being a case of free will or natural instinct.

&gt;Don't understand what you want to convey here. Its quite basic I guess, mess up with the eco system and wrath will come to you. Anyways if you are not interested to be responsible then that is the way it is. Even leaders like Trump and Modi are hell bent to destroy nature. Collectively w are doomed anyways.

Exactly my point. Human saves 'nature' only because of two reasons. One, to protect himself of the consequence (selfishness), two due to simply a goodwill towards animals and plants (altruism). The first one appeals to selfishness of humans and the second one doesn't apply if human interests and animal interests are in conflict. So, finally the human will will (two wills) prevail in case of conflict.


&gt;I do that with my friends and family. Part of nature protection groups. Hope I can make some changes and bring some awareness among people like you. 

I really appreciate you for that. The concern about nature is needed but it's just that I find the self-proclaimed altruistic love for nature and acceptance of meat eating and animal slavery as hypocritic. Since you condemn both these things, I  don't have much qualms.

Regarding ""people like you"", I feel that I might have come across as an unaware guy. It's not that, I don't even eat meat, if that matters to you. I just see things the way they are. I see that literally everything I am using, including this phone, comes at a heavy environmental cost. I see that the only reason humans (including me) are concerned about global warming because it's in our self interest. I really don't see any trend of altruistic concern about environment **in cases where human interest and environmental interests conflict**. In such a case, I really find it hypocritical to support such causes of supporting animals in case of a human animal conflict.",2018-10-09 23:02:16

On Saturday, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said: ‚ÄúThirty-six will come from there (France), the rest will be made here.‚Äù No specific number was mentioned.

&gt; On July 19 this year, Dassault chief executive officer Eric Trappier told a media conference after announcing its first-half results: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve chosen the site in Nagpur. We are allied with Reliance. We‚Äôve set up a joint venture‚Ä¶.

Specially if it means proper citizen giving away its privacy. 

Every rich countries (compare to its neighbouring countries) have illegal immigrant problem. Every country try to blame them for all of their problem instead of finding the real fault specially if the real fault points towards them. Then they try to solve the ""illegal immigrants problem"" and ending up damaging more. Trump, Brexit are example of this. Modi is also example of this. BJP was the result of Congress is the problem instead of system itself was the problem. Demonization effected more people then illegal immigrants. Banks shooting themselve in foots (NPAs) by giving loans to people like Vijay Mallya our are big problems and not illegal immigrants.

If they have better life in India then their country then I am happy to share my resources. Before anyone says we have our own poor to take care of. I asked them who are taking more from the poor, illegal immigrants or corrupt bureaucracy? Solving corruption will solve almost all of our problems and taking drastic measures to solve illegal immigrants not gonna do anything. Learn from brexit and trump. 

Corruption has no solution except transperany. When someone take any measure to reduce corruption ask your self a question, does it make system more transparent or not. If people would have asked this question during demonization they would have know it was going to be a failure. Every one was from families to friends behave like iy is going to end corruption and my only question was how. I could only see punishing corrupt people but how it is going to end corruption I could not see. If punishing people with harsher punishment would have result in lower crime China would have no corruption.

138,"&gt; The company is the same. It changed hands in 2014-2015. It's quite easy to see why Dassault chose Reliance ADAG as a partner. Familiarity with the specific business unit they were going to work with.

Familiarity with which business unit, if I may ask?

***

Here is the circular from Competition Commission of India dated 20-Apr-2015: **https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/C-2015-04-261_0.pdf**

&gt; The proposed combination relates to **acquisition of at least 25.1 percent equity shares of Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Company Limited (""Pipavav"") by Reliance Defence**, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited (""Reliance Infra‚Äù).


&gt; **Pipavav is a listed, public limited company** incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and is currently engaged in the **business of defence shipbuilding, commercial shipbuilding, offshore construction and refurbishment**. Further, it also intends to enter into businesses such as, heavy engineering, defence compact systems, manufacturing of tanks and aerospace. It has **five subsidiaries and one joint venture company, out of which only one subsidiary**, namely, E Complex Private Limited, which is **engaged in the business of development of special economic zones, has commenced commercial operations**. 


&gt; Based on the information provided by the Parties, there is no horizontal overlap between the products/services of the Parties. While Pipavav is active in the defence sector, manufacturing of commercial ships and repair of oil rigs; Reliance Infra is an active player in the infrastructure sector and **Reliance Defence is yet to commence its commercial operations**. Further, none of the group companies of Reliance Infra are active in the sectors wherein Pipavav is active.

HERE ARE SOME FACTS ABOUT THE GANGA WARRIOR
GD Agarwal was born to a farming family in Uttar Pradesh in 1932.
He went on to obtain a degree in civil engineering from the University of Roorkee, now known as IIT Roorkee.
He later obtained a PhD in environmental engineering from the University of California at Berkeley.
He was the first member secretary of the Central Pollution Control Board during 1979-80, a time when he was also a visiting faculty member at IIT Roorkee.
He was formerly also the head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at IIT Kanpur.
Agarwal was a vocal critic of the hydroelectric projects planned on the river Bhagirathi, for which he went on fast on multiple occasions.
He first went on fast in 2009, protesting against the Loharinag Pala Hydro Power Project, coming close to death on the 36th day -- forcing the government to suspend the dam construction, which finally resulted in him ending his fast.
In 2011, he renounced material pursuits and became a sanyasi. He took on the name Swami Gyanswaroop Sanand.
Dissatisfied with the ineffectiveness of the National Ganges River Basin Authority, an authority set up by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh for cleaning the Ganga, Agarwal once again sat on an indefinite fast in 2013.
Bowing to Agarwal's two-and-a-half month long fast, the government finally decided to convene a meeting of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) after a gap of 18 months.
In February 2018, Agrawal sent an open letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to stop environmentally unfriendly projects and to keep the flow of the Ganga uninterrupted.
He demanded a stop on all projects on the Alaknanda and Mandakini rivers. On June 22, 2018, he sat on another indefinite fast.
On October 9, he stopped drinking water and refused to take medicine, water or any fluid or juice orally.
He died on the 111th day of his fast at AIIMS Rishikesh.

215,"Generally explanations are a bit lengthy. I am hoping you read these 4-5 paragraphs, ;)       


The RBIs primary concern is access to data. This was evident to them when investigating financial frauds, more recently on Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi. Without access to financial data, the agencies were restricted in presenting a case to UK to extradite their own runaway citizen. This was also evident during 26/11 terror attacks. The payment trail was difficult to establish because data on financial transactions were out of bounds to Indian authorities. They had to follow lengthy procedures to gain access.      

&amp;#x200B;

So there argument is more pressing in their perspective, generally termed, ""In interest of National Security"". It is valid. And if you think about it, any serious financial fraud of monstrous nature can have rippling effects down to the last citizen. You will see it as low interests on your investments, high costs to products and services because banks cant lend anymore, lower subsidies on critical items, slow down of national projects, etc.       


Now this does not particularly concern you, a simple citizen. On a day to day basis, you are more likely be concerned with intrusive advertisements, or data breaches or profiling.       

&amp;#x200B;

Here to gain a simple understanding, one looks at the recent Cambridge Analytica (CA) incident. Data of roughly 9 crore Facebook users was used for the Trump campaign by a political consulting firm. But only roughly 3 Lakh users had played the game created by CA. Because those 3 Lakh users were not aware how much or for what their data will be used for. Data Protection laws looks to address these by clearly asking services to reveal such information. I found an [interesting page](https://privacyinternational.org/state-privacy/1002/state-privacy-india#dataprotection) which gives the state of privacy in India.        


Now of course, your concern is that government in power would anycase abuse them. So this squarely falls on simple citizens like you to present a case for stricter data privacy norms. GDPR is a shining example. No data of EU residents leave the EU. EU citizens have absolute control on what their data be used for and the ability to withdraw consent anytime.       


Remember, companies like Google or Facebook or even PayTM, Jio, which are staunchly in favour, are no saint. You have to ensure companies respect the data you intentionally hand over and they utilize them only for those services you are faithfully made aware of.",2018-10-14 15:05:57

Why blame me or anyone else for the hateful ideology that the RSS / BJP has adopted? In this particular case, shouldn't the government be taking steps to reassure the migrants that the government does care about their safety? Instead it announces that it will enact legislation to ensure industries provide 80% of jobs to Gujaratis thus further fueling the xenophobia targeted at the migrants. 

And the BJP CM of Uttar Pradesh, where some of the migrant workers are from, seems to be more worried about Gujarat than the people of his own states and even tries to downplay the incident.

&gt; Your party's soft terror supporting ideology

That's funny. Blame all your party's hard faults on the ""soft"" ideology of the Congress?

The city of Allahabad is being renamed to Prayag by Yogi Adityanath- Cheif Minister of Uttar Pradesh- the most populated state in India. Yogi is one of the most radical leaders of BJP. He's infamous for all the divisive politics, and this just adds to the plethora of such notorious acts.

Akbar has been not just the biggest Muslim king of Indian history but possibly one of the biggest king India has ever seen, rivalled only by the great Ashoka. Mughals are considered the big villain of India and Hindus by the right wingers.

They're editing history, berating Muslim emperors as monsters or mere looters. They're even editing history books, declaring Mughals the losers of significant battles which Mughals actually won. This is where **Destroying the Mughal legacy** allegation come from. Renaming Allahabad is another addition to the narrative.

- Congress does believe in a free media and as a necessary pillar of democracy. As part of politics, certain congress ministers did use their friendship with journalists or media owners to influence the news. The BJP / RSS and Modi however operate on a different level - they openly harass and threaten the journalists with mental and physical threats, and the media owners with investigations and tax threats.

- Despite what the media says, the Congress has never been very chummy with the corporates. While give and take has been there, the Congress always ensures that they dictate what to concede to a corporate sector when in power (because they will never forget that India was once enslaved by a business). Modi *kaka* is however openly corrupt, and if he thinks you are his buddy, and are willing to pay the right amount, he will outright give you what you want. This also helps him, as most visual media is owned by corporates.

- With his crony capitalism, Modi *kaka* and his party have become really very rich. So they are the clients for many of these media outlets too, as due to their inexperience, they heavily rely on the media. This also gives them a lot of influence with them.",2018-10-17 18:57:50

301,"None of the answers here are straightforward to the Indian context.

Right Wing in India now refers to Hindutva-driven ideological segments. RSS-BJP supporters fall in this category. 

Left refers to the people the right hate most, which is a sweeping combination of Communist/Marxist types as well as Indian National Congress voters.

Right has become anyone who supports Modi (blindly or otherwise). Left encompasses most of those who oppose him - assumed by many to be de facto Congress voters. It has little to do with economics these days and more to do with the way we've drawn dividing lines around ourselves as a nation. If you dislike Modi, you are automatically assumed to be a RaGa voter. I'm not saying it makes sense, but this is the way that it is for most people.

Economically, there isn't much difference between the majority of right wing and the left. Only the communists/marxists (a minority) represent a significantly dissenting economic outlook. Traditionally, these people occupy what is known as ""Left"" but now they have been swept into the same room as Congress supporters and various secular folk of different ideologies.

Usually, right and left refers to economic schools of thought but I find that doesn't apply too much in India. The average Congress voter who misses the Manmohan era would probably have little to disagree with the average Modi supporter when it comes to macroeconomics. We have the same combination of huge welfare spending coupled with huge corporate-romancing and FDI-seeking economics. Huge state control combined with a huge private sector. It defies simple ""left/right"" descriptions.

The rich simply don't care. Another liter of consumption a day for them ? Doesn't matters.  An additional 100 rs a day for a upper class person is chillar , compared to a poor man who goes around the city on his moped selling his wares and services.


And before someone complains that Government is encouraging electric and hybrid, Let me remind them that we have a 40% duty on lithium batteries, 18% on electronics and 12% for raw rare earth metals, none of which can be mined in India. And building up manufacturing infrastructure takes more than 5 years thumping of 'Make in India'. It is a decade long process which requires massive tax breaks and special provisions like STP for software industries. And let's not forget the rampant protectionism that has ruined the local industry by not forcing them to be competitive against Chinese and even American/European industries.

As for the thing about the debt, I don't see why we (as in taxpayers) should be concerned about it. If the JV between Reliance and Dassault fails, the only ones that lose money are those two companies. Dassault has a time limit for fulfilling its offset obligation and if it fails to do so in time, it'll be fined for it. The JV is not manufacturing any parts for Rafale, it only does so for a commercial jet that we don't purchase. Finally, the financial backing for the JV is provided by Dassault through a EUR 100 million investment, while Reliance is supplying the land and infrastructure.",2018-10-20 09:38:14
340,"

&gt;It also ignores multiple independent reports starting from April 2013 till February 2015, which stated that there were disagreements between Indian MoD and Dassault over a key RFP requirement of providing quality guarantee on HAL-built Rafales. This is not even considering the price, which had escalated due to HAL requiring 2.7 times the man hours quoted by Dassault in its bid to assemble the fighters and the presence of unpriced miscellaneous items in Dassault's bid


Eric Trappier was quoted as saying that the deal for Rafale with HAL was 95% complete just 10 days before Modi went to France and scrapped the original deal.


&gt;when they simply cannot be compared. The acquisition of Sukhoi Su-30 fighters was structured differently when compared to the Rafale acquisition as it constituted two separate agreements, one with Sukhoi and Irkutsk signed in 1996 for 40 aircraft with transfer of technology (ToT) for license production of subsequent aircraft and a separate contract with HAL signed in 2000 for 140 aircraft. Just taking the initial agreement and claiming that since it includes ToT the deal for 36 Rafales should too is severely misleading as there is no plan for follow-up license production in India.


Sukhoi was offered to India even before it was inducted into the Russian Air force . You are convininetly spinning the narrative. The agreement was that Transfer of Technology would occur as soon as Russia mastered their own technology themselves. As soon as Russia mastered Sukhoi manufacturing transfer of technology occured.


&gt;The remaining three private shipyards‚ÄîABG, Bharti and Alcock Ashdown‚Äîare in severe financial distress, worse than Pipavav before its acquisition by Reliance. ABG could not even continue construction on an Indian Navy contract for three small training ships, Bharti's situation is so bad that it is insolvent right now and Alcock Ashdown also could not fulfil a much smaller Indian Navy contract for 6 survey catamarans.

If everyone is in financial distress why not give it to a Government Shipyard . After all the Government has no business giving it to private shipyards and providing them business when they are incurring losses.


&gt;It ignores one of the main aims of the Strategic Partnership model, that is to create competition for defence PSUs by supporting private companies through guaranteed orders. Choosing HAL or Hindustan Shipyard as a strategic partner would completely defeat the point of the policy

So HAL or Hindustan Shipyard which makes profits shouldn't be given any projects, only loss making private companies should be given projects so that they deliver  the equipment the armed forces needs very late or sometimes not at all.



&gt;The 2.7 man hour multiplier that HAL required for assembly of Rafales is because of a complete lack of automation and a dependency on manual assembly.

You are now selectively quoting news reports when you accused Caravan of the same. 2.7 man hour multiplier is a claim from the Dassault side .
You are now making ridiculous claims that it is for the lack of automation and not for the time required for the transfer of technology to take place.

&gt;This pushes up the cost of every aircraft produced by HAL, including Tejas, which has to be borne by the taxpayer.
Tejas is an indegeniously developed aircraft as such it's cost will be high. HAL makes profits , it's not a subsidised PSU .




&gt;Sure, the government's plan to get private players to build capital warships has mostly failed, but that is mostly due to a lack of interested companies with deep pockets. 

And in airspace Anil Ambani's group with 45k crore in debts has deep pockets ?

341,"&gt;Eric Trappier was quoted as saying that the deal for Rafale with HAL was 95% complete just 10 days before Modi went to France and scrapped the original deal.

Re-read the first sentence in my reply. It is not in his or his company's interest to admit to any problems. Obviously he'll say that everything is hunky-dory.

&gt;Sukhoi was offered to India even before it was inducted into the Russian Air force . You are convininetly spinning the narrative. The agreement was that Transfer of Technology would occur as soon as Russia mastered their own technology themselves. As soon as Russia mastered Sukhoi manufacturing transfer of technology occured.

Su-30 is a modification of Su-27UB, which had been in Russian service for some time. Anyway, I don't see how anything that you said contradicts what I said.

&gt;If everyone is in financial distress why not give it to a Government Shipyard . After all the Government has no business giving it to private shipyards and providing them business when they are incurring losses.

The answer is simple, a lack of competition among public shipyards. The public shipyards are ""nominated"" for contracts and they have no reason to improve as they have guaranteed orders with zero competition. Private shipyards cannot compete on their own in the beginning as the public shipyards have built up their capacity and infrastructure from older orders. If private shipyards can be given an initial boost with guaranteed orders, they'll create competition, improving both public _and_ private shipyards.

&gt;So HAL or Hindustan Shipyard which makes profits shouldn't be given any projects, only loss making private companies should be given projects so that they deliver the equipment the armed forces needs very late or sometimes not at all.

Its not a binary. There are enough orders for HAL with Tejas (an ongoing production of 40, another ongoing procurement of 83, plus an intent for 108 aircraft) and over 400+ helicopters. Hindustan Shipyard too has multiple orders. The point is to split some guaranteed orders among a larger group so that they'll be forced to compete for others and try for exports. The profits of HAL and Hindustan Shipyard means nothing, they usually get cost-plus contracts with guaranteed profits while private prayers have to complete in lowest bidder procurement. If they managed to make a loss even with guaranteed profits then that'd be an achievement.

&gt;2.7 man hour multiplier is a claim from the Dassault side . You are now making ridiculous claims that it is for the lack of automation and not for the time required for the transfer of technology to take place.

There are conflicting reports on who made the assessment, but the fact is that HAL did not disagree with it. Even former HAL chairman [T. Suvarna Raju admitted that](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hal-could-have-built-rafale-jets-in-india-says-former-boss/story-Cr0dMhZXToq1GBIdXY97YI.html).

&gt;He admitted that HAL may not have been able to build the planes at the desired ‚Äúcost-per-piece‚Äù, one of the reasons why that deal fell through, but insisted that the company has the ability to make advanced fighters.

The claim about a lack of automation is also not mine, it is [HAL's explanation for the higher man hours](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-deal-on-track-pm-modi-to-take-final-call-742124).

&gt;HAL has countered that Indian labour isn't as productive as in France and also, the level of automation here is less.

A delegation from US visiting HAL [also had the same observation](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10NEWDELHI347_a.html).

&gt;The assembly work was being done almost entirely by hand, with no evidence of any automated production processes.

342,"First up. The biggest message of this article was that Modi on a whim decided to change a deal without even talking to members of his government and bureaucracy. People who had negotiated over years were basically ignored just because he felt like it. These are pretty clear from the statements made by his foreign secreatry and his defense minister. And also by his general tendency to take such arbitrary decisions. A single person should never have this kind of power.  Even if it leads to some crazy awesome deal. Which this clearly is not.

Now coming to your specific points. According to your first argument, HAL would have increased cost due to increased manpower requirements. They're is no clear sourcing for this. But I will take you at gave value. Dassault should have factored this whole making their initial bid. Why didn't they? Could they have had HAL invest in technology to reduce manpower required? And even assuming this cost increase was unforeseen and could not be overcome under any circumstances, the other fighter which passed technical recommendations, the typhoon would have become cheaper according to your own source. They could have finalized that instead. Eurofighter was negotiating with the government while the government was dealing with Dassult anyway. So why this overnight decision to change the deal?

The paragraphs leading up to the statement you quote about the price in dassaults financial statements was showing that cost per plane increased. And that no one was clear what the exact cost the current deal was. And this true. The government went to great lengths to say that this confidential and we can't reverse the price due to BS diplomatic reasons.

Regarding the Sukhoi acquisition, u/Zicoisgreat has a great point in that the places were offered to us even before they were offered to Russia and the technology transfer was done once they mastered it. Additionally this argument was made in the contract that the original deal the UPA negotiated included technology transfer. This primary question as to why this was foregone is never answered. 

And finally the argument that strategic partnership program was started to create competition to PSUs. I fundamentally disagree with this concept. The best company, irrespective of public or private, should get the contract. But keeping my philosophy aside and indulging in this argument, i want to add that the article talks about this as well. Of how conditions were laid so that manufacturers who were actually in the business and could have grown were could never compete and these debt ridden large corporations (some of which have no expertise ) can suddenly come in and get potential windfalls. Also you say that giving these guaranteed orders will hopefully attract companies with deep pockets. But by the looks of it, it has attracted companies that are over leveraged and deep in debt(mostly to public sector Banks and thus the government). Sensible companies mostly seem to avoid it. So the whole premise is a failure. If you really want to give guaranteed contracts and attract good companies you need to also not have an emperor figure at the top who seems to make whimsical decisions and perhaps favors his friends.

Sigh. Do you really expect officials to publicly talk about a potential deal before even bringing it up with the other side? Instead of a selective reading of others statements, lets see what they actually said. [IAF said that it was consulted before the deal was announced.](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2018/10/03/iaf-was-consulted-before-buying-rafale-jets.html) Parrikar said that Modi took the decision and he backed it.  Nitin Gokhale states in following in his book (for which Parrikar wrote the foreword)

&gt;Under the circumstances, there was no alternative but to withdraw the original tender, Parrikar told Modi, since the CVC (Central Vigilance Commission) guidelines provide that negotiations cannot be held with the competitor who has come second in the contract (L2 vendor in officialese). The defence minister suggested that the only way left was to scrap the tender and buy a minimum number of Rafale jets off the shelf to fill a critical gap in the IAF‚Äôs inventory. The Prime Minister agreed and decided to talk to the French President about such a possibility during his upcoming visit to Paris in April 2015.

You also ignored that there were irreconcilable differences between Indian MoD and Dassault over RFP requirements. There were issues with price, with no clarity on who the lowest bidder was.

&gt;The best company, irrespective of public or private, should get the contract.

Sure, for that to happen, there has to be a level playing field. If the sector is so hard to break into that incumbents have a monopoly, it is not unfair to give new competitors a leg up.

&gt;Of how conditions were laid so that manufacturers who were actually in the business and could have grown were could never compete and these debt ridden large corporations (some of which have no expertise ) can suddenly come in and get potential windfalls.

Nothing in the article makes that claim. L&amp;T is in a good financial position. Pipavav was the only private shipyard that could compete with L&amp;T, but they were in a lot of debt. Anybody who acquired them would have entered the game. It just so happened that Reliance did so.

&gt;But by the looks of it, it has attracted companies that are over leveraged and deep in debt(mostly to public sector Banks and thus the government). Sensible companies mostly seem to avoid it.

Quite a few companies have thrown their hat in. L&amp;T is participating as SP for ships, Tata wants to be an SP for aircraft and land systems with their Lockheed Martin and Bharat Forge tie-ups respectively, Mahindra wants to be an SP for aircraft and helicopters with their Boeing and Airbus tie-ups respectively. Basically, every major conglomerate that had even a small participation in defence sector wants to scale up.

356,"&gt;But I don't expect them to outright lie to me either.

It was not an outright lie. The procurement for 36 was a parallel process that superseded the RFP for 126 only after it was confirmed. It was not incorrect to say that HAL, Dassault and MoD were discussing the purchase, because they still were until March 2015 when MoD asked Dassault to give its final answer on RFP compliance and price of HAL-built jets. The scrapping of MMRCA was confirmed only after a replacement was found. In case the deal for 36 could not be arrived at, MMRCA would have had to be salvaged a different way.

&gt;After being blindsided they are of course going to approve later to save face.

So you accept that they could not talk about the deal before it was announced, but anything they said after it was announced is irrelevant?

&gt;My point was if there were finding it so hard to negotiate a good deal with Dassult, and it was unclear who the lowest bidder was why didn't they do serious negotiations with the other bidder as well? 

CVC guidelines prevent negotiations with L2. If a new L-2 was to be declared, it would have opened MoD to legal challenges by Dassault and the negotiations with Eurofighter would have had to start from scratch, which would have delayed the purchase by years.

&gt;I was referring to the portions where he interviews the Naidu person. 

Such organic growth takes decades. He also rails about ""no cost no commitment"", expecting MoD to pay for demonstration of products, which would open MoD up to more claims of corruption. He also basically wants guaranteed procurement without any precondition of lowest price or a performance guarantee, which will simply never happen.

&gt;But it still doesn't explain why Dassult chose one of the last impressive options as their primary partner.

They said this to [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-deal-anil-ambanis-firm-was-registered-had-land-near-airport-dassault-defence-1921482):

&gt;Dassault, one of the world's most established and experienced defence manufacturers, picked Anil Ambani's debt-ridden firm as a partner in India, ""because it was registered with the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and had land in Nagpur which provided access to the runway,"" said top sources at the French firm, speaking to NDTV on the condition of anonymity.

357,"&gt;The wages are quite irrelevant. Dassault and HAL calculated the overall costs and both agree that it would have been costlier to build at HAL. HAL chairman admits that HAL would not have been able to build Rafales at the price that was bid by Dassault. Anything else is just conjecture, unless you can show that one of these two are wrong.

HAL chairman never admitted what you are claiming . They admitted there might have been a case of differences in the amount of manhours required . If Dassault was unable to fulfill the bid, a new bidding round should have been initiated rather than Modi scrapping the original deal and introducing a new one especially given that Eutofighter was available at a 20 % discount . 
It would have made Dassault the L2 bidder .

&gt;Yes, I am saying that. Private companies don't get cost-plus contracts as they always have to bid in lowest bidder procurement. 

No they don't. If the Technical aspects of the bid are better than the other bids they can be awarded contracts . Do read the Defence Procurement Code before spouting your inane bullshit .


&gt;That is an outright lie. No private company can raise prices after a contract is signed, especially unilaterally.

Once again read the procurement code. There is price elasticity due to inflation and cost of raw material  introduced in it .


&gt;If a majority of its profits are made from interest on advances, the argument that efficiency of HAL is demonstrated by its profits falls flat.

Sardar Vallabhai Patel, union home minister, to Guru Golwalkar, RSS chief in a letter written on September 11, 1948. 

The letter is quoted in full in Desraj Goel‚Äôs Rahstriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

The entire Text:

Aurangzeb Road, 
New Delhi,11th Sept. 1948

Brother Sri Golwalkar,

Received your letter dated 11th August. Jawaharlal has also sent me your letter of the same date.

You are very well aware of my views on the RSS. I have expressed these thoughts at Jaipur in December last month at Lucknow in January. The people had welcomed those views. I had hoped that your people also would accept them. But they appear to have no effect on the RSS persons, nor was there any change in their programmes. There can be no doubt that the RSS did service to the Hindu Society. In the areas where there was the need for help and organisation, the young men of the RSS protected women and children and strove much for their sake. No person of understanding could have a word of objection regarding that. But the objectionable part arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmans. Organising Hindus and helping them is one thing but going in for revenge for its sufferings on innocent and helpless men, women and children is quite another thing.

Apart from this, their opposition to the Congress, that too of such virulence, disregarding all considerations of personality, decency or decorum, created a kind of unrest among the people. All their speeches were full communal poison. It was not necessary to spread poison and enthuse the Hindus and organise for their protection. As a final result of the poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the valuable life of Gandhiji. Even an iota of sympathy of the Government or of the people no more remained for the RSS. In fact the opposition grew. Opposition turned more severe, when the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji‚Äôs death. Under these conditions it became inevitable for the Government to take action against the RSS.

Since then, over six months have elapsed. We have hoped that after this lapse of time,  with full and proper consideration the RSS persons would come to the right path. But from the reports that come to me, it is evident that attempts to put fresh life into their same old activities are afoot. I once again ask you to give your thought to my Jaipur and Lucknow speeches and accept the path I had indicated for the RSS. I am quite certain that therein lies the good of the RSS and the country and moving in that path we can join hands in achieving the welfare of our country. Of course, you are aware that we are passing through delicate times. It is the duty of every one from the highest to the lowliest in this country to contribute his mite, in whatever way possible, to the service of the country. In this delicate hour there is no place for party conflicts and old quarrels. I thoroughly convinced that the RSS men can carry on their patriotic endeavor only by joining the Congress and not by keeping separate or by opposing. I am glad that you have been released. I hope that you will arrive at the proper decision after due consideration of what I have said above. With regard to restrictions imposed upon you I am in correspondence with the CP Government. I shall let you know after receiving their reply.

Yours

SD. VALLABH BHAI PATEL

The UPA's first term had better growth because global factors were favorable. There was plenty to go around. When the recession hit, Manmohan Singh didn't do shit except hoard the remaining money and resources under the expert ""guidance"" of Sonia Gandhi. 

Right now, under Modi, the economy is growing well, despite the global rise in oil prices causing the rupee to fall against the currencies of oil exporters. Why? Because India imports oil. The fuel prices are up for the same reason. India needs to produce oil. That's the only problem. 

Healthcare up to 5 lakhs is given to every family. More subsidies for poor families. He is cracking down on corruption. More bank accounts. More pensions. Stalled infrastructure projects have resumed. Higher education institutions have been given autonomy. GST ensures fewer taxes, a more clear-cut process which means no bribes and time waste. Aadhar linkage to every transaction for transparency and security. The national budget is finally being put to good use. India has climbed much higher on the ease of doing business rankings. 

Oh, and again, finally, someone is cracking down on corruption. 

I am no fan of the nationalist and hindu propoganda and I wish that Modi could remain in office without bringing the RSS with him, but he can't. He is taking all the right steps. The crony capitalism happens against his wishes. It's a slow process to root out such deep seated corruption. He has spoken out repeatedly against it and admonished his ministers. 

Again one man cannot keep all the rogue elements in line. But as far as development and welfare is concerned, he is taking all the right steps. 

As for congress, not only do they have a complete idiot for their key representative, but in any of their counters, they never talk about their own plans for development. Only petty schoolyard taunting. To add to that, the UPA's terrible track record after the recession hit speaks for itself in terms of the economy, welfare, corruption, even communal tensions ( A guy was driven out the country for a painting and the government did nothing. Honor killings and unjust social crimes were pretty rampant.) The country wasn't even business friendly despite the great need for more money during the recession. 

You name one challenge that the UPA govt successfully navigated, forget what they did better than the current administration.

PC - Bhadrak 

MP - Arjun Sethi

Party BJD

He is generally controversy free. He Has been MP since 1998. He was Cabinet minister in NDA1. The constituency has good number of minority voters . In 2014 Modi wave year he garnered 465 of the vote. In 2015 it does not look like his tally is going to drop. There were few communal flash points in last couple of years that might consolidate the BJP votes. But i dont foresee BJP overtaking INC for second place. The BJP organisation is pretty weak in this district. So my opinion status quo will remain unless he decides to retire.

Oil prices peaked at 141 dollars per barrel  during the UPA regime . It's not even crossed a 100 now yet we have the highest ever petrol prices.  India hoarded the money ? I would like to know where you pull such wild claims out of your ass. If You want to compare by the method of calculation of the new GDP, Manmomhan Singh left Modi a government at an economy growing at 6.9 % and Modi has got it to 7.3 over four years . Hardly a great achievement .

&gt; Healthcare up to 5 lakhs is given to every family. More subsidies for poor families. He is cracking down on corruption. More bank accounts. More pensions. Stalled infrastructure projects have resumed. Higher education institutions have been given autonomy. GST ensures fewer taxes, a more clear-cut process which means no bribes and time waste. Aadhar linkage to every transaction for transparency and security. The national budget is finally being put to good use. India has climbed much higher on the ease of doing business rankings.

Against an estimated budget of more than 1 lakh crore only 2000 crore has been allotted for the Insurance scheme . Try getting your proposals elsewhere . Stalled infrastructure projects due to demonetization might have resumed . Not sure why you are patting Modi's back for partially healing a self inflicted wound ?
There is a huge shortfall in GST collection which is making the Government bleed every PSU dry in order to meet fiscal deficit targets.  India has climbed higher on the ease of business ranking but has ranked lower in the inquality and  hunger ranking, it has slipped lower in the world press freedom rankings. It has been marked lower in human rights rankings .


&gt; Oh, and again, finally, someone is cracking down on corruption. 

Mind telling me where it is , Is it in the Rafalle deal or the Gujarat Petroleum One in which Modi Forced OnGC to takeover to hide his corruption ? Why hasn't he cracked down on chikki scams or the Vyapam scam where every witness seems to be dying ? 

&gt; I am no fan of the nationalist and hindu propoganda and I wish that Modi could remain in office without bringing the RSS with him, but he can't. He is taking all the right steps. The crony capitalism happens against his wishes. It's a slow process to root out such deep seated corruption. He has spoken out repeatedly against it and admonished his ministers. 

&gt;Again one man cannot keep all the rogue elements in line. But as far as development and welfare is concerned, he is taking all the right steps. 

Ya not like he goes campaigning on Ambani and Adani jets . Out of the 33 countries he had visited until the end of 2017. In 16 countries either Vedanta, Adnais or Ambanis have signed deals immediately after his visit . 

What right steps has he been taking ? Education allocation as a % age of the budget has come down from 3.15% in the UPA rule to 2.72% currently . In the name of welfare of the 23 schemes Modi has launched he just renamed 19 of them from the UPA time.

&gt;As for congress, not only do they have a complete idiot for their key representative, but in any of their counters, they never talk about their own plans for development. Only petty schoolyard taunting. To add to that, the UPA's terrible track record after the recession hit speaks for itself in terms of the economy, welfare, corruption, even communal tensions ( A guy was driven out the country for a painting and the government did nothing. Honor killings and unjust social crimes were pretty rampant.) The country wasn't even business friendly despite the great need for more money during the recession. 

UPA 's terrible record after the recession hit ? After the recession hit , India was  the second largest growing economy after China and that was without the modified GDP growth rates.  

Here guys leave the country after committing billions of dollars worth of fraud now . Here people like Najeeb disappear because they study in JNU and the police look on. The country isn't business friendly now it's just crony capitalism friendly .


&gt;You name one challenge that the UPA govt successfully navigated, forget what they did better than the current administration. 

When Satyam's chairman S Raju commited fraud he was sent to jail , Similar with Sahara and Subrata Roy . This happened during UPA time . 
Contrast that to BJP's time were the likes of Mallya, Modi , Chowksi and plenty others left the country after defrauding the country of billions of dollars.  This is what happened during the BJP's time. 

There are plenty of other examples but I am sure you won't listen to any of them.

Exactly. Modi's vibrant Gujarat and Modi's economic 'decisions' too benefited because of a Globalized world.

He fought the 2014 election with the promise of repeating Gujarat-model across India while the truth was most of Gujarat's progress during Modi's Chief-Minister-ship was neither exceptional from Gujarat P.o.V nor solely/exclusively because of Modi's economic acumen.

&amp;#x200B;

The entire atmosphere from 2000 to 2016 looks unrepeatable now. Those were the acche din.

If a person like him (prof of Constitutional law, student activist, influenced by Left and socialist movements) we'd have more government welfare programs and tougher regulations on businesses and higher corporate taxes. 

On foreign policy, a lot of more focus would be on diplomatic channels and robust multinational alliances against a common threat. There would also be a lot more of push on a peaceful settlement with Pakistan. 

On our nationalised banks, there would be a more balanced and grounded approach to corporate loans and an effort to reduce NPAs.

But interestingly, in order to get his chair, a stiff rivalry between the two officers who are considered close to the power centre in the Modi regime has begun. First person is Yogesh Chandra Modi who is an IPS officer of Assam and Meghalaya cadre and at present he is the Director General of the National Investigation Agency-NIA. The other officer is Rakesh Asthana, who is currently on the number two office bearer in the CBI. He is also considers himself as the natural contender for the post.

&gt; In the bureaucratic circles in Delhi, Yogesh Modi is considered as BJP's President Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi's confidant.

[CBI top post: Power struggle has begun between Yogesh Modi, Rakesh Asthana](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/cbi-top-post-power-struggle-has-begun-between-yogesh-modi-rakesh-asthana)

&gt; Sources say this kind of tussle is not limited to the CBI but can be seen in all of bureaucracy. And the reason is the deployment of officers and officials associated with Gujarat and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for every important post in every important ministry.

&gt; ... Those who closely monitor the bureaucracy believe that for the first time in the PMO, the officers from one state are dominating the department.

&gt; ... A senior journalist from Ahmedabad said, on condition of anonymity, *""In order to create a new coalition of politicians and bureaucrats in Gujarat and for politicisation of the state's bureaucracy, Modi set up a new political culture in the state ‚Äî regardless of the image of the officer and even he has a bad track record, if the officer is in good books of Amit Shah, then he or she is given a clean chit.""*

447,"For someone like you who prides themselves on not buying into propoganda, it seems like it would be simple enough to research the economics of the depreciating rupee and the high oil prices. 

The price of fuel is higher now because it started at a higher base value. The crude oil price may not be the highest it's ever been, but since the US sanctioned Iran, it is high enough to cause a sharp depreciation of the rupee from the exchange baseline, and a sharp rise of fuel prices from their baseline. 

Also you have neglected to factor inflation. The US wasn't doing well in 2008. The world wasn't doing well in 2008. That is why India was able to maintain its economic standing and stable prices. Today, the US has fracking and its allies have to obey its sanctions which results in a very different economic context. Not to mention the Modi govt brought down inflation from double digits to under 6 percent. They have also increased interest rates to keep the money in India and not let it move abroad, which means fewer loans in the short-term and therefore, slightly reduced economic growth for now. 

The point here is that Modi Govt is in fact taking all the right steps. It is not their fault if the global economic context makes things harder than during the UPA government. It's easy enough for you to access this info, yet you choose to cherry pick ""peak"" oil price numbers without context to cast doubt on the highly competent and sensible economic decisions that the Modi government has made.

Tie ups with Ambanis to reduce the price of data and communications. GST reducing taxes. More tax payers than ever before due to his efforts against corruption. 

Yes his mistakes have been expensive. I'm with you there. But the alternative scares me. Congress candidates will end up being the Gandhi family's executioners. Just like Manmohan Singh, who was such a successful financial minister, but was run into the ground by the Gandhi family. Inflation down from double digits to under 6 percent. 

The economic growth has slowed because the international powers have gotten stronger, and the import prices have increased unlike in 2008 when the US's economy was down. It will stabilize once we work out a deal with Iran that doesn't piss off the US and once Brexit comes through the rupee will appreciate again. In any event, local oil produce is the next step but that is another discussion. 

Right now the only realistic choice is between Congress and BJP, and given all of the steps Modi has taken, I choose Modi over another mouthpiece for the corrupt Gandhi family. ",2018-10-23 21:06:18

Lol The Centre raised taxes by 175 % from 2014 on Petroleum products and reduced it by 27 % after petrol was in danger of crossing 100. They still are earning 13 rupees more per litre of petrol than the UPA earned on 16 May 2014 via taxes.
 
Us imposed sanctions on Iran from 2012 to 2015 . That didn't cause a huge depreciation in the Rupee then . It was pinned down to corruption and UPA 's lethargy in policy making . Now it is due to US imposing sanctions on Iran and nothing at all to do with Modi. Pull the other one .

Fracking as an industry died due to low fuel prices and is just starting to pickup again. Fracking is so expensive that it doesn't make sense to continue unless crude oil touches 90 dollars a barrel.
UPA did the same thing high interest rates to control inflation and succeeded but then you were crying out about how ease of business was effected .

I don't know where you spout your facts from. The Recession of 2008 was the worst since 1929's great depression . The world took more than 5 years to come out of the recession. Compared to that tumultuous situation then  the current economic situation is merely a hiccup

When confronted with facts you choose to lie. 
Answer me these questions  since you are so full of facts and what not -:

1. Are you claiming that the Recession was comparable to the current economic climate around the world ?
2. Has the Government increased the excise duty in Petroleum since 2014 and has refused to roll them back while collecting an extra 10 lakh crore in the proces?
3. You have claimed that Modi Government values education then why has the education budget as a %age of the total budget been reduced ? Also do explain why teachers and professors  aren't allowed to speak out against the Government's policies or face having their employment terminated ?
Ask yourself these questions first and then spout about the respective performances about the BJP and the UPA?

Article published yesterday:

&gt; The importance of India in South Korea‚Äôs foreign policy has risen in recent years. South Korean President Moon Jae-in‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Southern Policy‚Äù (NSP) attached primacy to strengthening the country‚Äôs economic and strategic relations with India, as well as the countries of Southeast Asia. It is the first time that South Korea has clearly designed a foreign policy initiative for India and officially documented it.

&gt; There are two primary reasons for the shift in South Korea‚Äôs outlook to India. One is that Seoul sees India and the ASEAN countries as new economic partners: by strengthening ties with these countries, South Korea intends to reduce its over-dependence on its traditional trade allies that are China and, partially, the United States. The other reason is that South Korea is making a subtle move to endorse the ‚ÄòIndo-Pacific‚Äô geopolitical construct by aligning with India and the ASEAN countries without officially saying so. Central to this shift, however, is the mitigation of its China-related risks.

&gt; South Korea‚Äôs choice for India is best explained in the words of Trade Minister Kim hyun-chong who said, ‚ÄúIndia is a country that has no sensitive issues with us geopolitically, so has little risk of its economic cooperation wavering due to external factors. China, for example, created serious problems for our country over the THAAD issue, but with India there are no such variables.‚Äù

&gt; The South Korean companies in India, such as Samsung, LG Electronics and Hyundai Motor, are undertaking expansion activities. For instance, Kia Motors has signed an MoU to invest about US$ 1.1 billion, which was later enhanced to US$ 2 billion, to build its first factory in Andhra Pradesh. The Lotte Group, which was the main target of the Chinese retaliation strategy last year,[16] has discussed a proposal to invest US$ 3-5 billion in the next five years. Seoul is also pushing its small and middle-scale companies to enter India in view of tough challenges they are facing in China.

&gt; In a signal to China‚Äôs growing unilateral action in the maritime sphere, both leaders are supporting initiatives for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region through dialogue, underlining the centrality of sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law.

&gt; South Korea has demonstrated its desire to cooperate with India to secure the sea lines of communication (SLOCs) in the Indian Ocean. The navies of the two countries have held a joint drill in the Indian Ocean with a fleet of South Korean warships visiting Mumbai in October 2017. This was followed by a joint exercise between the coast guards of the two countries in April 2018 in Chennai.

tl;dr: Business and politics. Korea is concerned with China's emergence and assertion. They want another economic and defence partner to offset that threat. Korean businesses are aiming to expand in India and would perhaps get favourable treatment. In exchange Modi gets good PR for 2019. Overall good for India but the award is a joke.

491,"Gujaratis overwhelmingly voted for Modi and his henchmen/women in numerous elections. Tells you a lot about the Gujarati mindset.

And the 2002 riots tell a whole lot more too.

I don't get why Indians get so triggered about generalizations about their own community. Kinda funny actually. Gujaratis and Tamil Brahmins are some really fragile special snowflakes in this regard.",2018-10-24 16:52:42

Again without any sources backing up your allegations. Looks like I found the classic Trump/Modi supporter.
