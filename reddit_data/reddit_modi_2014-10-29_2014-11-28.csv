0,"&gt; Point is, Kejriwal would have been ridiculed either way

This. People don't realise this point and still support him blindly instead of supporting the cause for which AAP stands.

They don't have a central leadership mandating all decisions - this is both a good and bad thing. Bad because obviously it can lead to anarchy. Good because there will be no conflict of interest. Accountability will be so focused on the candidate in question that he cannot dream of doing anything illegal.

Kejriwal would have made a horrible PM what with having to deal with infractions from 2 neighbouring countries with a strong hand. So I'm happy Modi got elected but sad that people do not understand what a grass roots movement is. If they understood and voted the other way, it'd be sensible. But most people - like the entire adult populace of my family - have only one opinion: yaaro yevano. Nambalkku therinjavanukku vote podalaam.

13,"i seriously dont get the point of this ""feature"".

there is SO MUCH to be done for the railways. forget high speed trains, we need normal speed trains. most trains in india are languishing at &lt;50kmph. so many seats run empty because trains are running at odd times and odd days. most compartments dont even have a consistent quality in their berths. trains are often late except for the destination and even if they keep time it is because of insane buffer or at the expense of other ""lesser"" trains.

there needs to be a sincere effort in improving the railways. tokenism such as this wont help anyone. instead of this wifi, if they had spent on a platform ticket vending machine, it would have been a lot more helpful.

similarly, before spending crap loads on bullet trains, it would be great if all trains can run at an average speed of 70-100kmph. note average and not top speed.

when modi said that he will start a railway revolution, i really expected a lot. but so far NOTHING of importance has even been announced. i dont consider bullet trains of being good to the country. they will only take away money from other real problems that the railways need solving (such as 70kmph trains, track doubling, civilized toilets, punctuality without buffer etc)",2014-10-29 12:34:26

&gt;&gt; The rioting and arson, the first big incident of communal nature since a long time, took place under the nose of the “world’s largest metropolitan police”, which reports to the Central government led by Narendra Modi. The latter had called for a 10-year moratorium on caste and communal violence during his Independence Day speech.
That was a good call (it was admittedly a good speech too).
Tension mounted once again on Friday night after former BJP MLA Sunil Kumar Vaidya allegedly visited the area and was reportedly greeted by furious chants of ‘Har Har Mahadev’. Locals alleged that he instigated people for a fresh round of violence immediately after one dies down

I believe the general consensus was that BJP flamed the Hindus, SP flamed the Muslims. At least that's what I have read in various reports.
Terror modules in WB? ""I fear riots""- Mamta
I don't see that anywhere, the reports I have read have lampooned Mamta for her inept and dangerous handling of the situation.
However, all this aside, you haven't addressed the crux of my argument. PM Modi promised us a government free of riots. Yet, his party members have been on a rampage issuing communally charged statements.
I already believe that each party in India uses religion to garner votes. What is the BJP doing to change my perception? Going by the recent events, nothing. Not even token noise from the PM who was never shy of speaking.

53,"There's a lot of (mis)information on the legal aspect of this case.

#1 **Black Money List** Let me first refresh how we obtained this *golden list*. A French national employee of the HSBC Geneva bank account acted like a whistle blower to reveal money laundering accounts to the French government. The French government found some Indian accounts and forwarded it to the Indian government. 

#2 **DTAA agreement** [Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_taxation) (DTAA) in simple terms is an agreement that allows an individual residing outside India to avoid dual tax. In other words, if you are a NRI - you are free not to pay tax in India as long as you do so in your host country. The agreement basically refers to share financial (and other) details of an individual between two countries IFF there is a prosecution in one of the two countries.

#3 **DTAA as a hindrance to reveal names** Common sense dictates that DTAA was not an issue because the list does not violate DTAA between France and India. Jaitley was just raising jargon in the media regarding this. The Supreme Court clarified this in absolute detail in 2011.

#4 **DTAA review order** The government submitted a review petition regarding the Supreme Court's DTAA order.  Now, when the SC asked to reveal the list to it the government - the government cites the DTAA agreement (which does not apply in this case). Basically, the Modi government was just parroting the UPA government line of defense that DTAA was preventing it and argued in court for about 30 minutes! In the end, the SC judge bench got irritated with this defense and told the central government that they won't review the earlier order just because there is a change in government.

#5 **List was already with SIT** The list was submitted to the SC for formal record keeping. The government is the defendant in this case - note the entire black money case is a PIL. The government has to formally submit names of all people it tried and the ones it did not. The list has to be submitted by the government not SIT to keep their record on statement. Also, SC can release the entire list at an appropriate time without reliance on the government. In addition, as stated above there as no legal reason not to share the list. Also, SIT is just one investigation agency - the SC yesterday told that they can submit the same list to other investigation agencies including Enforcement Directorate (which is an appropriate agency considering its domain knowledge on foreign money etc.) or CBI or any other investigation agency it deems fit. SIT is formed by the government and it wants to avoid a case where the list is not shared between two agencies due to further bureaucratic hurdles.


#6 **DTAA with Swtizerland** For now, the DTAA agreement with Switzerland is only for account holders after April 1, 2011. This was intentionally done by the UPA government to protect certain names. This is still up for review in court thanks to the people who filed the PIL.

Tl;DR - The UPA government delayed as much as possible but this government was dangerously treading the same line and the SC was DONE dealing with the BS. Hence, the scathing remarks.

Then your argument is weak - because the link clearly says he said X to a TV new channel which by default means aired. 

&gt; You are saying there is no possibility that a news channel recorded an interview and decided not to air it because Kejriwal calling everyone and their grandma someone's agent is as common as the sun rising in the morning.

So you are saying that a news paper wrote an interview about something which was not aired and then said that they told it in an interview to a news channel?

The picture where Modi comes into play is after he got hold a letter from GPSC (Gujarat PSU) to the Central Government on a steep gas price hike. It was a transitional period in India's political space and Kejriwal was merely questioning the silence of the next Prime Minister of India on the gas price hike in context of the letter.

The ""Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister of Corporate Affairs from the UPA"" is not a minion to file an FIR against. It is the ministry who takes a decision and hence the FIR. Meanwhile, the Modi government has clipped the wings of the Delhi ACB (which was the primary investigation agency). May I ask why?

&gt; In the same context he should have been questioning the MD of the GPSC and not Modi.

You are mentioning two very contradictory points. The MD of gas price hike is not Sonia but you want him to question Sonia. OTOH, you want the MD of GPSC to be questioned.

&gt; Also keep in mind the GPSC is a profit oriented organisation and is independent. It will do what it should to maximise profits. How exactly is this suddenly Modi's stance?

The Gujarat government has 95% equity in GPSC. More than 2/3rds of the BoG in GPSC are either serving or served members of the Gujarat government. The CAG indicted the Gujarat government to give undue favors to GSPC. Kejriwal merely raised a question based on these three facts. Just like you are raising questions on Kejriwal - it is fair game to raise important questions like gas price hike.

&gt; For the n'th time, why did he not ask Sonia why the prices were raised, why ministers were fired etc etc?

In that case, you have not watched news channels. AAP has lambasted the Congress on the firing of the ministers on TV news debate. Every time this gas price hike came in - they said talked about Jairam Ramesh and Anand Sharma. 

You want them to target Sonia Gandhi. Why? Sonia Gandhi is not the government just like Amit Shah is not the government. AAP talks about the government. In other cases, you say don't shoot off before having any proof. In case of gas price hike, the appropriate person is the Head of the Oil Ministry. They clearly have stated that Congress are hand in-glove with the Ambanis. AAP has also repeatedly cited the Radia tapes - *Congress toh humor dukaan hai.* 

TL;DR - You can not use AAP's shoulder to shoot on Sonia Gandhi. Your likes, dislikes aside. This calling out specific names will never end - Why does Modi not call out Ambani? Why does Modi not call out X or Y?

If AK questions Moily = He should question the MD of GPSC
If AK questions Sonia = He should question Modi (which is still asinine considering he wasn't even in power and had nothing to do with the hike).

Why did AK question Moily and leave Sonia, but question Modi and not the MD?

&gt;The Gujarat government has 95% equity in GPSC. More than 2/3rds of the BoG in GPSC are either serving or served members of the Gujarat government. The CAG indicted the Gujarat government to give undue favors to GSPC. Kejriwal merely raised a question based on these three facts. Just like you are raising questions on Kejriwal - it is fair game to raise important questions like gas price hike.

It still does not take away from my point. It is an org that seeks to maximise profits (that is the Modi model of reviving moribund PSU's). It is not Gujarat state policy.

&gt;In that case, you have not watched news channels. AAP has lambasted the Congress on the firing of the ministers on TV news debate. Every time this gas price hike came in - they said talked about Jairam Ramesh and Anand Sharma.

Again, Jairam, Anand Sharma, Congress but no Sonia...why? If AK had questioned, attacked the BJP and not Modi, it makes sense. Why did AK campaign against Modi in Varanasi and not Amethi against Sonia?

* He went on ""inspection tours"" to Gujarat but not Amethi. 

* The real head of the UPA for 10 years was SOnia, the real target should have been Sonia. Why did he after the initial Vadra rush (in 2012) ignore Sonia altogether? 

* Why 200 or whatever number of Tweets targetting Modi and zero on Sonia.

If you are opposing one thing in opposition and practicing same in power, it shows nothing but how much you care of national interest. In either case, (in opposition, or in power) you are not giving importance to national interest. (for sake of power, may be). So, this matters to me. I like people who are man of their words. Not someone, who can't be trusted for his words, for what he is saying, because you know, he may be a totally different person tomorrow.

162,"I am copying a comment I made yesterday from a legal point of view. There's a lot of (mis)information on the legal aspect of this case.

#1 **Black Money List** Let me first refresh how we obtained this *golden list*. A French national employee of the HSBC Geneva bank account acted like a whistle blower to reveal money laundering accounts to the French government. The French government found some Indian accounts and forwarded it to the Indian government. 

#2 **DTAA agreement** [Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_taxation) (DTAA) in simple terms is an agreement that allows an individual residing outside India to avoid dual tax. In other words, if you are a NRI - you are free not to pay tax in India as long as you do so in your host country. The agreement basically refers to share financial (and other) details of an individual between two countries IFF there is a prosecution in one of the two countries.

#3 **DTAA as a hindrance to reveal names** Common sense dictates that DTAA was not an issue because the list does not violate DTAA between France and India. Jaitley was just raising jargon in the media regarding this. The Supreme Court clarified this in absolute detail in 2011.

#4 **DTAA review order** The government submitted a review petition regarding the Supreme Court's DTAA order.  Now, when the SC asked to reveal the list to it the government - the government cites the DTAA agreement (which does not apply in this case). Basically, the Modi government was just parroting the UPA government line of defense that DTAA was preventing it and argued in court for about 30 minutes! In the end, the SC judge bench got irritated with this defense and told the central government that they won't review the earlier order just because there is a change in government.

#5 **List was already with SIT** The list was submitted to the SC for formal record keeping. The government is the defendant in this case - note the entire black money case is a PIL. The government has to formally submit names of all people it tried and the ones it did not. The list has to be submitted by the government not SIT to keep their record on statement. Also, SC can release the entire list at an appropriate time without reliance on the government. In addition, as stated above there as no legal reason not to share the list. Also, SIT is just one investigation agency - the SC yesterday told that they can submit the same list to other investigation agencies including Enforcement Directorate (which is an appropriate agency considering its domain knowledge on foreign money etc.) or CBI or any other investigation agency it deems fit. SIT is formed by the government and it wants to avoid a case where the list is not shared between two agencies due to further bureaucratic hurdles.


#6 **DTAA with Swtizerland** For now, the DTAA agreement with Switzerland is only for account holders after April 1, 2011. This was intentionally done by the UPA government to protect certain names. This is still up for review in court thanks to the people who filed the PIL.

Tl;DR - The UPA government delayed as much as possible but this government was dangerously treading the same line and the SC was DONE dealing with the BS. Hence, the scathing remarks.

Why can't Modi interact with media outside the setting of Air India One? Modi has dictatorial tendencies. That is a given. So let's criticize that rather than asking for free jamborees for the press. Most of them anyways are corporate assholes. 

There is caviar. It came out in public domain in Sanjaya Baru's book. 

Yes they have been. The same dumbfucks like Barkha used to enjoy international vacations at tax payers expense.

&gt; There have been different sides and even the officials were free to speak (unlike they are now).

How does ferrying them abroad help change this? This is an issue with Modi's perception of democracy and his authoritarian streak where he sees himself as some sort of messiah. What should startle you most is that most of the media has decided to crawl rather than show some spine and stand up to him. The bonhomie at his Diwali Milap should have given you the hint as to where the winds are blowing. 

&gt;Let us not count pennies. Look at the bigger picture.

What bigger picture? The media has plenty of opportunities to embarrass him. They should have shown some self respect and boycotted the Diwali milap. The fuckers were there taking selfies and eating right of his pam. If this is the way they behave, I'm glad he leaves them behind. At least save some money. And I thought this would enrage them to examine his links with corporates critically. Rather they can't eulogize him enough.

Now that you do mention the US govt, while I get your point, the Obama administration is under severe criticism for their selective briefings, overtly favoring journalists and refusing to answer questions. Not great signs for a democracy.

If there are no tax-waivers the investors are less likely to invest. I am not sure, if the tax waivers are removed govt would still be able to collect that much amount in taxes.

Yes, reduction in farmers force is not only a problem but also a threat to the nation because we are losing our ability to grow our own grains and it's a pity they can make more money by working as maids.

The issue is not TVM. The issue is crony capitalism. You sign a contract with the govt. to deliver the gas the govt owns at $2.2. Reliance got the contract because they bid lowest. And then since you basically own both national parties you get price revision upwards. If this was going to happen we'd have far more efficient companies pumping gas from KG basin.

254,"Assuming that dividing the country implies the start of a separatist or an extremist movement and a violent counter-reaction to that, Mr Modi is factually wrong. Sikh Militancy and the Khalistan movement were a reality much before 1984. Countless Sikhs and Hindus had already suffered from the hands of Khalistanis in late 70s and early 80s. In-fact, Bhindranwale's was at his peak in 1984. 

Loss of every innocent life is condemn-able in strongest terms, and what happened in '84 Delhi was nothing less than a genocide. But here, the attempt by NaMo is not to reach out to the people affected by those horrendous events. Instead it is to deflect attention from a  significant historical movement forever etched in BJP's (and Sangh's) legacy, i.e Babri Masjid demolition and the ensuing communal disturbances. The events in '92 divided country country like no other event before. One can read ""Dongri To Dubai"" (or watch 'Black Friday', ~~another movie harassed by the censor board~~) to know how the events in Ayodha finally culminated in the Mumbai bomb blasts. 

Whenever the state becomes complicit in the murder of innocents, it triggers a chain of event which results in deranged individuals taking vengeance by attacking the innocent civilians.

258,"About Kamal Nath, I agree he should be not be given posts even he was proven ""not-guilty"" . I won't argue that because he role was dubious. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_Nath


&gt;Kamal Nath was indicted by the Nanavati Commission on allegations that he was involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Only one witness, Mukhtiar Singh, testified to seeing Nath lead an armed mob that attacked and demolished a Gurudwara in Rakab Ganj.[25] However, there was no evidence that he incited the crowd. In fact, one of the key witnesses, Indian Express Photographer Monish Sanjay Suri, stated that Kamal Nath tried to disperse the crowd, and there was no evidence that he encouraged violence during the riot.[26] Several Sikhs were burned alive during the attack.[27] Nath responded to the Commission, saying that he visited the Gurudwara later in the day to investigate the agitation and urge peace.

&gt;The Commission Report observed that Nath's testimony was ""vague"" and ""not consistent with the evidence"" and that his version of events was ""A little of strange."" However it disregarded the contradictions in his testimony, saying ""It is also required to be considered that he was called upon to give an explanation after about 20 years and probably for that reason he was not able to give more details."" In conclusion the Commission said, ""In absence of better evidence it is not possible for the Commission to say that he had in any manner instigated the mob or that he was involved in the attack on the Gurudwara"".[28] Justice Nanavati further stated that ""it would not be proper to come to the conclusion that Kamal Nath had in any manner instigated the mob.[26]""

&gt;Canadian Sikhs protested his visit to Toronto 23 March 2010.[29]

&gt;On 6 April 2010 Sikhs for Justice[30] a US-based human rights advocacy group along with two individuals Jasbir Singh and Mohinder Singh filed a lawsuit against Kamal Nath in the Southern District of New York for leading the mob that killed Sikhs and attacked Gurdawara Rakab Ganj in Delhi on 1 November 1984. The lawsuit was filed under Alien Torts Claim Act and Torture Victims Protection Act. US District Court issued summons to Kamal Nath asking him to respond to the complaint. Kamal Nath received summons and complaint the same day in the evening while he was in Manhattan, New York.[31]

&gt;The court complaint was dismissed in March 2012 by Judge Robert Sweet of the US District Court Southern District of New York, against Nath, who stated that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[32] The 22-page order granted Nath's motion to dismiss the claim, and the judge also noted that 'Sikhs for Justice' failed to ""serve the summons and its complaints to Nath in an appropriate and desired manner.

2. The invitation to Nawaz Sharif and to not invite Modi comes under his official prerogative if we look at it on a surface level. 
3. However, one has to look at the reasoning he is giving for inviting one and not the other. He has stated that he and Nawaz Sharif have relations. These ""relations"" I think would deem an invitation at a personal capacity. 
4. Invitations at a personal capacity are done in BAD TASTE as the head of a Masjid, he should invite people on their official capacity, i.e. The Prime Minister of Pakistan (whomsoever he may be, and whatsoever he may have done.) 
5. The invitation to Modi is also done at a personal capacity as HE feels along with his committee that MODI (not the PMO) has not done enough to Muslims. If that is the case, why invite Rajnath Singh who endorses Modi and is part of his govt. ? 
6. This shows that the Imam has made big mistakes: a. He as indulged in using his official position as an Imam to make personal Invitations. b. The Jamia Masjid should not be treated as his family property as he is rightly accused of being treating it as such. c. Notably, he is indulging in politics by doing this claim of Modi's muslim popularity. As a head of a religious centre, he should not be involved in the political stances of people and should be focused on religious discourse. 
7. I conclude by saying that it is the Imam's official post that should make these invitations, not some personal feeling of like and dislike to certain individuals. Since it is the latter, I feel that he really does not reserve the right to invite Nawaz Sharif. 

Lastly of note, Arvind Kejriwal is a person without morals. He states something and does a complete U-turn with the seat sharing with the congress. If he is really outraged by these events, why doesn't he do a bloody dharna in front of the masjid ? ",2014-10-31 23:50:19

293,"&gt;My point was that if you're looking for party with internal democracy and openess then a Modi led BJP is not your choice.

Actually, there is one big difference between this and Congress. Modi's position is not permanent. He will only keep heading the BJP so long as he delivers. Also Shah. They may be autocratic, but they have earned their position and power and others in the party have the chance to take their place if they also deliver and/or if Modi/Shah slip up.

We won't ever see that kind of democracy in the Congress or in many of the smaller parties. Rahul and Sonia will always rule the Congress whether they win or lose, Mulayam and his family will always control the SP etc.

I'll agree with that. Most of his supporters are not blind and there are parts of him that they may be uncomfortable with. Modi's ruthlessness against his rivals, even it means sidelining good leaders in the party, is one such thing I rather dislike.

But it is not as if the leaders of most parties in India don't behave in a similar way, and like I have said above unlike, say, Sonia or Mulayam, Modi's position is temporary and defined by his performance, so if he does not deliver, then like Advani he will no longer be able to impose his control over the party workers and leadership.

 He will be facing hardened politicians like Pawars, Congress biggies who managed to hold on their constituencies despite modi's efforts.

They have run organisations,co-operative sectors,  political outfits and what not.

If you say he understands rural dynamics and effectively display his political acumen in a state like maha than i would certainly find it hilarious.

They also focused on what the two governments could do to keep dialogue going despite the recent cancellation of foreign secretary-level talks.The meeting took place with the knowledge of the Indian government .

The MEA (ministry of external affairs) was kept informed and we will soon give a report to them (about the dialogue output),"" Gen Ashok K Mehta, the convener of Dubai dialogue, told this newspaper.A file photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Pak counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Delhi.While the government is not associated with the Dubai group, its approval for the same to go ahead in difficult circumstances is significant as it came at a time when neither country seemed sure about how to move ahead.India cancelled the scheduled August dialogue because of Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit's meetings with Hurriyat leaders and the Narendra Modi government is not expected to make any concession at least until the J&amp;K elections.At the same time, Pakistan has announced that any proposal for resumption for dialogue, in whatever form, has to come from New Delhi as it was India which torpedoed the fledgling dialogue resumption process. Many are looking at the upcoming Saarc summit in Kathmandu as an opportunity to start afresh with a bilateral meeting, or at least a short pull aside, between Modi and Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif but so far neither country has even dropped a hint about any such proposal.The Dubai track-II group was formed in 2003 taking into account the Parliament attack and the subsequent Indian army build-up? which sparked fear of a full-scale war. According to Mehta, ?the format was tweaked a bit this time to focus mainly on ways to deal with likely consequences of another Mumbai-type adventurism by any Pakistan-based state or non-state actor. The Modi government, as India's response at LoC/ IB made manifest, would certainly like to be seen as responding to such an attack with a lot more spunk than what was witnessed under the previous government. Mehta though said the change in format had nothing to do with a more assertive government in place here.The Dubai dialogue also had representatives from Kashmir from both sides. Apart from Mehta, ambassador Jayanta Prasad also participated in the dialogue. The Pakistani delegation was headed by Humayun Khan?, former ambassador to Afghanistan. The group has met every year since 2003, including days after the Mumbai attacks, to look at ways to improve relations.

Besides, legacies are incredibly complex (and might I add ""dynamic""). Eg: The relationship between Indira Gandhi and the Sikhs.

NEW DELHI: Giving an idea of the nature of next year's Budget, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said it should be ""full of new ideas"" with transformational and measurable deliverables. 



 In an interaction with secretaries of various ministries and departments, he said the budget should be ""output to outcome-oriented"", inferring that investments should have measurable outcomes, sources told PTI. 



 During the interaction over 'high tea' at his residence, the Prime Minister reviewed the progress of work being done on various government initiatives, including the 'Swachh Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns, and asked the bureaucrats to take decisions without any fear while assuring his full backing. 



 While talking about the next Budget, he said it should have transformational and measurable deliverables. ""It should be full of new ideas,"" he said, in a hint of how the proposals should be.

&gt; he toning down of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of 2006 to exempt many categories of buildings and construction projects from seeking environmental clearances.


&gt; According to Pushp Jain, director of EIA Resource and Response Centre, an environment assessment think-tank, the government, instead of addressing the existing loopholes in the notification, went on to diluting whatever little was there in it.


[2](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-08-28/news/53324639_1_environment-ministry-prakash-javadekar-irrigation-projects)

&gt; Under Javadekar, the ministry has also allowed a bunch of industries — like coal tar processing units, etc — to get clearances from generally lax state governments. It has exempted irrigation projects affecting less than 2,000 hectares from environmental clearances and announced that those below 10,000 hectares can be cleared by the state governments.


&gt; it reconstituted the National Board of Wildlife's standing committee such that it no longer has any independent wildlife or ecology experts. And, about a month ago, it changed norms used for defining forests as violate or inviolate — diluting them so as to allow mining over a greater chunk of the country's forests.


[3](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/nda-eases-green-rules-to-push-investments-114080700031_1.html)

&gt; The need for consent from gram sabhas for prospecting in forests has also been done away with. This dilutes the Forest Rights Act, which requires the consent of tribals before forest land is diverted to industrial activity. Alongside, inspection of mining projects by ministry officials for plots less than 100 hectares has been removed. The ministry has also set aside the requirement of compensatory afforestation for prospectors.


[4](http://www.ibtimes.com/india-approves-projects-dash-growth-alarming-green-groups-1702680)

&gt; In late August, India's environment ministry rejected a proposal to build ... the country's largest hydropower plant in ... northeast because of the potential damage to an area rich in biodiversity.


&gt; Less than a month later and, according to two environment ministry officials, after pressure from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, permission was granted for the 3,000 megawatt Dibang plant, the construction of which will mean clearing some 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) of forest.


&gt; The plant is one of hundreds of projects, many of which were repeatedly rejected in the past, that have been approved since Modi came to power in May.


[5](http://qz.com/255772/the-11-environmental-disasters-narendra-modi-blessed-in-his-first-100-days/)


&gt; National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) reconstituted by slashing the number of independent members from 15 to just three. 


&gt; dilution of the local consent requirement for public-private-partnership projects, removal of the social impact assessment requirement, delinking compensation for land from market value, relaxing the time limit for completing acquisition, not returning unutilised lands to the original owners, giving states overriding discretionary powers, etc.

leader with an air of nonchalance.

Devendra called thrice, Arun Jaitley and Amit Shah once eachShiv Sena was down in the dumps for over a week with political analysts lambasting it for lack of political wisdom. But the saffron party's (read Sena) last ploy to join the BJP-led government seems to have hit the bullseye.With the Bharatiya Janata Party's not responding to the Sena's lowest offer of swearing in at least two of its MLAs as ministers on Friday, the Sena leadership conveyed to the BJP late on Thursday night that the party was not boycotting the grand function. Of course, it threw in a rider. The Sena said that if the BJP refused to budge, it would not hesitate to announce its leader of the opposition immediately after Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as chief minister.With the BJP realizing that the Sena had made up its mind to sit in the opposition in the Assembly, forcing the BJP to bargain with independents and take the NCP's unconditional support, the BJP leadership blinked and decided to reach out to the Sena. Five phone calls were made to Matoshree within a span of five hours on Friday afternoon. The CM-designate, Devendra Fadnavis, himself called up Uddhav thrice, asking him to attend the swearing-in. In an emotional pitch, he even told Uddhav to attend the oath-taking as it was Balasaheb's dream to see their government.Uddhav, incidentally, had even finalized the name of Ravindra Waikar's for the post of leader of the opposition.The Sena had announced on Thursday night that due to repeated humiliation by the BJP, it would not attend the swearing-in. With Uddhav not budging, BJP president Amit Shah called on him followed by a call from Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. Shah repeatedly told Uddhav that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, wanted Uddhav at Wankhede, adding that the Sena would be given a share in the government and every single issue would be sorted out. Shah even promised to give the Sena a positive deal.With the Sena's ploy working and the BJP back at the talks table, the Sena leadership, which has been under pressure from a section within to join the government, took a step back.Uddhav and his wife Rashmi reached Wankhede just in time for the swearing-in. Soon after the function was over, Uddhav met Shah for a brief period.""Things are going fine so far. We will tell you the rest later,"" Uddhav said after the meeting.According to Sena insiders, the party has clearly told the BJP that its share in the government should be based on a 2:1 ratio.It also wanted the BJP to make a public statement, saying the Sena would be part of the government. ""We want a reasonable deal of at least one-third share in the government. We have asked the BJP to agree to it publicly. We will wait till November 10 while carrying on talks with them. If they do not agree to our terms, we will vote against them in the House on November 10. They will be forced to take the NCP's support which we think they can ill afford now,"" said a senior leader, who was part of the Sena's last minute strategy session.BJPUddhavSenaBJPUddhavji'sBJPBJPSena

They don't need a certificate from Modi. They shouldn't even bank on a certificate from Modi. They shouldn't have the slightest shred of belief in a certificate from Modi.

&gt;**Narendra Modi:** Secondly, I would like to say that your name will go into history books, from your first interview to your last. Times Now has got that credit.

&gt;**Modi on Kodnani:** When I made her a minister she was not charged. She has the right to get justice from any court'

Instead, you're diverting your own attention away from what he's saying to making attacks on his character. Standard definition of an ad hominem argument.

494,"&gt;you should really go through your comments and posts.

Which ones? The ones in support of the Palestinian Arabs? Decrying fellow /r/Indians for needlessly bringing in ISIS in that thread about an auto driver insulting a Muslim? Maybe the ones in which I call out BJP / Modi for the entire red herring and bs filled ""Blackmoney search""? Or his cabinet seleciton? Or the 100's of posts against Irani and her dumbshit ways? Or maybe calling out the ABVP for their moral policing?

Why don't you point me towards a single positive comment about Hindus / BJP / Modi that you have made?

&gt;and that is wrong.It doesnt make anything like this right.

So why didn't you and others (the recent episode happened in Sept 2014 a month ago) make a post and talk about the evils of Islamic fundamentalism?

For the record, I think this is the beauty of Indian Secularism (note the absence of quotes) - We learn to adjust and move on. It becomes an issue when a lot of the ""secularists"" make this non issue an issue.",2014-11-03 13:24:53

i supported them in drive against tobacco.And for majority of time i can see through the fake promises which BJP and congress make as i have lived in their states and i know both are not going to do anything against big shot corruption.I have even stated that i didnt liked the statement of AAPs Shazia on religion.The bias of mine which i accept is that i do not like the concept of religion,which divides people.

497,"It looks like just another ice water bucket challenge whereas it should have resembled a national movement with huge amount of propaganda material and volunteership programmes, like the mission272 program BJP organised.

The good thing about BJP &amp; Modi is they make corrections and quickly if they see the current mode is not working. Hopefully that happens early. ",2014-11-03 13:59:30
498,"Completely agree. 

As a middle class, liberal Indian, I wanted to vote for the AAP. Sadly they turned out to be a bunch of conservative, moral policing, pseudo-secular conspiracy theorists. 

I still wait for the day when I will have the option to vote for a politician who believes in individual liberty, true secularism, and empowering Indians with the right kinds of regulations/de-regulations. I guess I am asking for too much :(

But well, till then - Modi :/",2014-11-03 14:16:27
