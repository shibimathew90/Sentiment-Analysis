&gt;* If there's one thing a section of Bollywood badly wants, it's to censor out the Chairman of the CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification).

&gt;* There is revolt brewing within, and there are allegations bossman Pahlaj Nihalani is a stooge of the current central government.

&gt;* Nihalani doesn't even try to conceal his affection for Modi, in fact, he's just put out a film that has some audiences in cinema halls make a beeline for the snack bar.

&gt;* I have a personal experience of how movies get certified, I have served as a president of the industry body in the past.I am not tough on anything, otherwise all films would have been rejected.

&gt;* We will not allow anyone to use Bombay in any film that's set in the period post 1995.We have to follow policies of a state where the hub of Bollywood is located.You have a wrong perception.That is your feeling, your taste.

&gt; * With the AAP eyeing Punjab in the 2017 assembly polls, campaigning in the state will be discussed along with the activities of the party in other states.

36,"Yeah his entire 30+ year legal career and other professional achievements mean absolutely nothing. (He was an ASG in the 90s (one of the government's top lawyers.) 

And the only reason he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha was because he represented Robert Vadra, and that's why the BJP didn't raise any objections or make any noise about his appointment.

Also nice job, selectively quoting of the Wikipedia article to show a qualified lawyer as  Congress stooge.

38,"That's if you've only started listening to him in the last few years. Once you go through Jafri, Sanjay Bhatt, Haren Pandya's murder after he started talking to the CBI, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's rebuke, Modi's interviews to world media during that time - (""What is your regret? (during the riots)"" M- ""I wish I had managed the news media better""), Maya Kodnani and BJP govt's defense of her from the death penalitypost conviction (which means they either seriously don't giving the slightest shit about muslim genocide or she is blackmailing them with threats to expose other leaders in exchange for protection).

The second part is talking to hardcore Modi supporters - first it's all about 'development, FDI, gujarat, clean chit by HC'. Few weeks in, few pegs down, after talking about aforementioned topics they suddenly open up about how Modi ""taught those muslims a lesson"", ""now they'll know not to mess with Hindus"", and you realize how seriously terrifying it is that they're willing to say that to my face, a person who is clearly not a sympathizer, with no shame or fear of societal repercussion. Even his staunchest don't seem to believe he's fully innocent, they just seem to be impressed that he's managed to get away with it.

As for his actual policies, they are in many ways better than the last govt, and India is in a relatively good place right now because of oil prices. None of this has any mitigating effect on the bigotry of the BJP and many of it's supposedly progressive middle class supporters. ",2015-11-23 13:12:14
39,"Define ""responsible"". Responsible because he failed to control situation? Responsible because he allowed the situation to happen? Responsible because he participated (directly or indirectly) in the situation? This applies to both Modi and Akhilesh, and since you are comparing, you cannot use different definitions.

There are claims on the internet that Modi did express regret (not guilt, because that would imply he considered himself a participant) and that he did not want to remain CM after 2002. He didn't resign because his party convinced him not to. I'm not sure I believe that, but it doesn't matter because he won the following elections. If people elected him and his party, there are two possibilities (i) majority of Gujarat does not hold him responsible for the riots (ii) majority of Gujarat holds him responsible for riots and people want to have a genocidal leader as CM. I can extend the same thing to India and say that (i) majority of India thinks he is a charismatic leader and not responsible for riots, or (ii) majority of India wants to have a communal, genocidal leader as PM.

2002 is an open wound in the history of Gujarat. It is also a permanent blot on Modi. Nobody gives a shit whether he is guilty or innocent as long as they can use him to create political tension.

I am more concerned about the voters of India who elect genocidal, communal, greedy, immoral leaders and then refuse to take responsibility as a society.",2015-11-23 13:17:58

43,"India: A republic of nobodies, most of the nation belongs to them

---

&gt;* Among the nobodies are the inheritors of the unnatural phenomenon of poverty; or people who are deficient in faculties that the modern world rewards; or clinically depressed and too religious to know that; or culturally homeless and incapable of enjoying the world as an orphanage; or suffer from a mental disorder that makes them, as the French journalist Nicolas Hnin, who spent 10 months as a prisoner hostage of the Isis, describes, more stupid than evil.

&gt;* In western Europe, the nobodies are in physical islands of abject failure surrounded in plain sight by a mainstream society that is so happy and thriving, like a Facebook page where everyone else is having a good time.

&gt;* In the past two years, I have passed through this disenchantment in Paris and Brussels that has supplied a handful of the more stupid than evil to a criminal republic that has and may again order the massacre of harmless people going about their generally joyful lives.

&gt;* Their actual art may not change the fates of the nobodies but artists, in the gowns of public intellectuals, use more influential mediums, like journalism, to take on the powerful on behalf of the losers.

&gt;* Salman Rushdie can say, with foreigners naivet, as he did in an interview to Scroll.in, In Bihar, where (Narendra)Modi himself was the face of the election campaign, people proved that they are tolerant, inclusive and pluralistic.

&gt;* When Rahul Gandhi launched an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur today, next to him stood a man who was jailed last year for a hate speech against Mr Modi during the campaign for the national election.As eyebrows were raised at Imran Masood's presence at Mr Gandhi's padhyatra, the Congressman said, ""I am not communal number 1.

&gt;* Mr Gandhi's padh tour of UP that began today is being seen as an early start for the massive battle that the Uttar Pradesh assembly election in early 2017 will be.As he attacked Mr Modi, accusing him of going on foreign tours while neglecting the plight of sugarcane farmers back home in UP, Rahul Gandhi also appealed to the state's chief minister Akhilesh Yadav to help them.

&gt;* ""Akhilesh Yadavji, you claimed to belong to the new generation and promised to change Uttar Pradesh.

&gt;* Go amidst farmers and resolve the sugarcane issue, give money to farmers, start the shut sugar mills and provide jobs to youth,"" he said.After an anti-BJP coalition that included the Congress swept Bihar this month, the strategy is being seen as a possible template in other states to stall the BJP.The win has also galvanised a united Opposition to take on the BJP-led government in a big way in the coming Winter Session of Parliament, which begins this week.

&gt;Kejriwal Denies Reports of AAP Support to Nitish in Bihar Polls

&gt;PTI First Published: September 30, 2015, 11:59 pm

&gt;As Bihar heads for a fierce political battle, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said AAP will not extend support to any political party in the Assembly polls. He hinted that one shouldn’t read too much into his recent visit to Patna to meet Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

&gt;&gt;I am not supporting anyone in Bihar and I have not gone their for campaigning. I had gone (Bihar) for a workshop on governance organised by the Bihar Chief Minister before the dates for elections were announced. – Arvind Kejriwal

&gt;The JD(U) had supported AAP during the Delhi Assembly polls and also during the AAP Chief’s Varanasi fight against Narendra Modi during the Lok Sabha polls. Both Kejriwal and Kumar share a personal rapport.

&gt;The decision comes in the backdrop of Kumar’s ally Lalu Prasad recently making a number of statements to the effect that the Bihar polls is a fight between “forward and backward castes”. A section of AAP was also uncomfortable supporting the grand secular alliance because of Lalu’s conviction in the fodder scam.

&gt; * A railway official, in a file noting last month, wondered why he needed to send the file to NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India Aayog), a government policy think-tank that replaced the 64-year-old Planning Commission early this year.

&gt; * Also, NITI is currently engaged in a mid-term review of the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17), a practice many believed would have been buried alongside the Planning Commission.

&gt; * Early indications suggest that NITI's emphasis will be mostly on health, education, agriculture, governance, physical infrastructure, the north-eastern states, entrepreneurship and innovation and it would consciously attempt to differentiate itself from the Planning Commission's over-emphasis on measurement of poverty.Early this week, former prime minister Manmohan Singh slammed PM Narendra Modi for abolishing the Planning Commission, as he claimed the Plan Panel was a positive and dynamic instrument to steer India's economy despite its shortcomings.

&gt; * For the states, this transition from the Planning Commission to NITI has so far been anything but smooth.

However, I think he is a good marketing man. He's marketing india like no one has ever done before and it seems to be working. But everything else seems just the same as UPA. 



Additionally the Hindu crazies have been given a free rein like never before and they are yanking it for all they've got.

still more credible than politican speeches to judge whether intolerance is rising or not

&gt;But of course, this has nothing to do with intolerance. It all started with Modi becoming the PM.

then there is this:

&gt;The home ministry had last year patted its back for a reduction of more than a fifth in incidents of communal violence over that in 2013 as the number dropped to 644 in 2014 from 823 in the previous year while the deaths fell to 95 from 133. The number of those injured in communal clashes in 2014 also dropped to 1921 from 2,269, the ministry had said earlier.

so 'intolerance' was rising by 18% yoy from 2009 to 2013, then it witnessed a drop in 2014, and then it jumped back up to 2013 level... What does this suggest...",2015-11-24 14:30:45

If Aamir Khan says that there is no increasing intolerance, he will be assumed to be a Modi supporter. If he says there is, he will be assumed to be anti-Modi.

Your point is right. The smart response would have been to respond graciously, thus disproving the point. In fact, some did it. And then some undid that.

Example 1 - attacking response. 

We won't let Aamir leave the country, he is safe. This kind of comment influenced by a politically motivated campaign insults those who have given so much honour to Aamir in India,"" said Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.

Example 2 - Gentler response. Sambit Patra. A much calmer statement. No personal attacks.

""We all love Aamir khan, he has made so many good movies. Incredible India is not intolerant India and he says it himself that 'atithi devo bhava'. We treat our guests as god then we keep our citizen on highest priority. He will never get such a lovely country.""

136,"Lost count of how many times this question has been asked here and how many times it has been clarified. Nevertheless, India is not becoming intolerant anymore than what it was earlier. The only change is that there is a govt. at the center backed by Hindutva Fringe elements. (Yes, terror has many religions. Anyone who says otherwise is only talking diplomatically. And not every liberal is an Islam appeaser). This change is what is creating more friction and eventual protests. I also concede that some of these protests could very well be politically motivated but definitely not all.

Anyways, coming to what most of them(artists, writers, etc.) who are protesting outspokenly (including the recent Aamir Khan) want is very simple. That is for the Govt. (and preferably the PM) to first of all recognize that there are (and have been) problems due to fringe elements and that they unequivocally condemn them. Also promise a speedy justice to the victims (Pansare et al). And most importantly, the protestors are not even saying Govt. or Modi is responsible for this. All they want is a strong statement.

Having said that, I don't think BJP or Modi would ever make such a statement. At the best, you would get delphic statements well after the event. I would not expect anymore from a party which uses ""Pakistan"", ""Cow"", etc. as part of their electoral campaigns.

It's not that they are communal, but they fervently hope (and believe) that Modi will deliver on his nationalist/ economic agenda. However, the hitch in the narrative continues to be the acrid right-wing rhetoric that keeps wafting from within the BJP and allies and diverts attention from the main plot. Understandably, nothing irritates Modi supporters more than these digressions from the script - so conspiracy theories, denial, anger, intolerance..

---

&gt;* In a significant blow to Narendra Modi, the Congress party on Tuesday wrested crucial Ratlam-Jhabua Lok Sabha seat from the BJP, 18 months after the latter had won here by over one lakh vote.

&gt;* Congress Kantilal Bhuria defeated his BJP rival by close to one lakh vote thereby delivering a severe blow to the so-called Modi wave, which critics say had come to an end following Bihar results.

&gt;* Although, Congress suffered defeats in assembly by-polls in Manipur and on one seat in Madhya Pradesh, Ratlams victory has sent shock waves in the BJP camp.

&gt;* Congress said that Ratlams victory had conclusively proven that its splendid showing in Bihar where it won 27 out 40 seats it contested, was no aberration.

&gt;* At 62.29 per cent, the voter turnout was nearly two percentage points less than that in the 2014 general elections, in which the BJP swept 27 out of the 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh.

Also BJP doesn't covertly or overtly support intolerance: every party has motormouths and once in a while they all say something stupid.

&gt;The Twitter accounts of two Delhi-based journalists, Shiv Aroor of the Headlines Today television channel and Kanchan Gupta, formerly of The Pioneer, also feature among those blocked.

He gave it 14 days late after the incident, by which time too many events had passed by. Also I personally found it giving it for the sake of giving a statement (similar to Theek hai?). It was not in the same earnest as that of Obama. This is my personal opinion. Nevertheless, Did I refer to Modi anywhere in my argument. I was very careful to avoid that. Which is why I said the govt's response, where many of the elected representative came added fuel to the fire. Why does everything be reduced to for and against Modi?

But the issue I was trying to make and which, I repeat, Aamir Khan also emphasized is what we expect the very least from elected representatives.

&gt;Also BJP doesn't covertly or overtly support intolerance

To me if you don't rein in communal elements, you are covertly supporting them. This is similar to the argument that if you don't rein in corruption, you are covertly supporting them.

That is problem that is out of my mind why people is not ready to give modi even one term for what he was voted by Indian citizens.  This is disrespect of democracy. This is proxy way to attack a democracy. Only a preoccupied mind needed to do that. Otherwise we have a whole system which directly not in control of modi in many ways. So why are people making a case out of their personal hysteria? Doesn't it show love of congress that these people posses in their heart. How can you call this a democracy if you just cant support any other party than your favourite one.  Favoritism can never lead to any good that is absolute truth.  Why aren't they let people of India judge about him on their own? 
And by doing so aren't they behaving in similar fashion of British imperialism? British also did that; first they outlined the need of their empire by implying that Indian citizen are unable to decide what is 'moral' and what is not? And by going that way, how RSS version is wrong that congress rule was just an integration of British empire?",2015-11-24 22:05:54

&gt; * India is likely to back Bangladesh if the issue of execution of two influential Opposition leaders for war crimes during the country's 1971 independence struggle against Pakistan was taken to any multilateral or international forum.

&gt; * India was supportive of Bangladesh government's decision to bring to justice to those allegedly involved in war crimes and will throw its weight behind Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina if any country takes the matter to any international forum, sources said.

&gt; * On November 22, Bangladesh had executed Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary-General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for war crimes during the 1971 war of independence, which had triggered sporadic violence.

&gt; * Pakistan was severely critical of Bangladesh for executing the two leaders.

187,"There is a virtual intolerance - which is kind of harmless mostly.  In social media the way these matters are being discussed are disturbing.  Online discourse is always that way, anywhere in the world.  But sometimes it feels like,  its only a small step from a virtual tolerance to a physical act of intolerance. Because the police and security in India is not as capable at maintaining law and order.

In 1984, we all know that Congress stoked and actively fueled the situation. Then the mobs took over. And it was impossible to control before thousands of lives were lost.  India / Modi cannot afford another event. 

I fear that there are many smaller offshoots of the RSS who are not disciplined (in the right sense) , are totally decentralized, act locally and who will go out of control. If and when the flood-gates of hatred are opened. These could have names like Mahashiv Sena or XYZ Action Force or whatever obscure names, we have never heard of (because they are purely local).  Yet these smaller , local outfits are taking cues from the bad elements of the BJP and RSS.  These  are borderline street gangs who will act locally, take local revenge, and will be harder to control once the spark is lit.

Managing a communal situation (once it flares up) on a national level is way more harder than controlling a state.  

I recently chatted with a classmate , and she said ""I fear Hinduism is dying"". I thought she's referring to the rapid cultural changes in the country - culture gets confused with religion.  But thats the kind of fear psychosis that is driving Indians into the arms of the RSS and silence will be taken as implicit approval by the outfits that will exploit a communal flareup.

194,"Rough translation:

**Lucknow:** Cabinet minister Azam Khan has written a letter to Aamir Khan in which he agreed with the actor who is controversy over his speech on intolerance, saying that the actor is being unfairly targeted.

**We have a responsibility towards the weak.**

Khan has said in the letter to Aamir that if he(Aamir) and his wife are witnessing this truth(Intolerance), then there is a need to think about the weak, helpless and destitute about whom unbecoming words are being said daily.

**Peoples objections shouldn't weaken the intentions/motivations of an actor.**

He has said in the letter that people have braced for action to defend the harsh words said by Aamir. It is hope that peoples objections do not undermine the intentions/motivations of the actor. Aamir shouldn't feel hopeless due to these circumstances. Even though the screams of pain of a crowd that is being considered as a burden(he is speaking about muslims here) does not reach the tyrannical rulers, but when people like Aamir speak, the echo of their words are heard for a long distance.

**Whatever has been said about intolerance has been said by a Hindu woman.**

While encouraging Aamir, he said that ""The path that does not lead to destination is not a path. And to walk a couple of steps in not called as walking."" Before that, Khan had said, ""Aamir Khan is Muslim, his wife is Hindu. Whatever has been said about Intolerance has been said by a Hindu woman. This is a reality and after getting affected by this reality she said those words being afraid about the future of their kids. Aamir Khan hasn't said those words, so he shouldn't be targeted for that.""

Khan said, ""When in a country of 125 crore even the wife of Aamir Khan is unsafe, she too is a victim of intolerance and is worried about the future of her kids, then think about those who do not have any support, who were targeted in Gujarat riots, 6 December (Babri masjid) and the ones in Muzaffarnagar.""

**MPs, ministers and governors are declaring a part of the population as traitors.**

He said, ""2 days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that terrorism doesn't have any religion, he has said those words but he doesn't mean it. This is a screaming lie, whose consequences we are witnessing today. Muh me raam bagal me churi. The language his entire team is speaking, is spreading intolerance. MPs, ministers and governors are declaring a part of the population as traitors.""

Khan said that Aaamir should associate himself with education too because a lot of question arise because people are illiterate from their minds(paraphrasing), they need education. 

And the rest of the stuff is what Aaamir had said.

I place great importance to how many women parties put in their cabinet because it is a *direct* reflection of their stance on how much responsibility they are willing to accord to women. Changing the attitude of society etc. can be done through policies but that takes time. Political appointments are something that is directly controlled by the ruling party. 

Obviously, none of the political parties in India are gender-equal, but even Congress is better than AAP in this respect. 

I might appear to a tumblr-tier SJW right now (I am not and I hope we don't go that far to the other side as a nation), but I believe that at least 33% of political positions should be occupied by women.

Advani led the mob that pulled it down - only cautioning them so they don't get hurt while doing so. 

The point is the laws against hate speech, fomenting trouble etc only get applied to people who stand up to power.

What has changed is that Modi and his party have seemingly lost their minds. Their focus has to be on economics and development, but they are doing this strange silent treatment every time something indefensible happens.

It is no secret that the liberal intelligentsia hates them. So, the media is going to ask them uncomfortable questions that serve to distract. But remaining silent, instead of vigorously criticising hate crimes, has given the opposition legitimacy that they did not have before.

It has mostly derailed the development agenda and the needed reforms.

There are two possibilities - that Modi is actually a sympathizer of these medieval morons that most of us tried to overlook given the development agenda, or that he is utterly politically tone deaf.

Neither is a pleasant possibility.

The continued presence of incompetent lightweights like Smriti Irani in the Cabinet doesn't help. She was a humorous side show earlier. She is now beginning to be seen as the first sign of poor judgment of Modi, who appointed her.

The narrative has begun to change, and many of us who had serious hopes from this first ever government to put the overdue emphasis on effective governance, are getting disenchanted. Business friendliness and possibility of government downsizing was the big reason many of us even considered the BJP. We would have stayed home otherwise, and let the different goondas fight out the elections otherwise.

&gt; * Punjab has scripted a success story on the solar energy front with projects being undertaken for generating solar power to the tune of 1,550 MW with an investment of Rs 12,000 crore.

&gt; * Announcing this on Tuesday, Punjab New and Renewable Energy Minister Bikram Singh Majithia said, In 2012, we had 9 MW of solar projects involving an investment of Rs 70 crore.

&gt; * In just three years, we have allotted 1,550 MW of solar power projects with an investment of Rs 12,000 crore, creating employment avenues for 10,000 youths. No other State in the country can achieve such a level of growth in such a short time, he added.

&gt; * The Minister said the most interesting part of the solar power policy of Punjab was that farmers having land holdings of four acres and multinational companies, including Adanis, Wellspun, Essel and Azure, were equal partners in the solar revolution being ushered in by the tiny State having just two per cent of the geographical area of the country.

But it is very clear to see what the right-wing fringe (or center, as per your POV) are playing. And that game is simple.. reminiscent of the song ""Accha Sila Diya Tune Mere Pyaar Ka... ""

which is basically pandering to the Hindus... ""See, for so many decades even after treating the Muslims in such a cordial manner (well, atleast not as bad as Hindus are treated in Pakistan)..this is what you get...they still don't trust you. They still feel that you are untrustworthy."" 

And I don't know about you, but at least for me - that is one of the biggest insults. ""to be called untrustworthy"" cause it makes an human being feel...""man, even after all I did for you or even after, you have seen how i am, or how I lead my life... you still don't trust me? Am I so worthless, so as to incapable of winning your trust"". 

Usually, that evokes a lot of anger.  And anger manifests itself in a lot of ways! Mix in a bit of economic jealousy, and that gives a very bloody cocktail - as India has seen again and again at least once every decade since Independence.

275,"I think a portion of India has always been intolerant. What has risen in the last few years or so is acceptance for intolerant ideologies. I don't think people have changed their opinions or actions, but those following fundamentalist or communal ideologies feel much safer now to continue their practices, as they can easily mask their actions as 'nationalism'. Criticism of the country is seen as treachery, and any opinion is quickly assumed to have political undertones. 

For e.g. if anyone makes the statement 'I think some Indians are intolerant', two interpretations are put on it. Those agreeing say 'Yes, Modi is ruining this country', those disagreeing say 'You are a Congress-chamcha destabilizing and defaming the country'.  The core issue gets ignored in both cases. 

Basically, if intolerance exists, I think our task should be to combat it, instead of arguing over whether it is the present government or the previous one that has encouraged more of it. 

Even if one case happens in a country of millions, that case should be condemned and not ignored, and definitely not lauded. It does not matter if more such cases happened previously, or more will happen in the future - what is needed is firm action, irrespective of the political context.",2015-11-25 18:36:58

282,"The thing is, even citizens cleaning things up requires some basic infrastructure from the state.

There is an open-air sewage around 100 meters away from my house, and I am not allowed to cover it up and build a real sewage line underground (because government alone is allowed to do that). And so it would smell bad all around the area, and citizens are helpless. Thankfully it is not in use so no actual sewage flows there and not much smell is there, but the fact that it is there in the first place is pretty shameful.

Instead of dustbins there is a huge trash box that got filled up within a month and has stayed like that, maybe emptied once in a year (when some lazy official passes by). It looks like a garbage dump site. We are not allowed to build public dustbins as citizens where I live, so we can't clean that up too.

Where there are dustbins, they are so bad in quality and construction, they can either not be opened at all or are simply unusable, or are never cleaned. We cannot touch that too, because removing those fugly dustbins would term us as 'thieves trying to steal public property'. And of course government is the only one allowed to put them up.

The roads and drains in my city are constructed in such a way that even cities in some poor African country look like a glorious heaven. There is no planning, it is as if some 5 year old kid was planning and managing the city for past 60 years. They don't know how to build pavements, they don't know how to build roadside drains, they don't know how to build a proper sewage system, they don't know how to build a potable water pipeline...the entire city has been run by a raving band of demented old mongrels since 1951. And of course the citizens who do know how to actually build cities, are allowed to do nothing.

Swacch Bharat is a good idea, but in practice it has been abysmal where I live. Modi may keep touting honeyed words about how citizen cooperation is good thing and how urban governments will try to do their best - the reality is that Netas from same urban governments do nothing except spitting Paan and littering all over the place, and citizens are not permitted to do anything (because goons will attack them).",2015-11-25 19:52:21

&gt;* ""Suit-boot-ki-sarkar is failing.. it has completely failed...""Gandhi said a group of foreign investors had met him recently and he asked them if they were happy with the Modi government.

&gt;* But they did not believe in conversation.Gandhi raked up the prolonged strike by Film and Television Institute of India(FTII) students over the appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as its Chairman, saying they were told to ""shut up"", Dalit children ""being called dogs"" by a Union Minister (V K Singh) over the Haryana incident and the Dadri killing over beef eating rumours.

http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/four-day-meat-ban-imposed-in-mumbai-during-jain-fasting-festival-115090800405_1.html

&gt;The Shiv Sena-BJP controlled civic body has released the circular based on the previous circulars issued in 1964, 1994 and the Maharashtra government's order in 2004.

&gt;A BMC official told Business Standard: ""There is nothing new in the meat ban. This has been implemented since 1964. The only change is that it is now for four days, including September 10, 13, 17 and 18."" He added till 2013 the ban on meat sale in the metropolis was restricted to two days. 

http://scroll.in/article/755111/meat-ban-irony-how-a-congress-imposed-order-was-cut-to-size-during-bjp-rule

&gt;All the government and municipal resolutions ordering meat bans were actually issued by Congress-led governments in the state 1964, 1994 and 2004.

http://www.dailyo.in/politics/meat-ban-beef-bjp-ruled-states-paryushan-parva-narendra-modi-rss-maharashtra-gujarat-rajasthan-chhattisgarh-haryana/story/1/6293.html

&gt;In Maharashtra, imposition of ban on meat dates back to 1964 when the then Congress-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) enforced it through a resolution for just one day during the Jains' Paryushan Parva. In 1994, the ban was extended by another day. It was in 2004 that the then Congress-NCP government led by Vilasrao Deshmukh endorsed, through a resolution, an additional two-day ban. Hence, the ban was imposed throughout the state for two days while for BMC it was for four days.

What is your source that it was only for Bhayander earlier and not extended under Congress?

&gt;Its not a change in public perception, its a change in the law. Noise may be high, but theres also CLEAR signal driving it.

The signal to noise ratio is pretty low unfortunately. 2 parts real intolerance and 8 parts outrage over intolerance. Doesn't help that the outrage is pretty selective and pretends all intolerance in India comes from one particular party.

&gt;This is after there were clear proposals and ideas to ban alcohol in the state and other similar laws mooted elsewhere.

You're illustrating my point again. There was no real outrage when the Congress actually did impose prohibition in Kerala. Perception matters more than reality, so a communal government that is apparently trying to do communal things will attrack 10x more attention than a secular government that actually does communal things.",2015-11-25 21:03:15

These parties are united against the BJP. Right now they're running the Parliament. They are very much powerful and to deny that would be another such contradiction of these protests.

&gt;UPA was criticised thoroughly in their time. I criticised them, then, I called them corrupt. However, it seems, doing the same to BJP makes me anti national.

The UPA also lashed out at those who were against them. The anti-corruption movement was viciously villified by their ministers and they paid for it. They were milder with their responses but no less bad with apologism(The many supporters who would excuse their corruption by saying people should vote for secularism instead).

&gt; * At a journalism awards ceremony, Khan said there was a growing sense of fear, insecurity and despondency in the country, and that when he discussed things with his filmmaker wife, Kiran Rao, she wondered whether the family should move out of India.

&gt; * Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, for example, famously said that the lynching of the Muslim man would actually hurt India's image and ""amount to policy diversions"".

&gt; * But the fierce public and social media backlash against Aamir Khan by the ruling BJP and supporters of Mr Modi possibly holds up a mirror to hardened positions in today's India.

&gt; * Bollywood actor Anupam Kher, who is an ardent supporter of Mr Modi, said Khan should remember that ""this country has made you Aamir Khan"".

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande have jointly invited over 100 countries to International Solar Initiative to be launched by them on November 30 at Paris climate meet.According to officials, Modi and Hollande have jointly sent written invites to 100 plus countries to International Solar Initiative at Paris Climate Conference COP21 ).The two leaders invited the countries saying that in their view, a coalition of countries joining hands to accelerate the development of solar power would have the potential to contribute significantly towards a common objective of sustainable development, universal energy access and energy security.The alliance will also take the countries closer to their shared vision to bring clean, affordable and renewable energy within the reach of all, the leaders said.The idea of solar alliance was mooted by Modi during the the India-Africa Forum Summit here last month.The alliance is to be named the International Agency for Solar Policy and Application (InSPA) and is aimed at a host of African nations and others located between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.InSPA will act as a platform for countries to share technologies as opposed to relying on costly transfers from the EU and US.The initiative comes against the backdrop of India's recent INDC submission where it committed to having 40 per cent of its energy mix coming from alternative sources by 2030.

&gt; * It has also targeted an ambitious 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022.

I dont agree on that count. Things are moving much much faster than before. But you dont get into 5th gear from 1st straight away.

When Modi won in Gujarat post riots, it was the right wing religious guys who voted for him. 2003 was entirely segmentation of Hindu - Muslim votes. After that things have changed and I am ready to wager that a lot of Muslims even in riot hit Ahmedabad would have voted for Modi - solely on development.

I think or hope that this is what Modi manages to achieve across the country over the years. More than anything else our politics need to be development based.

Nitish won because he was the face of development in Bihar. I doubt Modi's inciting speeches or that old chap saying reservations should be removed mattered.

334,"&gt; That is a such a misogynistic question. 

That is pathetic. Please don't pretend she's isn't a target of sexist comments. How many other incompetent (male) Ministers are said to have been given the job only because they've slept with Modi? 

Also, it is quiet evident that this issue is a clash of egos. She's the  Minister in-charge and instead of convincing her to consider whoever Kakodkar wants to be considered, he goes around and interviews the person in her *absence*. It is a rookie vs veteran clash. She wants to consolidate her position and not be the person who is walked over. She should get over it and appoint someone who is better for India and the students instead of hiding behind the rulebook. Kakodkar can simply put this issue to rest by citing examples of IIT directors who have been appointed by the 'search method'. (and if this is the first time this is done, he *really* shouldn't have gone behind her back and tried convincing her instead) ",2015-11-26 08:28:03
335,"By how it works I mean that have you understood why the minister can't help them? Why investing in his daughter won't make an iota of difference? There's no amount of influence an agri minister has to ensure an investment turns into a unicorn without massive corruption. And Selling to the Indian govt is a PITA. 

And the agri minister cannot close the entry path for a lot of the FDI that modi has been asking for. Should he do that - there would be a huge chilling effect on the investors.

I have little respect/love for Indian VC which acts more like PE anyway, but given the ideas from where they came, the kind of risk-reward posed by the minister, I doubt they would take it kindly.

I personally know of only a few funds which could utilize connections and they would primarily have to work with infrastructure or similar. 

The minister worded his document wrong anyway; there was no threat in the document. But if the opposition had any brains this would blow up in the face of the BJP:

",2015-11-26 08:32:15
336,"I agree with your point that the opposition faced by the NDA government is not allowing them the full control of the ship. Again, I am a firm believer of what Modi brought to the table during and post elections. I am very content with rusty doors being opened in the larger (international) game, giving roles to veterans like Ms. Swaraj and Mr. Doval, which is looking quite promising. 

My point however is focussed towards the internal structure. I am sure we all were riding the wave on how successful the elections went for the BJP party. I feel let down by the effectiveness of Modi's deployed internal team. Things are more or less the same. Yes, opposition is being a nuisance, but like your Iran example that happens everywhere. If they are not able to do politics, then they (domestic policy driven ministers) are not suited for it. I will give an example to summarise my point, if in a football match, with the full stadium, if the referee is not judging fairly, you do not give that particular (valid) excuse at half time. What you do is let the crowd decide, let the crowd get on referee's back. If they would have gone all in and made a conscious effort for they wanted, I believe a ""winner"" team would have achieved that or would have won the Bihar election, after the crowd takes stock of the realities. I know that many don't expect the common public in states like Bihar (no offences meant, but in relation to literacy rate) to act on rational, but they gave you the votes in General Elections, didn't they?

Another point, the Swach Bharat Abhiyaan (for which Rahul was made into the butt of jokes yesterday, and deservedly so, the over entitled s.o.b) was such a fresh though, and could have become one of the major victories of his tenure. The Abhiyaan which initially grabbed the attention of our entire country, should have had more funding and persistent actioning, rather that it resulting into a fizzled out revolution and PR exploit.

only cuz jdu and rjd and cong fought general election alone, their cumulative vote share (had they fought lok sabha together) would have ensured their win in lok sabha in bihar...

secondly i get the feeling ur overestimating the speed of change... this is a democracy, growing at 7-8% is no joke, and u still want faster change... i mean cmon people have to get realistic. It's just like burma, people their think that suu kyi is gna be some miracle, the truth is it takes decades to change. Korea took 50 years of fast growth and change (and it started much more well off) to become industrialized. China has been the fastest changing country (and doesn't have to deal with democracy either) for the past 35 years, and yet it is no where near close to being an industrialized nation, ie first world. People have unrealistic expectations which are not gna happen in 5 years... 10 years... even 20 years... at the best it will still take india 30-40 years of high speed growth to become an advanced economy. what the focus should be on is the path the government is setting for the future. for instance the liberalization of the economy in 90's was a massive step which impacted india's future. Even swach bharat abhiyaan's visible impact will take at least 5-10 years to show, and that is only if the gov focuses on it... and people too change... we should judge modi on how his actions will impact india in the long run not on immediate change.",2015-11-26 09:20:41

India has nothing to with the problem: Nepal hasn't handled its own people too well and India has just taken an ideological stance, nothing more.

Nepalese government has taken Chinese support to overcome internal resistance (the road blockades) but that just sets it up for future internal issues. China won't be able to help there, and Nepal will have spent the political capital with India.

IMHO Modi government could have played it better and not cared about Madhesis, but I guess Bihar elections forced its hand, Still, there were more tactful approaches to take and Modi/Sushma Swaraj didn't. They're not being evil or bad, but non-Machiavellian.",2015-11-26 23:59:40

&gt; * Making it easier for some 18 million state and local government employees, like Taneja, to save more, the government pay commission, which reviews public sector salaries every few years, has recommended an increase of several billion dollars.

&gt; * New Delhi still hopes higher incomes, lower inflation and a push to create more than 190 million new bank accounts will boost gross savings back above 30 percent, but it is unlikely to hit the peak savings rate of over 36 percent soon.

&gt;* According to sources, a YSR Congress party MP reached the Tirupati airport about 20 to 25 minutes before flight departure time with some of his relatives to board AI 541 to Delhi (where Parliament is in session and MPs are supposed to be in attendance) via Hyderabad.

&gt;* However given the clout that politician wields and given the fact that AI is a government organisation, the employee had till late on Thursday night not filed a police complaint.

&gt;* The AI station manager was in the security hold area, supervising the flight's preparedness for take off as boarding counter had been closed.

&gt;* ""AI chairman Ashwani Lohani has specifically directed that no flight should be delayed for any non-technical reason like accommodating VVIPs.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: I&amp;B ministry officials have ruled out any move to remove Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC) chief Pahlaj Nihalani who has been dogged by several controversies recently.Nihalani's work shows no major departure from the way the board has functioned in previous years, official data shows.Out of 2,174 movies that came up for clearance at CBFC since Nihalani took charge in January 2014, 2,124 were cleared at the initial examining stage, according to the CBFC data.

&gt; * This data, which has also been sent to I&amp;B ministry, shows 50 movies were sent to examining committee of the Censor Board for review.

&gt; * Four out of these movies were sent to Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) which didn't clear one film.CBFC chief Nihalani watched and reviewed only 10 out of these 50 movies, which didn't include Spectre, the latest James Bond movie that had undergone cuts recently, owing to a kissing scene, an official said.

&gt; * The number of movies cleared every year from 2010 to 2014 when the UPA-appointed Censor Board was in charge, was similar to that of cleared under Nihalani, the official said, adding that this indicates no change in the working pattern of the board.Ministry officials said they have received complaints from some CBFC members about Nihalani's autocratic ways of working.Though the ministry has officially denied interfering in the Censor Board controversy, CBFC officials said it was trying to ensure the board worked in a unified way.MoS (I&amp;B) Rajyavardhan Rathore had recently asked the CBFC board members to work as one team, asserting that the Censor Board should not be used to promote just one person's ideology.Nihalani told ET that ""only movie that was denied clearance by the CBFC was also rejected by the tribunal.""

The politics is delicious.

Congress is being called by the ~~party~~ person who crushed them. They aren't leader of opposition because of how badly the polls went.

Congress should be relatively demoralized in the younger ranks - only the old guard may have some confidence in a resurgence seeing as they've gone through many eras and changes in politics.

Sensing the vaccum many of the regional parties are making plays for a national position if not for their own aggrandizement, then as a bargaining chip.

Calling Sonia AND MMS means that congress can get a chance to build political capital. If they agree to it, it means that they can have a *useable* seat on the negotiation table.

But that means allying with their nemesis. This can be a huge PR hit. Just by shutting up they've left the BJP to be it's own enemy.


 If they are playing the long game of letting anti incumbency do to the BJP what it did to them, working publicly with Modi is a double edged sword.

He blathers on about how corrupt the Youth Congress is, a group he has been the leader of for half a decade now.

He blathers on about dynasty politics, while fucker himself is where he is only because of dynasty. Under his expert guidance, the Congress was wiped out of some 5 major states, many of which they were ruling / in alliance, the Congress sunk to its lowest in the LS, and only Bihar (after some 7-8 successive defeats) could be seen as a victory and yet he is the undisputed leader of the Congress.

In any organisation, anywhere in the world, if it was even 1% meritocracy, fucker would be out on the streets.

Now, moving on - he is lying through his teeth when he says that mics were switched off, if they were, it would have made the news for weeks on end. If anything, the last two sessions, Congress only stalled parliament and didn't even attempt a debate.

Sure dude, everybody who is at a Modi speech is a paid shill, everybody who has voted BJP in every single election since 1970 is a RSS hand - keep deluding yourself. You might hate him (which is fine, it is your prerogative), but Modi is by far the post popular pan Indian leader we have had after Indira (before emergency) and opinion poll after opinion poll suggests this.

By 2019, the pristine Congress and the stalwart, loved General Pappu will be ready to take over the mantle, and thus will begin another sordid chapter in Congress run Indian history.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Jamia Millia Islamia has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the chief guest at its annual convocation this year.The varsity has, however, not received any confirmation from the PMO regarding the same.

&gt; * We had extended an invitation to him earlier this month to be the chief guest at our annual convocation.

&gt; * We have not received any communication from the PMO so far,"" the university spokesman Mukesh Ranjan said.Last year, President Pranab Mukherjee was the chief guest at the convocation of the university, which was founded in 1920 and became a central university in 1988.The invitation assumes significance as Modi, who has not visited the university so far, had attacked Jamia in 2008 after the Batla House encounter in September that year.Addressing a gathering in Gujarat, he had said, ""There is a university in Delhi called Jamia Millia Islamia.

&gt; * This Jamia Millia is being run on government money and it is daring to spend money on lawyers to get terrorists out of jail.

490,"CAG Blows the Lid on Rs 100,000 Crore Rice Milling Scam

---

&gt;* An audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, to which Cobrapost and The Wire are privy, has put the magnitude of the financial loss to the public exchequer at more than Rs 10,000 crore a year.

&gt;* Since millions of tons of rice are processed every year, many top-notch millers are developing stand-alone by-products units for a sustainable stream of revenue catering to both the domestic and export markets.

&gt;* Of particular cause for concern is the fact that successive governments  led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi persisted with a milling policy that deprives the nation of enormous revenue despite knowing the reality.

&gt;* Even if government is not bothered about the loss of revenue caused by assigning zero-value to paddy by-products, what is inexplicable is its failure to even tax the additional income that millers earn from the sale of these by-products.

&gt;* Millers are clearly afraid of losing their monopoly rights over the by-products and a very profitable business if a new policy is put in place. Sources at the CAG are candid enough to admit that the political will needed to re-structure the existing tariff mechanism is completely lacking.

491,"&gt; Do you really think this fuckwit is capable of leading this country? 

No, but my belief in his competence or otherwise has nothing to do with heaping him with abuse for something every politician in the world does. 

 Who ""drives"" an image makeover etc is irrelevant, and is in any case, impossible to determine. How do we know Modi ""drives"" his image building activities? Maybe Adani does. Maybe the Flying Sphagetti Monster does. Who cares? this kind of nitpicking is not conducive to a useful conversation.  

RaGa is easy to target, without insinuating he is doing something immoral/unethical by trying to acquire/refurbish an image.

There are good ways to criticize people, this is not one of them. You are reducing yourself to [Internet Hindus](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/social-media-internet-cyber-hindu-twitter-narendra-modi/1/321267.html) on twitter and facebook. What you're doing is just lazy and if you can't think of a good way to criticize someone, it's sometimes better to not open your mouth.

This reminds me of how the British tabloids criticized Ed Milliband. They stooped to the level of hounding him like paparazzi to dig up things to make fun of him with:
