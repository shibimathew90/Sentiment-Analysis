Days after the economic wing of the RSS wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
against introducing a cervical cancer vaccine in the universal immunisation
programme (UIP), the Ministry of Health has taken a decision in principle not
to do so. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in
India.

The matter is still under consideration of the technical advisory body on
immunisation but highly placed sources in the ministry say that regardless of
what the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) decides, a
vaccine against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) will not become a part of UIP
anytime soon. An NTAGI subcommittee had recommended that India should
introduce HPV. “We are not going ahead with it now,” said a top health
ministry functionary in reply to a question on HPV introduction.

**Also Read | Why the vaccine against cervical cancer is not such a simple shot**

After the subcommittee constituted to look into HPV introduction recommended
that it be introduced, the NTAGI discussed the matter in a meeting on December
19 but did not reach a decision. During the run-up to that meeting, though, as
news emerged about the subcommittee’s recommendation, the RSS wing Swadeshi
Jagran Manch wrote to the PM citing safety and cost concerns.

In the letter, SJM national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan wrote: “It is our
concern that this programme will divert scarce resources from more worthwhile
health initiatives diverting it to this vaccine of doubtful utility and that
its adverse effects will erode confidence in the national immunisation
programme and thereby expose children unnecessarily to the risk of more
serious vaccine-preventable disease.”

In India, currently the vaccine is marketed by two companies, Gardasil and
Glaxosmithkline, and is administered largely in the private sector, if the
doctor feels the need or if the patient demands it. The vaccine currently
costs less than $5 a dose.

“Swadeshi Jagran Manch requests you to stop this move to introduce Human
Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in India and we recommend the strongest action
against groups that pervert science, which brings ignominy to the scientific
community in the country and sells the country to vested interests,” the
letter added.

HPV comprises a group of more than 150 viruses that cause papilloma or warts
in parts of the body, including genital areas. They spread by skin-to-skin
contact and are responsible for a number of diseases, including cancers,
though they are most commonly associated with cancer of the cervix (neck of
the uterus). HPV is a necessary cause for cervical cancer but not sufficient
cause. WHO recommends HPV vaccination for the prevention of cervical cancer.
Its 2017 position paper on HPV identifies the primary target population as
girls aged aged 9-14, prior to becoming sexually active.

According to a 2015 article in the International Journal of Women’s Health,
“Every year in India, 122,844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and
67,477 die from the disease. India has a population of 432.2 million women
aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cancer. It is the second
most common cancer in women aged 15-44 years. India also has the highest age
standardised incidence of cervical cancer in South Asia at 22, compared to
19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.”

**PM Modi praises 21-year-old’s ski win, her father taught him paragliding**

Written by

Updated: January 11, 2018 7:02 am

Aanchal Thakur with the medal she won in Turkey, her father with PM Narendra
Modi in the late-’90s

Early Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to
congratulate Aanchal Thakur from Himachal Pradesh for winning India’s first
medal at an international skiing event. At the 21-year-old’s home in Manali,
Aanchal’s father Roshan Lal Thakur was left wondering if the Prime Minister
knew who she really was.

In November, while campaigning in Manali for the Himachal elections, Modi
spoke in public about how he became a fan of paragliding when he visited
Solang two decades ago — and how “a Thakur” was his first instructor.

“Probably, he doesn’t know that he had tweeted the name of the girl whose
father’s name he mentioned in Manali two months ago. I was among the crowd but
did not get an opportunity to meet him,” says Thakur.

On Tuesday, Thakur’s daughter bagged bronze at the Alpine Ejder 3200 Cup in
Turkey, a tournament recognised by the International Skiing Federation.

Modi tweeted: “Well done @alleaanchal for winning an international medal in
skiing! The entire nation is ecstatic on your historic accomplishment at the
FIS International Skiing Competition in Turkey. Wishing you the very best for
your future endeavours.”

According to Thakur, Modi tried his hand at paragliding in an institute run by
Thakur in 1997, during a political tour to Solang. In the late 90s, Modi was
BJP’s in-charge of Himachal.

“A local leader brought Modiji to show him the paragliding facility. The
ground was slushy because it had been raining. He wanted to give it a try but
I said he couldn’t because you need a firm ground for the run-up. But he was
adamant. He tried it and he was hooked,” says Thakur.

Aanchal has never met Modi, but has heard about her father’s connection. “I
never imagined that the Prime Minister would tweet about me. I can’t believe
it. I hope this brings more recognition to Winter Olympics. I owe my success
to my father,” she says.

Being a paragliding instructor was actually Thakur’s summer job. In the
winters, the 1989 national skiing champion used to take to the snow-capped
slopes of Manali. His son Himanshu represented India at the 2014 Winter
Olympics in Sochi.

“After our first meeting, Modiji used to come practically every month, and
he’d bring lots of people along… On one visit, he travelled with a security
team and on reaching the academy, encouraged his bodyguards to have a go at
paragliding,” says Thakur.

Thakur says he was in touch with Modi for a while after he became the chief
minister of Gujarat. In 2012, he says, Modi called to ask him to visit
Gujarat’s Saputara, where an adventure sports institute was being set up.

**Unique question: Will we have a life after Aadhaar?** 

 ______ 
If you are of a certain age, and not one of the millennial Indians who will
turn 18 this year and be eligible to vote, you might remember watching The
Net, the 1995 thriller starring Sandra Bullock as a cybersecurity expert who
gets into a whole lot of trouble with cyberterrorists, who erase her identity
and cut her off from her home, job and credit cards.

Or you might remember the 1998 movie Enemy of the State, in which Will Smith
plays a lawyer who inadvertently gets caught up in a U.S. National Security
Agency (NSA) plot and has his own personal life wiped clean, his bank accounts
frozen, and his marriage nearly wrecked.

Both movies portrayed the Internet at its most sinister. But that was two
decades ago. The appetite and the ability of the state to monitor every
citizen's life down to her minutest activity has enormously expanded since
then. In 2007, the NSA launched a program called PRISM, which gathered and
analysed Internet traffic from around the world, ostensibly aimed at thwarting
terrorist attacks but also encompassing U.S. citizens.

Both PRISM and another NSA program called Boundless Informant were exposed by
Edward Snowden in 2013.

The noise and fury over India's unique identity number programme

Aadhaar

is growing by the day. On January 17, a five-judge constitution bench of the
Supreme Court will begin hearings on the pleas against Aadhaar in the
petitions clubbed under Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) vs Union of India. Last
August, these petitions triggered a review by a larger nine-judge constitution
bench of the concept of privacy.

In six historic, erudite, well-reasoned and unanimous opinions spanning 547
pages, the Supreme Court overturned its own past rulings and unequivocally
declared that ""The right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the
right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the
freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.""

The privacy judgment makes for fascinating reading. It ranges across Indian
and foreign constitutional jurisprudence, as well as international privacy
laws, while also examining the meaning and implications of the global
information-based society we live in. The author of the substantive portion of
the judgment, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, explains the essential nature of
privacy.

""Privacy postulates the reservation of a private space for the individual,
described as the right to be let alone,"" Justice Chandrachud writes. ""The
concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The ability of an
individual to make choices lies at the core of the human personality. The
notion of privacy enables the individual to assert and control the human
element which is inseparable from the personality of the individual ...""

One would hope that by spelling out its ringing protection for the
individual's privacy, the Supreme Court has presaged its ruling in the Aadhaar
case. But that is not a given.

The Justice B.N. Srikrishna committee, set up last July to draft a data
protection and privacy bill, has proposed setting up a data-protection
authority as well as audits and penalties. But I'm not holding my breath: We
can add layer upon layer of regulations, it's the leaky implementation that
defeats ordinary mortals.

I am not blindly opposed to a unique (and uniform) identity system for all
residents in India. I have lived and worked in several countries where
important transactions and activities were identifiable with my unique number.
The same ID number appeared on my bank statements, driving licence, income-tax
returns and residence permits.

But that is where it stopped. In India, we already have an untidy array of
identities: our voter cards, our Permanent Account Numbers, our driving
licences, and our government-employee and armed forces ID cards. Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, after first passionately opposing Aadhaar when he was
Gujarat chief minister, has now mandated that Aadhaar must be linked to
everything, from our PAN cards to our bank accounts, investments, property
transactions, mobile phones and much else. We have been bombarded with
coercive and threatening reminders to do so or be left penniless and sans
communication. Although the deadline for compliance has been extended to March
31, the Supreme Court's Aadhaar ruling may come too late for the recalcitrant.

Aadhaar was originally designed as a voluntary enrolment for residents of
India. Section 7 of the Aadhar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other
Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act of 2016 says verification of an
individual's identity will be necessary for transfers from the Consolidated
Fund of India (i.e. the state exchequer). In reality, the demand for Aadhaar
is now being used by growing numbers of service providers.

Aadhaar was aimed at eliminating corruption in subsidies and enabling direct
transfers to beneficiaries. In practice, its biometric (fingerprint and iris)
verification has been found not to be fool-proof. As The Tribune reporter
proved last week, unscrupulous agents are already peddling access to the
database of names, addresses, email IDs and so on (though not so far of
biometrics). How much longer will it take for our most intimate details to
fall into the paws of those who do not give a fig about our lives?

Much of the hand-wringing about Aadhaar has come from people who will not
actually need to use Aadhaar regularly. The system's weaknesses will hit the
poorest the most. Already, from outrages like refusals to issue death
certificates to refusing a retired serviceman his pension to blocking a young
man from obtaining a 'hall ticket' for an important examination, Aadhaar is
proving exclusionary for the people it was meant to benefit the most.

Lawyer Arvind Datar, who is appearing for one of the petitioners in the
Supreme Court, cites examples like an elderly man near Manipal who could not
authenticate his ration card because the ridges on his fingerprints had
changed with age. This man had a fistful of other identifications, but was
forced to travel to another town for iris authentication. ""This is extreme
bullying,"" says Datar.

The Supreme Court is not likely to abolish the programme: more than 1.19
billion Aadhaars have been generated, and over 15 billion transactions already
authenticated using Aadhaar. The big question is: what will all our data be
used for?

In The Net, Sandra Bullock's character is more exposed because she does
everything on her computer, including ordering pizza online, and is barely
known to her neighbours. In a tongue-in-cheek 2013 review, Wired magazine
wrote the main discovery was that ""our entire lives are recorded on computers,
from our work to our taste in movies. In 1995, this was a shocking problem
that people had to learn to deal with. In 2013, it's basically how Facebook
works.""

In a 1934 interview, Mahatma Gandhi said: ""I look upon an increase of the
power of the State with the greatest fear, because although while apparently
doing good by minimizing exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by
destroying individuality, which lies at the root of all progress.""

Just like a typical service shop company, make something shoddy, sell it quickly, and then when the customers claim keep on fixing the bugs.

Of course, Modi and co. are to be equally blamed, that after inheriting this system, they got greedier and started linking everything to it..

**Britain doubles export backing for India** 

 ______ 
LONDON: The UK government today announced the doubling of its national credit
support for UK businesses exporting to India, during the visit of Commerce and
Industry Minister

Suresh Prabhu

.

Prabhu held talks with Britain's international trade minister, Liam Fox, in
London as part of the 12th meeting of the

UK-India Joint Economic and Trade Committee

(JETCO) to discuss greater cooperation between the two countries and identify
barriers to trade and investment.

As part of the deliberations, Fox announced that the UK's national export
credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), has more than doubled its financial
support to enable UK businesses to trade with India.

This means 4.5 billion pounds will now be available for UK companies exporting
to India as well as Indian buyers of UK goods and services.

The minister said the UK government would work closely with India to break
down barriers to boosting trade, which includes the latest doubling of trade
finance support for UK exporters and Indian buyers of British goods and
services.

UKEF support is made available in Indian rupees, allowing Indian buyers to
access finance in their own currency and making sourcing from the UK even more
competitive.

He said, ""India is the world's seventh-largest economy and the fourth largest
investor into the UK, while UK investment in India grew by 8.8 per cent in the
year to 2016.

""For the first time in 40 years, the UK is preparing for its own independent
trade policy, and expanding our bilateral trade and investment with India will
be central to that task. It's in our shared interest to boost prosperity,
generate jobs, develop skills, and enhance the competitiveness of both our
countries,"" he said.

According to the UK's Department for International Trade (DIT), the India-UK
trading relationship was worth 15.7 billion pounds in 2016, with UK exports to
India amounting to 5.8 billion pounds.

Indian foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK was worth 1.5 billion pounds
in 2016, while UK investment into India rose to 13.2 billion pounds in 2016.

""There is huge potential to expand bilateral trade and investment as the UK
prepares to leave the European Union (EU),"" DIT said.

UK and Indian businesses, including UK engineering consultancy Arup and Indian
infrastructure firm Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&amp;amp;FS),
also met alongside the JETCO to discuss ways of boosting cooperation in
growing sectors such as advanced manufacturing and smart cities.

While the UK cannot strike any new bilateral pacts until the official

Brexit

process in complete, the two countries had agreed to set up a new joint
working group on trade at the last meeting of JETCO in New Delhi in November
2016 to work towards removing barriers to trade.

The meeting in London was aimed at building on progress made by the UK-India
trade working group.

""A lot of interest and positivity has been generated in London today by the
Joint Trade Review. Initiated in mid-2016 by the Indian and UK governments and
aimed at establishing immediate areas of improving trade, it is still at its
early stages.

""Nonetheless, there are already really positive signs and, hence, anticipation
for a renewed and ever deepening India-UK economic partnership,"" said UK India
Business Council CEO Richard Heald, who was present at the discussions here.

The UKIBC welcomed a focus on food and drink, pharma, healthcare and Medtech,
and IT and ITES as the three core sectors for closer India-UK cooperation.

""There are huge opportunities in these three areas. These are areas where we
can leverage our individual strengths and at the same time build on those
collaborations which already exist,"" he said.

The JETCO forms a precursor to the

Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting

(CHOGM), to be hosted by the UK in April and expected to be attended by Prime
Minister

Narendra Modi

.

Heald highlighted that such ministerial visits on both sides are an
opportunity to reflect on the changing dynamics of the 52-member bloc and ""to
make a step change in the multilateral/bilateral relationship that underpin
the Commonwealth""

**""Go To Pakistan Border, Won't Give Land In South Mumbai"": Nitin Gadkari Tells Navy** 

 ______ 
Mr Gadkari today said the government plans to bring 10,000 seaplanes into
operation (File)

**Mumbai: **

Accusing the Indian Navy of ""holding up developmental projects"" in India's
financial capital, Union minister Nitin Gadkari today said he would not give
them an ""inch of land"" in the posh south Mumbai area. In presence of senior
naval officials, including the Chief of Western Command, at a function in
Mumbai, Mr Gadkari said, ""We are the government. The Navy and the defence
ministry are not the government"".

The outburst of Mr Gadkari, who has Shipping and Water Resources among his
portfolio bouquet, came after the Navy refused permission for a jetty to
launch seaplane services and a floatel on grounds of security. Citing the
Navy's decision, the Bombay high court also turned down the operator's appeal.

The Navy, Mr Gadkari said in his address, ""came to me seeking a plot of
land... I will not give them even an inch of land, please don't come again...
Everyone wants to build quarters and flats on south Mumbai's prime land. We do
respect you (Navy), but you should go to the Pakistan border and do
patrolling.""

Everybody, he said, wants to build quarters in south Mumbai's prime land, but
only a few important, senior officials should live there.

Senior officers, including Western Naval Command chief Vice Admiral Girish
Luthra, were present at the programme where Mr Gadkari was laying the
foundation stone for an international Miami-style cruise terminal.

__ Comments

The blow to the ferry project is a bump in the Narendra Modi government's plan
to optimize the country's waterways in view of the cramped land routes and the
high cost of expanding them. During the Gujarat elections, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi had unveiled the government's plans on this front before he
famously took off from Sabarmati river on a sea plane.

Mr Gadkari today said the government plans to bring 10,000 seaplanes into
operation in the country over the next two years.

**Prakash Ambedkar: Fringe Hindu groups can finish off RSS if not reined in**

**Mumbai:** Prakash Ambedkar, president of the political party Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh and a former member of Parliament, shot back into the political mainstream when he became the face of Dalit resistance in Maharashtra in the wake of the Bhima-Koregaon violence near Pune on 1 January. But Ambedkar, the 63-year-old grandson of Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar, is not confining himself to the Dalit constituency. In fact, in an interview at ‘Rajgruha’, the Hindu Colony home in Mumbai which Bhimrao Ambedkar built and lived in back in the 1930s, Prakash Ambedkar said he was “diluting his Dalit agenda to expose the fringe Hindu organizations which have the potential to finish off the mainstream Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) if not reined in and regulated”. Edited excerpts:

**After the Bhima-Koregaon violence, you have named two organizations—Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan and Samasta Hindu Aaghadi (Front for All Hindus)—and demanded action against them for causing the anti-Dalit violence. What makes you so sure of their involvement?**

There is clear evidence on the ground which proves the involvement of these
organizations... like the identity of people who came from districts like
Sangli, Satara, and Kolhapur, to Bhima-Koregaon, around 1 January. If the
investigating agencies connect these dots, it will become obvious that these
were the organizations which not only instigated violence but carried it out.

**Who are these organisations and where do their supporters come from?**

These are fringe and unscrutinized groups. Each state has its own set of such
unregulated groups. Within states also, they have their regional pockets of
influence. They are not the mainstream organizations which are open to public
scrutiny and by their acts and statements they put the RSS in bad light. I
have my differences with the RSS but it is a mainstream organization open to
public scrutiny by itself or through the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). But
these Hindu groups are fringe elements who are trying to take control of the
RSS itself or finish it off. This is a battle of supremacy between the
mainstream RSS and the Hindutva fringe. The biggest threat to RSS comes from
these fringe groups only. They need to be identified, scrutinized, and banned
if needed, and their functionaries need to be arrested. Or else they will
finish the RSS off.

**Why do you think the RSS or the Narendra Modi-led government has not acted against these elements? Does the RSS intend to act at all?**

Given the statements made by RSS functionaries post the Bhima-Koregaon
violence, I would think that they understand the threat these groups pose. But
they cannot probably act now since many of these groups may have integrated
with each other or the process of integration may have reached a critical
stage. All these years, the RSS was aware that such radical groups are
cropping up but it did not act against them because it was not politically
rewarding to do so then.

**You say you have taken on this role to expose the Hindu fringe across the nation. But aren’t you diluting your Dalit agenda?**

Yes I am and there already are grumblings in the Dalit camp about it. But
someone has to do this job of exposing this fringe because it threatens the
rule of law, democracy, and the Constitution itself. I am diluting my agenda
but I am not giving it up.

**Are you seeking co-operation from other political parties? The Left parties may have their reservations since this work could be considered a favour to the RSS.**

There are several non-political organizations which are helping. I am in talks
with the Left also but it has not joined so far.

**Do you think the Dalit anger in the last three years has produced a new Dalit leadership?**

Yes, but leaders like Jignesh Mevani will succeed if they are able to form an
alliance. If they come alone and try to build personal leadership, they will
fail because it is this model which has in the past ruptured the non-Congress,
non-BJP politics.

**Do you see the Dalit anger impacting the upcoming assembly polls in several states?**

It will have a huge impact in Karnataka for sure. It is not only about Dalits
and there are smaller OBC (Other Backward Classes) groups which are angry. In
Karnataka, if Deve Gowda agrees to work with us, there will be a triangular
fight—Congress, BJP, and us with the Janata Dal (Secular). But if Deve Gowda
wants to go his own way, there will be a quadrangular fight in which we may
emerge as not only the kingmaker but even the king ourselves. The impact will
be carried on to the 2019 general elections.

**Kannada outfits call for Karnataka bandh on January 25 over Mahadayi water sharing** 

 ______ 
Pro-Kannada outfits have given a call for a Karnataka Bandh on January 25 to
press for the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Mahadayi
river water sharing row between the state and neighbouring Goa.

Vatal Nagaraj, leader of the Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha (KCVP), a pro-
Kannada outfit, claimed that about 2,000 pro-Kannada outfits backed the bandh
call.

He said the organisations had decided to speak to government officers and
employees, lorry owners, fuel service stations, education institutions and
appeal to them to cooperate in ensuring that the bandh is a success.

The Kannada film industry has already agreed to support the bandh, Nagaraj
said.

The Kannada organisations have also decided to show black flags to Modi when
he visits Karnataka on January 28 for the concluding ceremony of the BJP’s
Nava Karnataka Parivarthana Yatra,a state-wide programme against the Congress
government.

Karnataka has locked horns with Goa over the Mahadayi river sharing issue to
supply water for Hubballi and Dharwad towns for drinking water through Kalasa-
Banduri canal.

Recently, Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar said he would go by the decision
taken by the Mahadayi river water sharing tribunal. Earlier, he had written to
state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa lending his support to resolve the Mahadayi
river water sharing issue.

Karnataka is seeking release of 7.56 tmcft water by Goa from the Mahadayi
river for the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project, being undertaken to improve the
drinking water supply to Hubballi-Dharwad and districts of Belagavi and Gadag
in the northern region.

The Kalasa-Banduri Nala (diversion) project involves building barrages across
Kalasa and Banduri, tributaries of the Mahadayi river, to divert 7.56 tmcft to
the Malaprabha river which supplies drinking water needs of the region.

On December 27 last year, a bandh was observed in five north Karnataka
districts over the same issue following a call by farmer groups.

**RTI reveals expenses of PM Modi' wardrobe not borne by GOI** 

 ______ 
Applying brakes on the wardrobe controversy of Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

the prime minister office has clarified that personal attire of PM is not
borne by the government office. The information was sought by RTI activist

Rohit Sabharwal

who sought information about expenditure on wardrobe of PMs since 1998 in
which Atal Bihari Vajpayee and

Manmohan Singh

are also included.

The RTI activist Sabharwal had sought the information from PMO to give details
about the expenditure done (year wise) on the clothing of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
from March 19 1998 till May 22 2004. Similar information was sought for
Manmohan Singh during his tenure from May 22, 2004 till May 26 2014. For the
PM Narendra Modi the information was sought from May 26 2014 till now.

The PMO in the reply has clearly stated that the information sought is
personal in nature and does not form part of office records. The PMO office
also mentioned that it may be noted that expenditure on personal attire of PM
is not borne on government account.

After receiving the reply the RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal said that many
people assume that huge amount of expenditure is borne by the union government
upon the attire of the PM but now from this RTI reply it is clear that
government is not bearing any expenditure of the PM's Clothing. He said that
he had filed this RTI on December 9 2017 just to explore whether allegations
levelled by the political parties especially the

Aam Aadmi Party

(AAP) supremo

Arvind Kejriwal

on the PM are right or wrong. He said earlier he had decided to file RTI only
for PM Modi but then he thought he should ask about others also so as to get
comparison as who is spending how much on clothing.

State general secretary of

Congress

Pawan Dewan said that it might be right that government is not spending
anything on PM Modi' wardrobe. ""These expensive suits can be gifted to him,""
said he while adding that instead of paying attention towards the country he
is more concerned about his looks. Regarding former PM Manmohan Singh he said
that there was no controversy over his clothes and he was a simple man.

Co-president of AAP

Aman Arora

however commented he is not aware of others but regarding Modi PM office might
not be providing the actual information. He said moreover he is PM and nobody
can ask him for money which is understood.

State general secretary of BJP Jeevan Gupta said that RTI information has
revealed the fact that opposition parties were raising hue and cry about
nothing and since they do not have other issue they comment on the wardrobe of
PM. He said that if PM of country is wearing good clothes then there is
nothing wrong in this as he is representing India. Gupta said that he had once
worn a designer suit which was auctioned and amount was used for swachh bharat
mission works.

**The opposite of ‘divide and rule’, it is also PM Modi’s mission statement** 

 ______ 
** By MJ Akbar   
**

It is unsurprising that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is an avowed
disciple of Swami Vivekananda, should have placed gender reform at the heart
of governance. The passage of a

triple talaq bill

in Lok Sabha and the reinstitution of pilgrimage rights for Muslim women are
strong inclusive links in a chain that started within weeks of Modi taking
office in 2014. Vivekananda famously described Muhammad as the Prophet of
equality in race, caste, colour and gender. It took a disciple to remember
that.

Gender emancipation was central to Vivekananda's vision of a New India - a
symbol of national regeneration that he placed into public discourse. ""The
best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women,""
said Vivekananda. ""When woman is no longer oppressed,"" he added during umpteen
sermons, ""she will become a lion."" He even wanted women to become partners in
sacred space, a radical proposition in an age where priesthood had become the
jealously guarded preserve of men. Analysing the past, he argued that India
began to regress when women were turned into an ""object of blame for
everything"". In his cosmic and temporal view, the first manifestation of God
was the hand that rocked the cradle.

The wheels of change set in motion by Modi in 2014 are on course towards a new
horizon. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is a doctrine of inclusion, seeking to bring
all those who are marginalised because of inherited problems like caste,
creed, gender or wealth into the arc of prosperity and social liberation.
'Sab' does not merely include women; women are central to this narrative,
which believes that they can play a decisive role in elimination of that
historic curse, harsh poverty.

The starting point was Jan Dhan, the project that opened bank accounts for
over 300 million people who had never seen the inside of a bank before.

Jan Dhan

minimised the role of middlemen with their sticky fingers in direct benefit
transfers, an endemic problem that had substantially depleted actual resources
meant for the impoverished.

A transformative element of Jan Dhan's design was opening the banking system
to women who had never seen the inside of a bank before. About 53% of the Jan
Dhan accounts or over 162 million, were opened by women at the urban or rural
base of the economic pyramid. For the first time women from Dalit, tribal and
backward class communities who were struggling for a living, had found the
means for an economic empowerment project whose full implications would become
clear at next stage: collateral-free MUDRA loans.

Sensing opportunity and encouraged by government, women took an astonishing
75% of the total number of Mudra loans to start their own small enterprises,
worth well over Rs 2 lakh crore. In the last two years, women of the poorest
families also received another Rs 51,000 crore from the

National Rural Livelihoods Mission

. The PM's housing plan for the impoverished has a trigger clause: a woman
head of family can get a loan in her name. But a man must share ownership of
the house with his wife, unless he is a widower or bachelor.

Schemes to improve the health and welfare of women have become signature
landmarks of the Modi government.

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

has improved rural sanitation coverage from 71% to 93% while 1,472 cities have
become Open Defecation Free. Separate toilets for girls are being built in all
government schools. In his Independence Day speech of 2014, Modi startled the
country by talking about the impact of absent toilets on women's health.

Every pregnant woman and lactating mother (apart from those receiving help
within the organised sector) now gets maternity benefits. This has the
collateral advantage of persuading mothers to register births, leading to
immunisation, life-saving vaccinations and better healthcare. The just amended
Maternity Benefit Act extends maternity leave to 26 weeks, and ensures that
every company with more than 50 employees has creche facilities.

More than 3.12 crore indigent women have received free LPG connections,
releasing them from the drudgery and danger of smoke-choked kitchens. This
number will keep growing. Physical security of women is a major priority.
Institutional mechanisms have been created like One Stop Centres; Nirbhaya
Fund has been expanded; compensation for victims has been enhanced; railways
is working to provide 24-hour security through CCTV at over 900 stations.

Government is pushing for more women in police forces to help victims of
violence; eight states have ensured 33% reservation for women in police. A
programme called Gender Champion to encourage gender sensitivity among the
young is now part of the curriculum of 100 universities and 145 colleges. The
PM has personally led the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao initiative, to address the
child sex ratio and promote education for girls so that they can become equal
claimants for jobs.

Justice for SC/STs and OBCs is another area where legislation, coupled with
administrative action, works towards social justice and economic inclusion.
The list of welfare schemes is long. Nor has government hesitated to take
tough measures in the interest of the vulnerable.

Our social history is replete with division, along the familiar lines of caste
and creed, which our colonial masters were quick to exploit. Unfortunately,
this inheritance of 'divide and rule' seeped rather quickly after freedom into
our democratic polity, encouraged by the first beneficiaries of political
power. Gender remained what might be called the 'silent division'. Modi is
multiplying gender opportunity to end this comparative exclusion of women
through social and economic empowerment.

Sometimes the meaning of a phrase acquires sharper clarity through the mirror
image. The opposite of 'divide and rule' is, quite obviously, 'unite and
serve'. 'Unite and serve' is Modi's mission statement.

62,"see... media, people etc who were left leaning and against BJP were really interested in this case and were putting blame on BJP/Sangh/Modi even though the Govt in K'taka is congress. Sure, that blame game went on for many months. Even some congress politicians put blame on BJP for this. LOL. 

I mean, no wanted to hold congress govt for responsibility but busy blaming modi. Her friend Prakash Raj, raised voice but then again it felt it was against Modi but not against Govt or the system.

the police also tried to link it with Goa based Sanathan Shit, but they failed. Sanathan chutiyas were did involved in the murder of Kalburgi. So, they wanted to link Lankesh's murder so that religion angle can be brought. but police failed.

sometime in october, a k'taka minister said that they have identified the killers but won't release the details as it jeopardise the investigation. Here is the interesting fact, the suspect was someone called Tahir Hussain (alias Anup) and now you can guess why they did not release this name, well it goes against the narrative. 

slowly, the outrage died down. the congress and left, tried to milk it as much as possible meanwhile. people who were making voices, majoritaly leftists stopped it once they learnt that this may not be related to BJP/Sangh at all and there could be some reason. 

in between they also arrested another journo ravi belagere and found out that this guy was behind the murder of another journalist. some guy, you wouldn't have heard of him cos no one cares, not even left, cos it doesn't help them.

so basically, earlier people wanted this case to be against BJP, Modi and tried to milk it as possible. When they failed they kept mum. Chutiya congress govt, which is responsible for this, still blames Modi.

**Rajasthan Bypolls: Modi, Shah to campaign for BJP, no Rahul in Congress list** 

 ______ 
The BJP seems to be taking no chances with the three by-polls in Rajasthan
with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name finding place among the list of 40
star campaigners that was release by the party on Thursday.

Conspicuous by their absence in the list released by party national president
Amit Shah, are Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan Om Mathur and Union minister
Rajyavardhan Rathore.

Mathur, a former party president, considered close to the Prime Minister and
to Shah, and a known detractor of chief minister Vasundhara Raje while
Rathore, a Rajput leader, is the only Union minister from Rajasthan who has
been dropped from the list.

The other minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Arjum Ram Meghwal, PP Chaudhary
and CR Chaudhary have been included in the list.

There has been a lot of speculation over the past four years about Raje being
asked to step down. But the party’s central leadership seems to have given an
indication that Raje alone is the face of the BJP in Rajasthan.

The Congress list of 40 star campaigners does not feature party president
Rahul Gandhi’s name.

Along with prominent leaders such as state party president Sachin Pilot,
former chief minister Ashok Gehlot and former party president CP Joshi, there
are seven former central ministers and six former state ministers in the list
of campaigners.

By-polls to the Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha seats and Mandalgarh assembly seat
will be held on January 29.

Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone for a refinery in Barmer’s
Pachpadra on January 16.

Modi, however, might give the by-poll campaign a miss, said party sources.
State BJP president Ashok Parnami said Modi is the party’s star campaigner but
generally prime minister’s do not campaign in by-elections.

The BJP has also included party office bearers including Amit Shah and Union
ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari and Piyush Goel on the list.

The BJP has roped in four Rajputs leaders–Union ministers Rajnath Singh and
Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and ministers of state Rajendra Rathore and
Pushpendra Singh to woo the Rajputs who have been loyal BJP voters but are
miffed with the government this time over the encounter of Anandpal Singh and
the film Padmavati.

Rajputs have significant presence in the Mandalagrh assembly segment and the
Ajmer Lok Sabha seat.

The Congress has four Rajput leaders and ten Jat leaders on its list. Jats
have a significant presence in Ajmer and a fairly strong presence in Alwar.
The BJP is making do with only three Jat leaders.

The BJP is also roping in Raje’s daughter-in-law, Niharika along with Kalulal
Gurjar, Hemsingh Bhadana and Prahlad Gunjal to woo the Gurjars who have a
strong presence in some constituencies in Ajmer. Given that Gurjars are likely
to go with state Congress president Sachin Pilot, the BJP is taking no
chances.

**Explain delay in transferring RTI applications: CIC R K Mathur to PMO** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| New Delhi |

Published: January 12, 2018 5:46 pm

Chief Information Commissioner R K Mathur has directed the Prime Minister’s
Office to explain the delay in transferring RTI applications to departments
concerned matters relating to the appointment of information commissioners,
proposed RTI rules, among others.

The orders came on petitions of Commodore Lokesh Batra (retd), who had sought
to know the details of the file notings related to the appointment of
information commissioners, proposed RTI rules, 2017 and a travel bill of the
prime minister through his four RTI applications.

According to the Right to Information Act, when an application is made to a
public authority requesting for an information — which is held by another
public authority or the subject matter of which is more closely connected with
the functions of another public authority, the application is transferred.

“Provided that the transfer of an application pursuant to this subsection
shall be made as soon as practicable but in no case later than five days from
the date of receipt of the application,” Section 6(3) of the RTI Act states.
Batra said that he requested for the information pertaining only to the PMO’s
records.

During the hearing, Batra stated he has experienced that prolonged delays in
providing information by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO), PMO,
has become a routine matter. “They are doing this persistently, even after
cautionary directions in his earlier cases. The appellant stated that the
respondent has caused wrong,” Mathur noted in his order citing the submissions
of Batra.

The CPIO of the PMO told the commission that the delay in providing the
information and inspection was not malafide. “The respondent (the PMO) is
directed to give reasons in writing for not transferring the RTI application
as per the RTI Act, within 30 days from the date of receipt of this order,”
Mathur said in each of his four orders.

1. Two days back, CJI Dipak Misra ordered a special investigation team (SIT) to reopen 1984 Sikh riots cases and investigate 186 cases related to it.



2. Last month, CJI Dipak Misra slammed Kapil Sibal when he asked to postpone the judgement of Ram Janmbhumi case after July 2019.



3. Justice Dipak Misra is leading the bench which will pass judgement on Rama-janmabhumi case.



4. The judges collegium, everyone knows is a part of the ""ecosystem"" created over the last 7 decades and has always thwarted efforts to let ""outsiders""come in the circle. It was this collegium which Modi Government wanted to dismantle through NJAC and wanted that people's representatives should have a say in Judges appointment. The entire Judiciary ably supported by Congress derailed the entire activity and refused to comply.



5. Well, the campaign against Dipak Misra, maligning the CJI (a constitutional post) baselessly and asking his impeachment a day after he ordered reopening of Sikh riots case and is set to pass judgement on Rama-janmabhumi case shows the power of ecosystem.



As retired SC Judge RS Sodhi said, ""These four judges have formed a union. There are 23 other judges as well. This trade unionism to malign the office of CJI is immature and uncalled for. These 4 judges have no right to sit in the highest court and must be impeached."" I agree with Justice Sodhi.

**On India Visit, A Roadshow In Gujarat With ""Friend Modi"" For Israel PM** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will arrive in India on a six-day visit on
Sunday

**NEW DELHI: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have another road show from the airport in
Ahmedabad next week, this one with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
his side in an open-top Gypsy decorated with flowers for the nine-km ride to
Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati ashram. Mr Netanyahu is going to spend a day in PM
Modi's home state on January 17 during his six-day India visit that will also
see him travelling to Mumbai to invite Bollywood to shoot their films in
Israel.

PM Modi's office had come up with the idea of joint road show with Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who was in Gujarat last September for a function to
formally start work on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project. They had
spent time at the Sabarmati riverfront with PM Modi playing the guide and
showing Shinzo Abe and his wife around.

It was considered to be a huge success to symbolise the deepening ties between
the two countries. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said Mr Netanyahu was
going to get a grand welcome too. From the ashram, the two prime ministers
would go to 'iCreate', an autonomous centre that mentors budding entrepreneurs
and later, the Sabarkantha-based centre of excellence for agriculture.

The visit begins in New Delhi where Mr Netanyahu will have dinner with PM Modi
and meet Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj. The following day he will call on
President Ram Nath Kovind then have more talks with PM Modi. On Tuesday, Mr
Netanyahu will visit the Taj Mahal and then attend the annual ""Raisina
Dialogue"" geo-political conference, news agency AFP reported.

PM Modi had received a rousing welcome during his visit to the Jewish state in
July last year when PM Netanyahu, who referred to the Indian leader as his
'dear friend', had received him at the airport and spent the next three days
by his side. The PM Modi-Netanyahu bromance was seen to be carefully
choreographed, complete with shots of bear hugs and them walking barefoot
together through the Mediterranean surf.

PM Netanyahu's visit - he will be accompanied by 130-strong business
delegation - is seen to be an effort to build on the July decision taken last
year to elevate ties to a ""strategic partnership"" and deepen trade ties
between the two countries. Israel needs large markets for its export-driven
economy and has been working towards deepening ties with India and China.

Also in PM Netanyahu's delegation will be the head of the Rafael Advanced
Defence Systems that lost out on $500-million deal to purchase Spike anti-tank
guided missiles.

The state-run firm had spoken about its disappointment at New Delhi cancelling
the contract but there was recognition that this contract was only a small
part of the total defence cooperation budget. Israel already is a major
weapons supplier to India, selling it an average of $1 billion of military
equipment each year. Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. won nearly $2 billion in
contracts from India last year alone.

__ Comments

Israel and India will announce deals and joint investments in areas ranging
from defence to renewable energy, Gilad Cohen, deputy director-general in
charge of Asia at Israel's Foreign Ministry, said in a briefing Wednesday,
according to news agency AFP.

One of Mr Netanyahu's stops on the trip, the first by an Israeli premier since
Ariel Sharon in 2003, will be in Mumbai where he will meet on January 18 with
stars and executives of India's mammoth film industry. Bollywood ""mega-celebs
wield tremendous influence around the world,"" Mr Cohen said.

**I don’t believe in soft or hard Hindutva. Hindutva is Hindutva: Siddaramaiah** 

 ______ 
Chief minister Siddaramaiah and the Congress party seem confident of retaining
power, a feat not achieved in many decades in Karnataka. Photo: Hemant
Mishra/Mint

**Udupi: **In the final leg of his month-long tour of Karnataka, chief minister Siddaramaiah, 69, is a happy man. Riding on the back of populist schemes like Anna Bhagya (free rice), Ksheera Bhagya (free milk for students) and programmes focusing on backward classes and minorities (his core support group), Siddaramaiah and the Congress seem confident of retaining power, a feat not achieved in many decades in Karnataka. Assembly elections to the state are scheduled later this year.

In an interview with _Mint_, Siddaramaiah talks about the upcoming assembly
elections in the state and how he is countering the Hindutva debate, among
other issues. Edited excerpts:

**How was the response to your tour?**

This is the 25th day of the Yatra that began on 13 December. I will be in
Chamarajanagara on Thursday and then Mysuru, and then conclude in Mandya on 12
January. The response of the people has exceeded our expectations. The reason
is simply that there is no anti-incumbency against our government, people are
happy with our programmes as over 90% of them have benefitted from them.

**You have successfully cornered the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka on various issues, including the Kannada pride debate. How polarised is this election going to be?**

This is not management. We are taking the right decisions at the right time.
We have clarity on all issues, hence I take the right decisions. Be it
language, social justice or secularism, I have no confusion anywhere. The BJP
is confused because they have no definite ideology. They will say anything to
come to power. They will be caught, if not today, then tomorrow.

They (BJP) are expecting polarisation and communalism to pay off. But this is
not possible in Karnataka.

**Do you need star campaigners like those being used by the BJP? Does Siddaramaiah need outside support or has he become bigger than the party?**

Ours is a national party. I am campaigning as chief minister and presenting
our government’s achievements before the people. Our national president, Rahul
Gandhi, will also campaign. He campaigned more than local leaders in Gujarat.
Nobody is above the party. I am telling people the ideology of the party. I am
a little aggressive since the BJP is attempting to polarise, making false
promises and I am countering it.

**In Gujarat it was Rahul Gandhi versus Modi. Will it be Siddaramaiah versus Modi in Karnataka?**

It is not Modi versus Siddaramaiah, it is Congress party versus the BJP. This
is an ideological fight between Congress ideology and BJP—that is if they have
any ideology. According to me, this time around, because they (BJP) are making
Hindutva a major issue, in the upcoming election, it would be communalism
versus secularism.

**You have also started using the Hindutva term? What role does caste play?**

BJP has not taken a contract of Hindutva, they are misguiding people. No other
party has as many Hindus as the Congress. Are there no Hindus in our party? Am
I not a Hindu? But humanity is important. Spreading hatred in the name of
religion and inciting Hindus is not allowed in the Constitution. I do not
believe in soft or hard Hindutva. Hindutva is Hindutva.

Secularism includes people of all religions and castes. It is not confined to
particular religion or castes. In a pluralistic society, our culture has to be
similar.

**Why is Dakshina Kannada burning in communal rage?**

It is not on the rise. Bantwal and South Canara (Dakshina Kannada) witnessed
it but not Udupi. It is being raked up in north Canara (Uttara Kannada) now.
Despite all this, we won seven out of eight constituencies in South Canara.
This time we will win all eight. Four of our MLAs are minorities—two Muslims,
one Christian and one Jain. Can the BJP win like this? That is secularism,
social justice.

**Karnataka helped revive the Congress party (at the centre) in the ’70s. Will the state lead the charge again after 2018? Will Rahul Gandhi contest a seat from here in 2019?**

The Congress party may have lost but winning and losing is common. The party
lost in 1977 as well but it was revived because Congress is the only party
that has a base in the entire country—across states—northern and southern.
Congress has a base in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha,
West Bengal—the party is everywhere. Congress will always bounce back and it
will do so in the next election. There is no such proposal for Rahul Gandhi to
contest in Karnataka.

**Your government has been criticised for the crumbling infrastructure in Bengaluru. **

The BJP ruled for five years but what infrastructure did they develop? What
did H.D. Kumaraswamy do in 20 months when they were in alliance? They merged
110 villages and municipalities and villages to make way for Greater
Bengaluru—their biggest achievement. We (Congress) are allocating budget for
infrastructure development. In the next five years, Bengaluru will wear a
different look as far as infrastructure is concerned. Metro (rail) will be
completed.

**How has Siddaramaiah evolved since 2006 (when he joined the Congress)?**

In terms of ideology, there is no difference. Neither in commitments.
Commitments remain the same. Then I was in the opposition and now, I have been
given the opportunity to be in power and administer. People with self-respect
come across as arrogant to fascist forces.

Youth, who should be the most important participants in the Indian democracy,
are mostly absent from the daily discourse on democracy. (Representational

January 12 was the National Youth Day, celebrated on the occasion of the great
youth icon Swami Vivekananda’s birthday. Around this day, the nation must take
stock of the status of the youth of the country, on whom depends the future of
our democracy. January 1, 2018, marked a very important day for Indian
democracy. On this day, people born in the 21st century became eligible to
vote. The prime minister had this very thought in mind when, in the last
session of ‘Mann ki Baat’ for 2017, he focused on and encouraged the youth to
participate in huge numbers in the voting process.

He urged all youths turning 18 by January 1 to enrol as voters so that they
can be active participants in the Indian democracy in the following year and
the years to come, telling them that their votes would be the bedrock of a New
India. He also suggested holding a mock parliament, comprising youths selected
from every district, to come together to deliberate on the various issues the
country faces today. Specifically addressing youths aged 18-25, the prime
minister, calling them the “New India Youth”, urged them to participate in the
Indian democracy and make it corruption and casteism free.

Over the years, the PM has time and again reiterated the role that the youth
have to play in shaping a new and better India. That makes PM Modi one of the
few politicians who has understood the importance of youth power. The role of
the youth in shaping the course of any democracy is undeniable. More than 50
per cent of India’s population is below the age of 25, and more than 65 per
cent below 35. Given that democracy is the will of the majority, and the
majority of India’s population — nearly 400 million voters — is the youth, it
is essential to look at the way this majority can be harnessed to participate
in democracy and contribute towards the development of the country. One of the
most important ways is by exercising their right to vote.

The right to vote is not just a right enjoyed by every individual over the age
of 18, it is also a responsibility to make an informed and responsible choice
and to bring to power the most well-suited candidate. For a long time, there
has been a trend to vote for people who give the maximum amount of freebies in
return. Instead of following this path, the youth must make a conscious
decision to vote on the basis of the agenda of the candidates and their past
work.

It is only when the youth become aware of the problems that the country is
facing and choose the candidate who is most likely to bring about a change,
that the right representatives will come to power and India’s future will be
in safe hands. The task is not a long and tedious one. All it requires is a
bit of effort to look at all the contesting candidates, their histories and
their agendas and vote for the one that they deem the most fit to govern the
country. Several websites are making this task easier by simplifying the
analysis of the comparative performance of the competing candidates.

In my book,_ An Undocumented Wonder: The Making of the Great Indian Election
(2014)_, I had pointed out that the youth, who should be the most important
participants in the Indian democracy, are mostly absent from the daily
discourse on democracy. While they are visible at protest marches, in cricket
grounds, at music concerts, cultural events, and can be seen blocking roads,
stopping trains, throwing stones, burning tyres and raving and ranting against
corruption and bad governance, when the time comes to actually participate in
the decision-making process and change the system and its culture by electing
the right leaders, most of them disappear.

When I started my tenure as the chief election commissioner, I was distressed
to find out that the voter enrolment ratio amongst the 18-20-year-olds was as
low as 12 per cent. We in the Election Commission decided to make this issue
our top priority. Through a programme called Youth Unite for Voter Awareness
(YUVA), we argued that the best way to convert a country’s demographic
dividend into democratic dividend is through the mass participation of youth
in elections. National Voters Day (NVD), celebrated on January 25, 2011, was
launched as an annual event dedicated to youth.

This seeks to create an enlightened movement of voters who see voting as an
opportunity to bring about change, who are aware of their role and are neutral
with respect to caste, religion, community or other identity differences,
those who have their own views about a party and its performance and change
their preference from election to election if needed. The NVD not only
encourages the youth to enrol in huge numbers and vote without fail but also
seeks to involve them in increasing awareness amongst other voters.

Democracy cannot survive without both citizens’ participation and politicians’
accountability. Since the politicians would do nothing to inform the youth
about the socio-economic problems facing the nation today and only exploit
them, it is the responsibility of civil society organisations and the media to
educate young people about the issues involved and their high stakes in the
fruits of development.

It is important to remember that instead of always pontificating to the youth
about their role and responsibilities, political leaders should remind
themselves of their own role to fulfil the needs and aspirations of the youth,
particularly with respect to jobs. If their expectations are not met, a
backlash is unavoidable. Once the youth become restive, chaos cannot be far
behind.

**Congress questions PM Modi for sending principal secretary to CJI Dipak Misra** 

 ______ 
The Congress on Saturday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi why he sent his
principal secretary Nripendra Misra to Chief Justice Dipak Misra’s residence
in New Delhi a day after four senior judges told the media that all was not
well with the Supreme Court.

TV visuals showed Nripendra driving to the CJI’s official residence in New
Delhi. However, the gates were not opened and after waiting for a while, the
principal secretary to the prime minister was seen driving back.

“As PM’s Principal Secretary, Nripendra Misra visits CJI’s residence at 5,
Krishna Menon Marg; PM must answer the reason for sending this special
messenger to Chief Justice of India,” tweeted Congress spokesperson Randeep
Singh Surjewala.

The development came a day after Justice J Chelameswar along with three other
sitting senior Supreme Court judges took on Justice Misra over the allocation
of benches, among other issues.

On Friday, in an unprecedented move, the four seniormost judges in the Supreme
Court burst out in the open and accused the Chief Justice of not strictly
adhering to the rules in assigning cases to appropriate benches, which they
said could create “doubts” about the integrity of the top court.

Speaking to the media at the residence of Justice Chelameswar, the judges said
the Supreme Court administration was “not in order” and released an undated
letter they wrote to Justice Misra in which they conceded that the CJI was the
“master of the roster” but this was “not a recognition of any superior
authority, legal or factual, of the Chief Justice over his colleagues”.

The four judges were Justices Ranjan Gogoi, Kurian Joseph and Madan B Lokur,
besides Justice Chelameswar.

122,"India is projected to be the world’s fastest-growing large economy for the rest of the decade, according to projections from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It will also soon be the world’s largest country by population, if it isn’t already. Put together, rapid economic and population growth will soon make India the world’s fifth largest economy overall. In the 2020s it will likely overtake Germany to become the fourth largest, trailing only the United States, China and Japan. Measured in purchasing power parity terms, it’s already number three.

That’s great news for the big business groups of Delhi and Mumbai and their billionaire owners: large and growing markets create the perfect conditions for expanding profitability. It also bodes well for foreign investment. India is one of only two developing countries to score in the top 10 in A.T. Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index (the other is China), and the only country with a GDP per capital of less than $5,000 to be ranked at all. According to Kearney, India is perceived as “chaotic” but “competitive.”

Which one best describes India probably depends on what part of India you’re describing. Home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population, India is a study in contrasts. Its 36 states and union territories range from giant Uttar Pradesh with more than 200 million people to tiny island territories and former Portuguese enclaves with fewer than half a million. But unfortunately for India, some of its largest states are also its poorest. Uttar Pradesh and neighboring Bihar have a combined population roughly equal to that of the U.S., but a combined GDP less than that of Michigan.

**India’s 36 states and union territories by net state domestic product**

https://blogs-images.forbes.com/salvatorebabones/files/2018/01/India-StateNSDP.jpg?width=960

All of India is poor. The GDP per capita of Delhi, the National Capital Territory with a population of 20-25 million, is roughly equal to that of Indonesia at around $4,000. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India’s poorest states, are on a par with sub-Saharan Africa (less than $1,000). And geographical disparities matter much more in India than in other large countries. In the United States, the richest state (Massachusetts) has roughly twice the GDP of the poorest (Mississippi). In China the ratio is 4-1 between Beijing and Gansu. In India, Delhi’s GDP per capita is eight times that of Bihar.

In southern India, Bangalore is famous as India’s technology capital, home to companies like Flipkart, Infosys and Wipro, as well as the Indian Institute of Science, India’s top-ranked university. Yet the state of which Bangalore is the capital,  Karnataka, has a GDP per capita of around $2,400, roughly the same as Papua New Guinea. Tech entrepreneurs drive to work past open sewers and shantytowns. The real Silicon Valley in California has similar problems with inequality, but the scale of inequality in Bangalore is something completely different.

If India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is serious about his election slogan Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (Together with All, Progress for All), then reducing India’s regional disparities should be high on his agenda. Modi’s GST reform was an indispensable measure to reduce internal trade barriers, and his highway construction program is a good start toward knitting the country together. But India will need a lot more regional growth and much more generous fiscal transfers to its poorer states to overcome its extreme regional disparities.

India as a whole won’t reach middle-income status until it unites its poorer states into the same Incredible India economy as the rest of the country. That’s a challenge beyond the remit of any one government. But Modi and his BJP government swept to power in 2014 on the votes of India’s poorest states, of the people most excluded from India’s economic growth. If Modi wants to retain his majority in the next parliamentary elections, he would do well to focus on reducing the regional disparities that played such a key role in bringing him to office in the first place.",2018-01-14 09:41:23

The one thing that has changed is that they are all forced now to have an
Aadhaar card, and if they want work under the MNREGA, they need to upload
their details to get a job card (File)

In the village last week in which I met a man who had an Aadhaar card but
could not use it because manual labour had erased the lines on his fingertips,
nobody was literate. There is no road to the village, electricity is erratic
and clean water impossible. Village water is so awful that villagers regularly
get sick, but to get to the nearest hospital they have to walk 2 km to the
highway where they take a bus to the nearest town.

To find work they catch the same bus to a stone mine 50 km away, where they
earn Rs 300 a day, of which they spend Rs 60 on transport. The rest on somehow
staying alive. It has always been this way, but when the BJP government came
to power and the Prime Minister promised ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ they hoped
that things would change.

The one thing that has changed is that they are all forced now to have an
Aadhaar card, and if they want work under the MNREGA, they need to upload
their details to get a job card. Nobody in the village has a cellphone so they
need to go to the nearest town to do this as well.

A village elder said, “We still believe Modiji is a good man and that he wants
to do something for us, but please tell him we cannot spend Rs 100 a day on
photos and going online.” If anyone needs proof that it is India’s poorest
citizens who are most hurt by Aadhaar, let them travel to a village like the
one I went to and do a reality check.

At this point I need to remind you that I have been a conscientious objector
to the Aadhaar card. I did not get one for as long as I could because I
thought it was a dangerously irresponsible idea, but in the end was forced to
get one because it is impossible to do anything in India now without this
wretched card.

When banks start demanding one and when even couriers bringing books from
Amazon refused to hand them over without it, I was forced to go to a little
hole in the wall in my village and get photographed and fingerprinted. By then
the long queues had gone.

Last week when the privacy issue made headlines, Nandan Nilekani, the man
responsible for this unique identity idea, said there was a malicious campaign
against Aadhaar. Not true, Nandan. People like me have objected to it from day
one because we understand the ways and wiles of Indian officialdom better than
you do.

Literate Indians learn to deal with them by oiling palms and slipping through
loopholes, but if you are illiterate and poor and living in rural India,
things like Aadhaar end up becoming just another way for some rural official
to make your very hard life even harder.

In the villages I visited last week, I asked if there was a place where they
could take their grievances and find remedies. They said, “Yes. We can go to
the collector, but to get there we have to spend Rs 500 on transport. We don’t
have that kind of money to spend.”

Mr Nilekani also said that Aadhaar was here to stay. Yes it is now, and it’s
bad luck that Indian taxpayers have spent billions of rupees on adding yet
another card to the many we already have, but something needs to be done to
stop this card from becoming a monster.

It is bad enough, as the Supreme Court has already pointed out, that it has
begun to seem as if we stop being Indians if we lose our cards. But, can we at
least stop making it compulsory to do almost everything, from opening a bank
account to getting public services that is the fundamental duty of our
worthless officials to provide.

It is unfortunate that protests against Aadhaar have come mostly from educated
Indians in towns and cities who have raised issues of privacy and identity
theft. These voices are heard louder only because those who are really
suffering under the weight of Aadhaar are voiceless.

It is ironic that it is those who really need government subsidies to survive
the horrors of living below the Indian poverty line now suffer even more
because of a card that was supposed to help them. If this information has not
reached the Prime Minister’s office it is because his MPs and MLAs rarely
visit villages to which there are no roads.

In the villages that I visited last week, the elected representatives of these
desperately poor people have not been seen since they last came to ask for
their votes in 2014. They gave them happily because they liked what Narendra
Modi was saying about ‘parivartan’.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart

Benjamin Netanyahu

will today attend a solemn ceremony at the Teen Murti Memorial to mark the
formal renaming of

Teen Murti Chowk

as

Teen Murti Haifa Chowk

.

The two leaders will also lay a wreath and sign the visitor's book at the
memorial, official sources said.

Netanyahu is arriving in India on a six-day visit today.

The three bronze statues at Teen Murti represent the Hyderabad, Jodhpur and
Mysore Lancers who were part of the

15 Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade

.

The brigade carried out the victorious assault on the fortified city of Haifa
on September 23, 1918, during World War I.

There are various accounts of this battle - all narrate the valour with which
the lancers undertook the assault on the garrisoned city protected by a joint
force of Ottomans, Germany and Austria-Hungary. The liberation of Haifa
cleared a supply route for the Allies to the city through the sea.

Forty-four Indian soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice during the liberation
of the city in World War I.

Till date, the 61 Cavalry celebrates September 23 as its Raising Day or ""Haifa
Day.""

**Only those Muslims will stay in India who assimilate into Hindu culture, says BJP** 

 ______ 
Taking a jibe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the BJP MLA said, “There are
two sets of values in Rahul Gandhi — one is Italian, while the other one is
Indian…He can never become the torchbearer of the Indian thought.” (PTI)

In a controversial remark, a BJP MLA from this district has said that once
India becomes a “Hindu rashtra”, only those Muslims will stay in the country
who assimilate into the Hindu culture. “There are a very few Muslims who are
patriotic. Once India becomes a Hindu rashtra (Hindu nation), Muslims who
assimilate into our culture will stay in India. Those who will not are free to
take asylum in any other country,” Bairia MLA Surendra Singh told reporters
here last night. He also claimed that by 2024, India would become a Hindu
nation. Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an “avatar purush”
(reincarnation of a deity), Singh said, “As the RSS completes 100 years in
2025, by 2024, India will become a Hindu rashtra. By the grace of god, India
is going to be a global superpower thanks to the leadership of Modi and Uttar
Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Not only will India become a ‘vishwa
guru’, it will also become a Hindu rashtra by 2024.”

Taking a jibe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the BJP MLA said, “There are
two sets of values in Rahul Gandhi — one is Italian, while the other one is
Indian…He can never become the torchbearer of the Indian thought.” He said the
Gandhi scion could coin any slogan to become the prime minister of the
country, but he lacked the strength and values to make India strong. “His
(Rahul Gandhi’s) is a mix of Indian and Italian culture,” Singh said and
claimed that the Congress chief was not aware of what India and Indianness
were all about.

**India's Tiny Jewish Community Sees Hope In Benjamin Netanyahu's Visit** 

 ______ 
**Mumbai: **

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes an emotional visit this week
to a Jewish centre targeted in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in a trip that India's
tiny and shrinking Jewish community hopes will boost its profile.

Netanyahu will talk trade in New Delhi and marvel at the Taj Mahal before
rounding off his visit in Mumbai, where the majority of India's estimated
4,500 Jews live.

There he will accompany 11-year-old Moshe Holtzberg as the boy returns for the
first time to the house where his parents were killed in the 26/11 terror
attacks that left 166 people dead.

At Mumbai's Magen David synagogue, worshippers are excited about the first
visit to India by an Israeli leader in almost 15 years.

""It's very good news for us. We're very lucky to get to see the prime minister
over here,"" Joel Gershon Awaskar told AFP after concluding his morning
prayers.

Netanyahu will be only the second Israeli PM to visit India and the first
since Ariel Sharon in 2003. It comes six months after Prime Minister Narendra
Modi toured Israel.

Chabad Mumbai Director Rabbi Israel Kozlovsky speaks about the forthcoming
memorial for the victims of the 26/11 terror attack as his wife and co-
director Chaya Kozlovsky looks on at their home in Mumbai. (AFP)

For Jonathan Solomon, chairman of the Indian Jewish Federation, the reciprocal
visits and warm ties between the two countries are of the ""utmost importance""
to Jews in India.

""The closer the co-operation, the closer the Jewish community in India feels
to Israel. So we feel recognised and we feel secure,"" he told AFP.

It is not just recognition from abroad that many Indian Jews crave.

Although historians believe Jews first arrived in India 2,000 years ago, their
descendents today say they are virtually unknown in a country where they are
hugely outnumbered by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and
Zoroastrians.

Nor are Jews officially recognised as a minority community by the government.

**Unknown**

India is in fact home to several distinct Jewish groups.

These include Bene Israelis, who have the longest history in India, and
Baghdadi Jews, who fled persecution in the Middle East in the 18th and 19th
centuries.

Although there are no official figures, academics say India's Jewish
population peaked at around 20,000 in the mid 1940s.

Numbers have dwindled rapidly because of emigration since the creation of
Israel in 1948.

""Many people here don't know about the Jewish community, about our customs and
festivals,"" said Awaskar, who hopes Netanyahu's visit will help increase
awareness amongst Indians about the Jewish faith.

""It will be good for us, we'll become well known,"" he added, a black-and-white
checked, round cloth ""kippah"" resting on the top of his head.

Magen David, light blue in colour and situated in Mumbai's historic Byculla
district, is one of eight synagogues in India's financial capital and
surrounding suburbs.

Every morning some 15 men -- a few swaying back and forth -- recite prayers
there, in a space which could easily hold hundreds.

Afterwards they sit down for a breakfast consisting of bread, eggs and cheese,
washed down with a cup of tea.

More prayers are read and then bananas and slices of apple are served.

""This whole area used to be Jewish,"" recalls Ellis Jacob David, an official at
the synagogue. ""But many migrated to Israel, UK, Canada, Australia and the
USA.""

**'Emotional'**

India's Jewish community hasn't experienced the discrimination seen in other
countries, a fact that Jewish historian Leora Pezarkar partly attributes to
its adoption of Indian customs, dress and language.

""The community has mixed really well with the local population while not
deviating from who they are as Jews,"" she told AFP.

David, whose parents fled persecution in Iraq to come to India 125 years ago,
says he has never experienced or heard of anyone being a victim of anti-
semitism in India.

""There was just one attack and that took place from outside the country, not
internal, at all,"" he told AFP, referring to November 2008.

Members of the Indian Jewish community pray before breakfast following a
morning prayer service at the Magen David Synagogue in Mumbai. (AFP)

Six people were killed at Chabad House, a Jewish centre in south Mumbai, when
Pakistani terrorists carried out co-ordinated attacks across the city.

Moshe Holtzberg was just two years old when his parents, who ran the centre,
were gunned down. He was saved by his nanny who managed to escape and now
lives in Israel.

On Thursday, Moshe, along with Netanyahu, will visit his former home where a
memorial to the victims is to be unveiled.

""His visit is going to be very emotional for us. This is the place where he
got his last hug from his father and mother,"" Israel Kozlovsky, the centre's
rabbi, told AFP.

Netanyahu will also travel to PM Modi's home state of Gujarat and host a party
for Bollywood producers where he will trumpet Israel as a filming location.

Jewish leaders hope the visit will help persuade the Indian government to
officially recognise them as a minority community, meaning they would be
included in the census.

__ Comments

In 2016, Maharashtra state granted Jews minority status, making it easier to
register marriages and acquire funding for institutions, but the central
government is yet to follow suit.

""Although it is just a symbolic recognition it is important for the
community,"" said Solomon.

If I was INC president, I would offer them protection and lifelong stay in 10 Janpath road, just to tell the world the complete truth - which as I understand from r/india is that he is being forced to lie due to fear from Shah.

If he is lying in fear, then with protection he can give the complete truth - and then with the SC revolt recently - we can easily shoot for forming a jury of the remaining 30 judges of SC, and getting them to do an indepth review of the Loya case. 

Worst case scenario, nothing happens. 

Best case scenario, Modi/Shah go to jail for lifetime. Without them, BJP crumbles like cards. Modi/Shah killed 2nd rung BJP leaders' powers..so BJP will take another 10-15 years to come to power.

You need to first answer the below questions.


As the BJP is an anti Muslim party also against the Constitution as the desire to change it and make India a huge Hindu rashtra has been enunciated multiple times by it's leaders going against their constitutional oath to protect it ?

Since it has been established that Modi is by and large incompetent ,The development plank has been jettisoned in Karnataka in favour of screaming Hinduism is in danger all over the place . Is this going to be the new BJP pollplank?. If so why is BJP think it  right to fracture national identity to build it's votebanks with impunity but it does not like other parties to build identities for dispossessed and downtrodden people ?

A BJP legislator from Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh has landed himself in
hot water after stating that once India becomes a “Hindu rashtra”, only those
Muslims will stay in the country who assimilate into the Hindu culture.

“There are a very few Muslims who are patriotic. Once India becomes a Hindu
rashtra (Hindu nation), Muslims who assimilate into our culture will stay in

Bairia MLA Surendra Singh told reporters last night.

“As the RSS completes 100 years in 2025, by 2024, India will become a Hindu

to the leadership of Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
Not only will India become a ‘vishwa guru’, it will also become a Hindu
rashtra by 2024.”

The BJP MLA also took a dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi and said the
Gandhi scion could never become the torchbearer of the Indian thought. “There
are two sets of values in Rahul Gandhi — one is Italian, while the other one
is Indian…He can never become the torchbearer of the Indian thought.”

Singh also said the Congress president lacked the strength and values to make

**India, Israel likely to sign 8 MoUs today** 

 ______ 
BENGALURU: While

India

PMO welcomed Israel Prime Minister

Benjamin Netanyahu

yesterday for a six-day visit (14th-19th January), i t is expected that 8 MoUs
will be signed today. The business delegation which consists of 100 companies,
20 startups and 30 government officials from the economic arena, aim to
collaborate with Indian companies.

Talking to ET, a top official executive said that MoUs with IT department of
Andhra Pradesh, IT major

Tech Mahindra

, Mukesh Ambani-led

Reliance Industries

, Ashok Leyland among others will be signed today.

The Israel Electric Corporation will render services and capacities to the
State of Andhra Pradesh in the field of critical infrastructure. Further, it
will also endeavor to facilitate and function as an accelerator for

cyber security

startups in the State of Andhra Pradesh.

On the other hand, Israel-based big data and smart city tech startup mPrest is
signing MoU with Reliance Industries. Also, Israel which is known for its
cyber-security infrastructure will be collaborating with Tech Mahindra on that
front.

Overall, Israel will be majorly looking at rendering technological
capabilities to India but not directly invest. ""There are so many markets that
are right now blocked for Israel companies but if we join hands with Indian
manufacturers and share knowledge and technology, through a joint
collaboration we can reach out to global markets,"" he added.

Dana Nahari, Head of Economic and Trade Mission, Israel Consulate General in
Mumbai said that post Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

's visit to Israel, they received many requests from Indian companies and
therefore organized these meetings as many Israeli companies are keen to
understand the Indian market.

Along with these collaborations, India and Israel government is together also
launching an R&amp;amp;D fund of $40million which will support businesses from
both the countries. ""Each company will bear 25% of the R&amp;amp;D cost while the
governments together will sponsor 50% of the cost,"" explained the executive.

Over the last two years, a number of delegations from India were organized
which showcased Israel's capabilities and built cross-collaborations. Further
Israel is now also looking to join hands with bodies like ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI
and NASSCOM to nurture business in both the countries.

Nasscom Product Council is also signing MoU with Israel-based startup
accelerator MassChallenge. The joint campaign will identify and attract
relevant high potential startups to apply and be part of the 2018
MassChallenge. Leveraging the NASSCOM network, MassChallenge will support and
grow its value proposition and bring Indian startups to the MassChallenge
accelerator in Israel, according to sources.

Last year, Nasscom Product Council and IT consulting major Accenture also
visited Israel to form a pact with Israel Innovation Authority, and start an
education initiative with

Tel Aviv University

, identify one accelerator partner and also partner with OurCrowd and
Jerusalem Venture Partners.

Modi had visited the Jewish state in July last year, becoming the first Indian
premier to do so. Bilateral trade with Israel clocked $5.04 billion in
2016-17, rising 2.3 percent.

**PM Modi invites Israel to invest in defence, Netanyahu calls him ‘revolutionary’**

By:

Express Web Desk

counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu. (Express Photo by Renuka Puri)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi held delegation-level talks with his Israeli
counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday and invited Israel firms to take
advantage of the liberalised FDI regime in the defence sector to make in
India. Netanyahu, who is on a six-day tour to India, called Modi a
“revolutionary” leader as the two nations inked nine pacts to boost
cooperation in key areas, including cybersecurity and energy.

“In defence, I have invited Israeli companies to take advantage of the
liberalised FDI regime to make more in India with our companies. Last year,
you (Netanyahu) had expressed an intent to cut down bureaucratic red tape. In
India, we are doing just that. Our discussions today were marked by
convergence to accelerate development and scale our partnership,” Modi said.

Presently, FDI in defence is allowed up to 49 per cent through the automatic
route, while government nod is required for 100 per cent foreign investment.
Recently, the government has allowed 100 per cent FDI in single-brand retail
in a bid to ease business.

Meanwhile, the bonhomie between the two leaders was on full show during the
joint address when Modi referred to the Israel PM by his nickname ‘Bibi’ and
Netanyahu addressed the Indian PM by his first name ‘Narendra’. It may be
recalled that during former US President Barack Obama’s visit to India in
January 2015, Modi had referred to him by his first name more than once during
a joint address, in what signalled a growing friendship between India and the
US.

**ALSO READ: Benjamin Netanyahu in India LIVE UPDATES: Israel-India sign 9 pacts in areas of oil and gas, cybersecurity**

“Last year in July, I carried the greetings and friendship of 1.25 billion
Indians during my momentous journey to Israel. In return, I was overwhelmed by
the generous affection and warmth of the Israeli people led by my friend
Bibi,” Modi said. Modi’s visit to Israel last year was the first by an Indian
sitting PM to the Jewish state.

Stressing that agriculture, science, and technology would be the focus of the
cooperation between the two countries, Modi said, “We will strengthen existing
pillars of cooperation in areas that touch the lives of our peoples. These are
agriculture, science and technology and security. We exchanged views on
scaling up the Centers of Excellence that have been a mainstay of agricultural
cooperation.”

On his part, Netanyahu praised India’s tolerance and democracy, saying Jews in
the country never witnessed antisemitism like in other nations. “Jews in India
have never witnessed antisemitism like in some other countries. This is a
tribute to India’s great civilization, tolerance, and democracy,” he said.

**RELATED REPORT: Israeli PM Netanyahu arrives; India, Israel seek to put UN vote behind them**

Lauding Modi for revolutionising India-Israel relations, Netanyahu, who is the
second Israeli PM to visit India after Ariel Sharon, said despite the doubts
and challenges, the nations were living proof that democracy worked. “Despite
the doubts and challenges, India and Israel are living proof that democracy
works and indicates something deeper — the intrinsic value of freedom. We are
proud we are seizing the future to make lives better around the world,”
Netanyahu said.

The 26/11 Mumbai attacks also found mention in Netanyahu’s address. “Indians
and Israelis remember too well the savagery of terrorist attacks. We fight
back, we never give in,” the Israeli PM said. About six Israelis were killed
during the attack by Lashkar-e-Toiba on Chabad House. Eleven-year-old Moshe
Holtzberg, whose parents were killed in the attack, will visit the Chabad
House next week.

Speaking on the shared past of the two countries, Netanyahu said, “Your visit
to Israel was groundbreaking as it was the first time an Indian leader visited
the country. You (PM Narendra Modi) are catapulting India into future and are
revolutionising India-Israel relations.” Modi’s historic visit to Israel was
remembered for more than diplomatic reasons and it was his camaraderie with
Netanyahu that caught everyone’s eye, including the leaders walking barefoot
on the beach hand in hand.

During Modi’s visit, Netanyahu had said ‘I’ for ‘I’ is India for Israel, and
‘I’ with ‘I’ is India with Israel. However, this time the Israel PM signed off
by saying, “My friend Narendra, if anytime you want to do a yoga class, it’s a
big stretch but I will be there, try me.”

process will be completed by the end of 2018, Junior Aviation Minister

Jayant Sinha

said in an interview Monday. Its regional arm, ground handling, and
engineering operations will also be sold separately in the same process.

A successful sale of Air India -- with $7.9 billion in debt, five subsidiaries
and a joint venture, and a combined workforce of 27,000 -- is crucial for
Modi, who wants to showcase his credentials as a reformist attempting to steer
the state away from running businesses. The airline, which is surviving on a
taxpayer-funded bailout, has strained government finances for decades, and
Finance Minister

Arun Jaitley

said last year that money spent on Air India could have been used for
education.

**Unlocking Growth**

""The aviation sector is a very fast growing sector, with really exciting
opportunities for all participants, so we felt all of this will unlock growth
and competitiveness of Air India group,"" Sinha said. ""We expect it to be a
very bright future for its employees.""

Sinha declined to name potential bidders but said management control will be
retained by local investors. The government altered foreign investment rules
last week, allowing foreign airlines to own as much as 49 percent of Air
India. Investors' interest will be sought by end of this month with details on
Air India's core and non-core debt and assets, he added.

The government will add most of the non-core debt owed by the carrier to its
own balance sheet, while borrowings linked to core operations will be retained
by the unit on offer, Sinha said. A so-called special purpose vehicle will
hold the unsustainable debt of the airline and the government is making ""every
effort"" to protect employees.

Air India has been unprofitable since its 2007 merger with state-owned
domestic operator Indian Airlines Ltd. The company made an operating profit of
about 1 billion rupees ($15.7 million) in the year through March 2016,
primarily due to a slump in oil prices. It still posted a net loss of 38.4
billion rupees, according to the government.

**$63 Billion Investment**

India, the world's fastest growing major aviation market, may not sustain the
current 15-20 percent growth in the long term, but will expand at about 12
percent annually. To handle the surge in passengers, the country will need
investments of as much as 4 trillion rupees to expand and build new airports
over the next decade-and-a-half, with the bulk of it coming from the private
sector.

Carriers in India, including market leader IndiGo, are set to order more than
1,000 planes as they look to tap an emerging middle class with disposable
income to fly for the first time, according to Sydney-based CAPA Centre for
Aviation. However, capacity constraints at the main airports in New Delhi and
Mumbai mean there are hardly any landing and parking slots available.

The government is in the process of implementing new airports in these two
cities and, in the short-term, improving infrastructure at nearby airports to
handle some of that growth.

""As of now, we have very significant expansion plans underway. We've looked at
the top 30 airports in the country,"" Sinha said. ""We now have a very clear
roadmap for the next 15-20 years as to what we have to do.""

**PM Modi Promises More Reforms, Invites Israeli Companies To Invest** 

 ______ 
PM Modi said his government is positioning India as a global manufacturing
hub.

**New Delhi: **

Promising more reforms to further improve the ease of doing business, Prime
Minister Narendra Modi today invited investments from Israeli companies saying
the country has a huge development agenda and offers vast opportunities.

Speaking at India-Israel Business Summit in New Delhi, PM Modi referred to the
further opening up of the single brand retail to foreign investment recently
as also allowing foreign airlines to buy stake in national carrier Air India,
saying that substantial reforms have been undertaken by his government.

""India's development agenda is huge. It presents a vast economic opportunity
for Israeli companies. I invite more and more Israeli people, businesses and
companies to come and work in India,"" he said while promising all support to
them.

In the presence of visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, PM Modi
said, ""We want to do more and do better"" to improve ease of doing business in
the country.

The role of business and industry is crucial in the transformation of ties
between the two countries, he added.

""It is your combined efforts that will add real value to our interaction and
produce concrete successes. Given the scale of the Indian economy and the
relevance of cutting-edge Israeli technologies for us, even sky is not the
limit for what we may achieve together,"" he said.

PM Modi also said that despite deep structural reforms being carried out,
India is among the fastest growing major economies.

""FDI inflows are at an all-time high, with 40 per cent rise. Tremendous work
is being done to skill and employ the youth. 65 per cent of our population is
below 35 years of age and is hungry for technology-enabled growth,"" he said.

PM Modi said India has emerged as the sixth largest manufacturing nation, ""but
we are not done yet. We are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub
leveraging the energy of our youth"".

The 'Make in India' initiative, he added, is designed to help achieve this.

""Through these initiatives, combined with the new ecosystem of a formal
economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a New India,"" PM
Modi said.

He further said the just launched India-Israel Innovation Bridge will act as a
link between the start-ups of the two nations.

""I have been saying that Indian industries, start-ups and the academic
institutions must collaborate with their Israeli counterparts to access the
huge reservoir of knowledge,"" he said.

In his speech, Netanyahu stressed on the importance of technology in sectors
like agriculture and water management.

He also talked about increasing cooperation in health sector as well as
startups.

""I believe in India because I know your heritage, your culture, your
creativity, your humanity... I came here to say Prime Minister Mr Modi, thank
you for believing in Israel the way we believe in India,"" he said.

Both leaders launched the maiden call for joint R&amp;amp;D projects under the
'India-Israel Industrial R&amp;amp;D and Technological Innovation Fund (I4F)'.

__ Comments

The 'I4Fund Call for Proposal' was announced with the joint launch of the
website and the unveiling of the brochure by the two Prime Ministers.

India and Israel will make a contribution of USD 4 million each for the Fund
annually, for five years.

**Aadhaar has built a strong base for India’s digital achievements** 

 ______ 
Aadhaar is a game-changer. It has become an important technological instrument
to empower the poor and entitle them to get their benefits without any
interruption or middlemen. In this pursuit, Aadhaar is concretising the most
important objective of Digital India: leading to digital inclusion and
empowering common Indians. It is a marvel of innovation that uses safe and
secured technology seeking to subserve the other objective of digital India
namely transformation based upon technology which is affordable, inclusive and
developmental. Today, 119 crore Indians have Aadhaar in a population of nearly
130 crore. The coverage of adult population is nearly 99%. Today, Aadhaar
stands tall as an Indian innovation, globally acknowledged as the world’s
largest digital identity programme.

One needs to understand the power of a smile on the face of a poor MGNREGA
worker who had to run from pillar to post to get his entitlements. Now with
Aadhaar linkage, MGNREGA wages are directly reaching into the bank accounts of
poor people without the extraneous influence of any middleman. It has been
widely reported in the media that with Aadhaar linkage nearly 80,000 fake
teachers were found in a very small survey of the Ministry of Human Resource
Development. Aadhaar is saving public money, which in effect is tax payers’
money. The net savings of nearly Rs. 57,000 Crore generated by disconnecting
the subsidy in case of fake gas connection or fictitious ration cards or fake
teachers will be utilised for more provisions for poor. Is it not a cause to
celebrate when transparency is shinning upon the shoulders of Aadhaar?

One basic difference in the Aadhaar of UPA and Aadhaar of NDA needs to be
appreciated. UPA-era Aadhaar was without any legislative approval: without any
backing by a Parliamentary law. The first thing the Narendra Modi government
did apart from making Aadhaar robust, safe and secure was to give it the
security of a proper legal cover backed by a Parliamentary legislation. It has
ample provisions for safe upkeep, creating a robust accountability mechanism
and most importantly, powerful privacy provisions. Unauthorised use of
biometrics data by anyone beyond permissible limits can invite severe punitive
damages as also criminal prosecution. The core biometrics — the fingerprints
and the iris — are duly protected by strong encryption.

More than six crore authentications are being done every day, nearly free of
cost. A marvel of technology confirms digital identity by comparing the query
of a number by fast matching with the iris and the fingerprint. UIDAI does not
maintain a database of services or utilities of individuals linked with
Aadhaar or individual details such as caste, religion, educational
qualifications, medical records etc. Therefore profiling of individuals based
on Aadhaar is nothing but an unfounded claim.

Aadhaar is a digital identity to supplement physical identity. Even the core
biometrics under the present law can be revealed only in case of a compelling
ground of national security when a designated joint secretary to the
government of India makes a request based upon appropriate ground and the same
is vetted and confirmed by a committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary and
comprising the Law Secretary and IT Secretary and that too for a very limited
period.

As many as 76 crore bank accounts have been verified using Aadhaar eKYC and
this only gives a digital identity to your account so that in case of abuse
for money laundering or terror funding, the ownership of the account cannot be
denied. Ordinary citizens have nothing to worry but those who are involved in
money laundering, patronising or promoting terror funding or other related
heinous offences may have a lot to worry.

Some form of digital identity has become a common practice in today’s world.
From motor vehicle licence to a voter id card containing all the details being
routinely available on websites of respective authorities these days. A
digital identity regulates entry in the Supreme Court or High Courts or
government and corporate offices or media headquarters. To visit certain
countries, one is supposed to confirm identity through fingerprints either for
obtaining the visa or for any other purpose. Under the relevant Registration
Act and Rules there are provisions that while executing land transfer
documents you need to confirm your signature with your thumb impression — a
practice being followed for more than 100 years. Even smartphones operate with
fingerprints or face-recognition systems. One is curious to note that in all
this, one does not have any objection but when it comes to Aadhaar serious
objections relating to identity verifications are raised.

The government is of the view that in accordance with the Aadhaar Act, no poor
person shall be denied his or her entitlement. Whether it is food or other
entitlements it must be provided using other identity documents and effort
shall be made to bring them on Aadhaar.

On the issue of privacy we need to have greater clarity. In the wake of the
Supreme Court judgment now the ground rule of privacy is well laid out. It is
equally important to note that under the garb of privacy innovation cannot be
killed. India is becoming a global hub of startups. Data is important for
innovation and India has the potential to emerge as a big global centre of
data analysis: the new exciting frontier of technological innovation, economy
and employment. Artificial intelligence and IoT have great potential for
innovation by using data. Most important, the plea of privacy cannot become
the shield of the corrupt and terrorists. The government has already set up a
panel under the leadership of an eminent retired judge of the Supreme Court
Justice Srikrishna, to recommend for a robust data protection law and we
expect the report soon.

However, it needs to be reiterated that the Aadhaar ecosystem, as far as
safety and security of the core biometrics is concerned, is very safe and
reliable and is subject to regular audits by experts. The UIDAI has recently
added another feather in its cap by making provision for virtual ID for those
who desire virtual ID coverage over Aadhaar numbers.

The success of Aadhaar is finding its resonance world over. The World
Development Report 2016 released by the World Bank stated, “A digital
identification system such as India’s Aadhaar, by overcoming complex
information problems, helps willing governments promote the inclusion of
disadvantaged groups.”

The poor man is happy and feels empowered. Aadhaar has given a big aadhaar
(base) to India’s digital accomplishments. It is time to recognise its worth.

**First 100 days of GST: The big shake up**

The goods and services tax (GST) saw manufacturers slow down production in the
preceding months, pulling down economic growth in the first quarter of this
fiscal to a three-year low of 5.7%. Growth picked up in the second quarter as
firms restocked their supply chain. Businesses struggled to file returns on
time in August, prompting deadline extensions. GST Council raised taxes on
cars and tobacco, lowered rates on many mass use items and gave relief to
small companies and exporters.

**1 July:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former President Pranab Mukherjee launch GST from the Central Hall of Parliament.

The first day of GST witnesses a blackout in sales of consumer durables such
as cars and refrigerators.

**5 August:** GST Council lowers tax rates on a few services.

**17 August:** Government extends deadline for filing returns for July to 28 August in cases where a rebate for tax paid in the previous regime is claimed.

**19 August:** GST implementation committee extends deadline for filing of returns and to pay taxes for July sales from 20 August to 25 August.

**9 September:** GST Council raises cess on medium to large cars and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the range of 2-7 percentage points.

**15 September:** Central Board of Excise and Customs orders verification of large tax credit claims.

**6 October:** GST Council cuts tax rates on 27 items; allows duty-free import of goods for export production under two pre-GST era schemes; small taxpayers with up to Rs1.5 crore sales allowed to file detailed tax returns and pay taxes on a quarterly basis. Composition scheme threshold raised to Rs1 crore from Rs75 lakh for most states. Small tax payers up to Rs1.5 crore of sales exempted from paying GST on advances received.

**GST@200 days: A work in progress**

Policymakers strive to ease the compliance burden of small firms and give
relief to the common man by way of massive tax cuts. The move affects

**16 October:** A panel set up by GST Council decides to do away with a distinction between airconditioned and non-airconditioned restaurants.

**26 October:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi says GST will eventually lead to lower prices, benefiting the poor and the middle class.

**10 November:** GST Council announces across-the-board tax cuts. Close to 180 items moved from the 28% to 18% tax slab. Rate on restaurants slashed to 5% for all restaurants from 12% for non-AC and 18% for AC restaurants. Restaurants in five-star hotels remain in 18% slab with tax credits.

**28 November:** Government names B.N. Sharma chairman of the National Anti-Profiteering Authority.

**West Bengal, Kerala, Odisha opt out of Centre's aspirational districts scheme** 

 ______ 
Three opposition ruled states –West Bengal, Kerala and Odisha — have opted out
of the Centre’s Transformation of Aspirational Districts scheme, thus reducing
the total number of districts under the programme to 102 from 115, a senior
Niti Aayog official said. While the West Bengal is ruled by All India
Trinamool Congress (AITMC), Kerala and Odisha have CPI-M and BJD governments,
respectively. “These three states (West Bengal, Kerala, and Odisha) have opted
out of the programme,” a senior Niti Aayog official told PTI. According to
another government official, the three states have objected to the criteria
set up by the centre for identifying backward districts without taking states
into confidence. The Centre has embarked upon a major policy initiative for
rapid transformation of districts that are lagging on specific development
parameters.

Senior government officials in the ranks of additional secretary and joint
secretary have been designated as officers in-charge to coordinate the efforts
of the Centre and states in addressing the specific developmental needs of
these districts.

Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed the
conference of 115 aspirational districts. It was attended by collectors and
officers-in-charge of 115 backward districts. During the conference, Modi has
also promised to personally visit one well-performing district by April 14,
the birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar.

Government think-tank Niti Aayog had also said that it will come out with a
ranking of 115 aspirational districts by April 2018 on 10 parameters, which
will include nutrition, education and health. The Aayog has also said it will
also set up a mechanism for real-time monitoring of government’s development
programmes by April 2018.

**Rahul Gandhi as ‘Lord Ram’ poster in Amethi lands this Congress leader in legal soup, FIR lodged; details here** 

 ______ 
Rama Shankar Shukla, a Congress leader, allegedly portrayed Gandhi as Lord
Rama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Ravana in one of the posters
installed to welcome Congress chief in the district.

Rahul Gandhi in Amethi: Congress leaders are leaving no stone unturned to
impress their boss Rahul Gandhi, who is on his first visit to his
parliamentary constituency of Amethi after taking over as the party president.
In the same row, a party worker put up a a poster which didn’t go down well
with the BJP. Rama Shankar Shukla, a Congress leader, allegedly portrayed
Gandhi as Lord Rama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Ravana in one of the
posters installed to welcome Congress chief in the district.

The poster was seen at the Gauriganj railway station on December 14, a day
before Rahul’s visit to the city. In the poster, Rahul was seen carrying a bow
and an arrow, pointing towards Prime Minister Modi. Some of the local BJP
leaders raised objections to the poster as soon as it appeared. Later, BJP
leader Surya Prakash Tiwari lodged an FIR against Shukla.

In its inscription, the poster states Rahul as an incarnation of Lord Ram who
will bring ‘Ram Rajya’ in 2019 by winning the General election, and defeating
‘Ravan’ Prime Minister Modi. “Rahul ke roop mein bhagwan Ram ka Avtaar 2019
mein aayega Rahulraj (Ramrajya)” read the wording on the poster.

The poster is said to be displayed by a local named Abhay Shukla, who claims
to have no connection with the Congress party. “Prime Minister Modi promised
us to bring black money back that is stashed abroad, but nothing happened. All
the promises made by him were lies. We believe that in 2019, Rahul Gandhi will
become the Prime Minister of the county and fulfill all the promises,” Shukla
was quoted as saying by ANI. The district unit of the Congress party denied
putting up the poster or any link with Shukla.

Earlier today, PTI reported that Gandhi faced protests from BJP workers when
his convoy was leaving Salon, which falls in Amethi Lok Sabha constituency but
is in Rae Bareli district.

Gandhi embarked on his visit to Amethi on Monday. The Congress chief has plans
to touch each of the five Assembly segments that fall under it to interact
with the public and party workers. Also, the party has made grand arrangements
to make Gandhi’s visit a success.

On Sunday Congress leaders both in Lucknow and Amethi held day-long meetings
to prepare, Indian Express reports. Among the arrangements, workers had
planned to welcome Rahul with drum beats and a showering of petals.

A review meeting was also held by state party chief Raj Babbar to know about
the preparations. In Lucknow alone, at least 16 welcome points have been
planned by the party workers and leaders, some sources told The Indian
Express.

**VHP's Praveen Togadia gets support from unlikely allies - Hardik Patel, Congress** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The

VHP

's

Praveen Togadia

today got a show of support from two unlikely allies, in the form of

Hardik Patel

and

Congress

leader Arjun Modhwadia, after he alleged earlier in the day that unspecified
people are out to get him.

Togadia's allegations, largely being seen as an attack on either PM Narendra
Modi, or one-time VHP pal

BJP

, or both, came a day after he briefly went missing and then was found
unconscious in Shahibaug in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He claimed Rajasthan police is
harassing him. Both states are ruled by the BJP.

His seeming anti-Modi allegations brought

Patidar

leader Patel and the Congress's Modhwadia to his hospital bedside this
afternoon.

Another Congress leader,

Ashok Gehlot

, who's a former Rajasthan chief minister (CM), hinted at the reason for this
unlikely coming together with Togadia.

""Togadia ji was arrested in my CM tenure also. He is from the ruling party and
if this can happen to him, what can happen with common people?"" he said,
referring to the fact that the VHP is for all practical purposes a BJP ally.

Togadia earlier today called a media conference and alleged that people were
trying to prevent him from speaking about the Ram temple and the cow slaughter
law. He claimed attempts are being made to frame him in fake cases and said
that someone might be trying to get him killed in a fake encounter. He also
claimed Rajasthan police came to arrest him yesterday in a decades-old case.

""I am being targeted for a decades-old case, there is an attempt to suppress
my voice. Rajasthan Police team came to arrest me. Someone told me plan was
being made to kill me in an encounter,"" alleged a tearful Togadia.

Togadia then said there was no case against him in Rajasthan. The VHP leader
further said he ""will not be silenced and will continue to work for Hindus""
and their welfare. He also said all Hindu organisations should unite.

Togadia, whose title is 'international working president' of the VHP, was said
to be missing yesterday morning and was found unconscious in Ahmedabad's
Shahibaug area in the evening. Ahmedabad crime branch sources said Togadia,
62, was then admitted to hospital as he was suffering from low blood sugar.

The VHP claimed that Togadia was detained by the Rajasthan Police in
connection with a case. However, the mystery over Togadia 's disappearance
deepened, when a senior police officer said that neither the local Sola police
nor the Rajasthan Police had arrested him.

**Govt scraps Haj subsidy, says will use funds to ’empower minorities’** 

 ______ 
In a big move, the government on Tuesday withdrew subsidy for Haj pilgrims.
Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi made this announcement. The
minister added that “Haj subsidy funds will be used for educational
empowerment of girls and women of minority community.” He also told reporters
that despite the subsidy withdrawal, a record number of 1.75 lakh Muslims will
undertake the pilgrimage this year.

The decision to abolish Haj subsidy comes day after government allowed Muslim
women, above the age of 45, to go on haj without male guardian, in a group of
at least four. The Ministry of Minority Affairs had, last year, constituted a
committee to review the existing Haj policy and suggest a framework for a new
Haj policy for 2018-22.

Naqvi also said that the Saudi Arabian government has in principle agreed to
allow Haj journey from India by ships and officials of the two countries will
sit together to finalise the modalities. “This is part of our policy to
empower minorities with dignity and without appeasement,” Naqvi told reporters
and cited a host of measures for the welfare of minorities.

Haj pilgrims waiting at airport

Last year, Naqvi had said that the Centre would abolish the subsidy for Haj
pilgrims in accordance with a Supreme Court order.  
“A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had, during the Congress regime
in 2012, directed that the Haj subsidy be done away with. Hence, in the new
policy, as per the recommendations of a committee, we have decided to do away
with the Haj subsidy gradually,” he had said.

The Haj subsidy is given to Muslim Hajj pilgrims by the government in form of
discounted fares on Air India. It also includes assistance to Muslim pilgrims
for domestic travel to reach specially designed Haj departure airport
terminals, medical cares, lodging assistance and meal. The subsidy program has
its origins in British colonial era. In 2008, the total subsidy provided by
the government was US$1,815 per Muslim pilgrim.

According to sources in the minority affairs ministry, till 2017, the notional
savings following gradual abolition of subsidy since 2012 was to tune of Rs
636.56 crore. In case, the government had chosen to reduce the subsidy
gradually till 2022, the total national savings would have have been around Rs
5970.6 crore, the sources said.

The government’s decision on revoking Haj subsidy has no meaning as there was
no such concession and Muslims were being cheated in its name, the All India
Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) said.

“The subsidy was not given to those going on Haj but it was for Air India that
is running in losses. It was an eyewash. Muslims were cheated in the name of
the subsidy,” AIMPLB General Secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani told PTI.

“In normal days, tickets for Saudi Arabia come for Rs 32,000 but during Haj,
Air India used to charge Rs 65,000 to Rs 1 lakh from those going for Haj. The
fare will be less without subsidy,” he said.

Reacting cautiously to the government’s decision, the Congress said it hopes
that the Modi government will honour the apex court’s direction and utilise
this money for the education and development of the disempowered among the
minorities, including young girls.

Welcoming the Centre’s decision, the Vishva Hindu Parishad said the money
saved from it should be utilised for the education of poor Hindu girls.

229,"Well, unpopular it may be, lets work with your opinion as it is .. that Rahul is not all that bad.

But not all that bad .... FOR WHAT ??? As a human, as an MP, as a political leader, as a PM aspirant ? From what you seem to suggest, I take it you are looking at his political leadership. So let's look at that. 

Rahul Gandhi became the President of the Congress Party .. after about 14 years of being involved in politics at any level. In fact, he was the face of the elections and the PM aspirant (that is, likely to be PM if the Congress had its way) in 2014.. 10 years after his entry into politics at any level. 

What exactly led him to be any of these 2 claims .. in terms of his political work/leadership/acumen in the 10 years ? Can he rightfully claim any of those on the basis of any objective ""he's not that bad after all"" ? 

Political speeches ? Okay.. I wish you had something better to argue here.. Like I can name 10 other political leaders.. who I absolutely do not agree with, but are better at political speeches than Rahul. In fact, many within the congress itself - both in Hindi and English - who make far better points. So while you may say - ""he's not that bad after all"" - What is he not bad at all for and compared to whom ? 

The problem with Rahul is not that he's not that bad ... but a more fundamental and deep-rooted principle. He is part of a system which has completely shunned meritocracy. When comparing Rahul, there are nobody within his party who you can compare him with .. the entire game is skewed for him to claim credit and discount failures. Its shabby, ugly and for all to see. 

Like or Dislike Modi, or for that matter Vajpayee, they spent decades reaching where they did, and come failure they will have to go (as ABV did). With Rahul, it may be that the Congress is stuck with him for the next 3 decades - which makes this ""not so bad after all"" dangerous. Coz if he's going to stay there regardless of your change of opinion. He's going to be the Congress's only face for the next 30 years. 

To say that the media is biased against Rahul is fine... probably true in some cases, but are you saying the media was not against Modi before he became PM or even after .. especially the Delhi English media ? FFS ..""Big blow to Modi"" was a running theme on channels ?  The point is .. Modi and his party won UP after demonitization. In fact, had he lost it narrowly .. like the Congress in Gujarat.. Modi would still have got far worse than Rahul did for Gujarat. 

The basic point is ... political leaders must be assessed on their political successes and failures. The guy with the best intent and shit understanding of the pulse of people (there are many like that) cant claim any sympathy. ",2018-01-16 23:25:39

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The nondescript villages of Chand Sarai in Lucknow and Haidariya in

Ghazipur

will be the two ends of the country's longest expressway. The Yogi Adityanath-
led

Uttar Pradesh

government has finalised details of the 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway,
which will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 13,186 crore by the end
of 2020.

Prime Minister

is expected to lay the foundation stone of the project in February or March.
Uttar Pradesh has secured assurances from banks for a loan of Rs 15,000 crore
for the project, of which Rs 2,000 crore has already been released, an
indication that lack of finances will not come in the way of completing the
project in the targeted 30 months.

Besides being the country's longest six-lane expressway, linking Uttar
Pradesh's capital to the state's eastern end, the other unique selling point
of the highway is that it will connect the state's 'three temple towns' o f
Varanasi ,

Ayodhya

and Allahabad.

While Varanasi will be connected through a widened NH that will crisscross the
expressway, the state's Public Works Department will build a link road to
Ayodhya from the expressway. The state government has also decided to build a
new link expressway that will branch out of the Purvanchal Expressway and go
till Allahabad. The government is also doing pre-feasibility study to link the
expressway to the chief minister's home town of Gorakhpur, besides a link up
with the new Bundelkhand Expressway being built from Jhansi to Kushinagar.

""This expressway will bring about development of eastern districts by
connecting these to the state capital and further to Agra and national capital
Delhi through Agra-Lucknow Expressway and

Yamuna Expressway

. The expressway has the potential to be linked with Patna- Buxar National
Highway (NH 922) at Bharauli through NH 19/31,"" the state government has said
in a request for qualification (RFQ) document, inviting bids through
international competitive bidding for constructing the expressway.

ET had in October reported plans of linking Delhi with Patna by a series of
expressways and highways that could reduce the ride to just 11 hours. Work is
expected to start on the Purvanchal Expressway this April, with the entire
stretch being divided into eight packages of 28-54 km each, which could be
awarded to different companies. The six-lane expressway will be designed for
speeds of 120 km/hr with the option of converting it to eight-lane.

**Haj subsidy ends, funds to go into minority education** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: In keeping with

Supreme Court

orders and its own political plank, the Modi government will no longer provide
subsidy to

Haj

pilgrims and has pledged that funds saved will be used for the education of
minorities, particularly girl children.

""There will be no subsidy for Haj from this year,"" minority affairs minister

Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi

told the media on Tuesday during an interaction at the BJP headquarters and
said that the move is part of an effort to ""empower minorities without
appeasement"".

The decision is a political signal as well, as BJP has argued that the
subsidy, essentially for air travel, is a demonstrative sop for Muslims and a
diversion of funds that might be better utilised.

Significantly, the decision did not evoke a protest from Congress, which
maintained it has no objections to the end of the subsidy as long as the funds
were utilised for minority welfare.

#### Saudi Arabia okays India's plan to ferry Haj pilgrims via sea route:
Naqvi

""Saudi Arabia has given its nod to revive the option of sending pilgrims by
sea route...Officials from both the countries will discuss all the necessary
formalities and technicalities so that Haj pilgrimage through sea route can be
started in the coming years,"" Naqvi said according to the statement.

BJP functionaries, however, emphasised that Congress had shown no urgency to
act on the matter when it was in office after the SC ruled in May 2012 that
the subsidy be eliminated in 10 years. While subsidies have been dismantled, a
record number of 1.75 lakh Muslims will go on the Haj pilgrimage this year,
Naqvi said and claimed that this will be the highest since Independence.

The government will invest what it saves for minority education. It had spent
over Rs 250 crore last year on subsidising the travel to Saudi Arabia, he
said. Restrictions on pilgrims having to take flights from their place of stay
or nearest airports have been relaxed and this will lead to cheaper air
travel, Naqvi said. It will also allow Haj travellers to take advantage of
bulk bookings while the government will continue to spend on medical expenses.

The decision to end the subsidy for Haj pilgrims follows a 2012 Supreme Court
order to do away with the subsidy, long sought by BJP. Following the order,
the subsidy was gradually rolled back and has now ended.

Naqvi said allowing choice of embarkation port gives pilgrims the option of
cheaper travel. A pilgrim from Gaya would pay Rs 1,20,000 but if he or she
travels from Kolkata, the cost would be Rs 70,000. Similarly, it would cost Rs
1,10,000 from Srinagar but the cost would come down to Rs 60,000 from Delhi.
The cost would be Rs 1 lakh from Indore and Rs 58,000 from Mumbai,
respectively, the minister said. These are figures according to 2017 rates.

The Saudi Arabian government has agreed to allow Indians to go on Haj by the
sea route and officials of the two countries will work out the modalities, he
said. Haj pilgrims from certain regions will have an additional option to
choose from where they want to fly to Saudi Arabia for the annual pilgrimage,
he said and claimed that this would bring down the cost by up to 70 per cent
on some routes.

The minister said, in a first,

over 1,300 women would go on Haj without a ""mehram+

(male guardian)"", a practice done away with from this year. Female Haj
assistants would accompany them and the government has made arrangements for
their stay in Saudi Arabia.

Some Muslim leaders said the subsidy was an eyewash. ""The subsidy was not
given to those going on Haj but it was for

Air India

that is running in losses,"" All India Muslim Personal Law Board general
secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani told PTI in Lucknow.

""In normal days, tickets for Saudi Arabia come for Rs 32,000 but during Haj,
Air India used to charge Rs 65,000 to Rs 1 lakh from those going for Haj. The
fare will be less without subsidy,"" he said.

All India Shia Personal Law Board

chairman Yasoob Abbas, on the other hand, told PTI the board favoured subsidy
on Haj as he said it benefited the poor.

**Baby Moshe who lost parents in 26/11 attacks arrives in Mumbai to unveil memorial, will visit Gateway** 

 ______ 
Moshe Holtzberg, who survived the 26/11 siege at Nariman House in Mumbai but
lost his parents in it, arrived in the city on Tuesday morning for the first
time since their death.

“Shalom ... Bahut khushi (I am very happy),” a shy Moshe told news agency ANI
after arriving at Mumbai airport a little after 8am.

The 11-year-old was accompanied by his maternal and paternal grandparents.
“It’s a very special day. Thank God that Moshe could come again. Mumbai is a
lot more safe now,” his grandfather Rabbi Holztberg Nachman was quoted saying
at the airport by ANI.

The visit comes almost six months after the young boy met Prime Minister
Narendra Modi on July 5, 2017, and expressed a desire to visit the country.
India then issued 10-year multiple entry visas to Moshe and his grandparents.

Tuesday. (Bhushan Koyande/ HT Photo)

Moshe said he would visit the Jewish centre in Colaba where his parents, Rabbi
Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, were killed in the terror attacks in November
2008, and pray there. The couple had moved to Mumbai seven years earlier and
were serving as directors of the cultural and outreach centre for the
worldwide Chabad-Lubavitch movement when they were killed along with six
others. Moshe was saved by his Indian nanny Sandra Samuels.

The young boy, who was just two days short of turning two when the attack took
place, will unveil a memorial dedicated to the victims of the 26/11 terror
attacks, along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on January 18 at
Nariman House.

After his parents’ deaths, Moshe’s maternal grandparents took him to Afula, a
city in Israel, where he now lives.

Rabbi Israel Kozolovasky, who now heads Nariman House in Colaba, said they
would be preparing a special meal for the boy. “We are excited because this is
Baby Moshe’s first visit to India in nine years. His visit to Nariman House is
emotional and sensitive because this is where he received the last hug from
his mother and the last kiss from his father,” Kozolovasky said.

He added that Moshe was also looking forward to visiting the Gateway of India.
“Apart from Nariman House, the second place Moshe wants to see is the Gateway
of India,” Kozolovasky said.

The work on the memorial at Nariman House is expected to be partially complete
by the 10th anniversary of the attacks, and might open for public then.

242,"He hasn't ""inaugrated"" tgis project. It was inaugurated in 2013 by Congress government. But no work was allowed to start because Congress lost the election in Rajasthan and BJP government put a stay on the proceedings. Then the new government made a new and improved MoU with HPCL and again put the project on hold. 

The project was green-lit in early 2017 and the work has started now. It is the commencement of work program, and not the inauguration, which was done by PM Modi. Very convenient timing, as there are elections in Rajasthan later this year. 

There was a piss-take on Congress government and a superficial excuse as to why it took 4 years to get this project going, but really the audience didn't care. They were happy and excited just to have a look at Modiji and hear him speak.

Anything that involves communal violence (only Hindus attacking minorities) will be blamed as it happened under BJP government. 


Isn't that a targetted harrassment too?


Indeed, there are some criminals finding a safe haven within BJP, name shame them, expose those scoundrels with valid proof.


Instead, bring up something like ""[insert Hindu-Muslim violence], communal violence is rise under Modi rule"" template shows, other paid media are in a desperate attempt to accuse this government or a click-bait journalism.

**AAP a one-man party, not a people’s party, says Mumbai-based ex-AAP leader in his book** 

 ______ 
Is the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) a public movement that went awry and lost sight
of its goal owing to its captain Arvind Kejriwal? Former AAP leader and one of
the party’s founding members Mayank Gandhi certainly thinks so. In his new
book ‘AAP &amp;amp; Down’, the social activist claims to have “exposed” the
intricacies and political cross currents that he feels ultimately turned what
had started as a “people’s movement” into a “cloak and dagger” political
party, with its own share of intrigue and “closed door” politics. This book
will be launched on February 18.

The book blames Kejriwal and his coterie for all that the author thinks went
wrong within the AAP. “Anyone who questioned Kejriwal was shown the door and
it has now become a one-man party instead of a people’s party,” alleges
Mumbai-based Gandhi in his book.

He cites the example of himself, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan who were
shown the door. Calling his book the account of the “second Independence”
struggle, he outlines the details starting from the Anna Hazare-led Indian
Against Corruption (IAC), where the foundation of AAP was first laid. He said
the 2013 Delhi assembly elections were fought on basis of principle and
transparency.

However, things changed after the 2014 parliamentary elections when Narendra
Modi swept the polls. “There was a change in the thinking and AAP adopted the
same tactics other political parties did in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls like
taking defectors in its fold and considering winning the only aim. This is
where the slide started,” he said. “Arvind Kejriwal thought that this will
also work in other states but then it backfired in places like Goa and
Punjab.”

He said the problem was that the Five Founding principles of AAP —
participation, accountability, transparency, decentralization of power and
integrity — were compromised in the bargain. “Why are the coterie members not
taking onus of the defeats and resigning? Why are there no booth-level
elections being held to encourage decentralisation? Why are no accounts being
disclosed on the websites?” asked Gandhi.

The ex-AAP leader also said he was expelled after he wrote a blog post in
March 2015 about the proceedings of the national executive. “I was a
representative of lakhs of volunteers and they needed to know what was going
on. However, Kejriwal and others took offence and I was sacked,” he said.

According to Gandhi, in the first AAP national executive meeting, Kejriwal had
said, “This party is not the property of 300 founding members but of the lakhs
and crores of people in this country.” However, over the period of time, he
told Gandhi that “I do not want intellectuals in the party, just people who
say ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and unquestioningly follow me”.

But Gandhi does credit AAP also for shaking the conscience of the people.
“Politicians were getting grilled, questioned and good people started entering
this field, all thanks to AAP,” said Gandhi while adding that the Delhi
government performed well in social infrastructure like schools and health
sector.

However AAP has criticised Gandhi saying he has no moral grounds to talk of
AAP. “Mayank Gandhi was removed as he concealed information on being named in
an FIR (first information report) which was against the AAP’s Constitution.
The problem with such people who are removed from AAP is they need to attack
AAP and Kejriwal to remain in news since they have no other identity,” said
Priti Sharma Menon, national executive member, AAP. “AAP was only becoming
stronger by the day. Today we are ruling in Delhi, we are the main opposition
party in Punjab and also have members in the Rajya Sabha. Kejriwal’s work is
appreciated all across despite hurdles and we have not deviated from our core
agenda.”

If, on the other hand, you are interested in discussing matters of government policy, you'll see that you are wasting inordinate amounts of time in discussing masala added by politicians to a serious point about policy. You could very easily have made a point that Owaisi is barking up the wrong tree, while at the same time saying that government subsidy at any level to religious trips need to go. It took a long thread to finally get you to admit that there's a bigger policy issue here.

&gt; My apartment security guaranteed by local police has utility for me and not for you. 

Unless a cop is stationed specifically outside your apartment, the local police is guardinb everyone in your locality, and I have the same protection from my local police, both of which get paid out of both our taxes. If the cop is specifically guarding your apartment, you need to pay for security, unless protecting your arse is determined to be in national interest using due process.

**Blow to Make in India, Japanese companies grab all key contracts of Modi's bullet train** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI/TOKYO: Japanese

steel and engineering

companies are in the driver's seat to bag major supply contracts for a $17
billion Indian

bullet train

, several sources said, undermining a key component of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi's economic policy - a push to 'Make in

India

'.

Japan

is funding most of the project, and Japanese companies are likely to supply at
least 70 percent of the core components of the rail line, said five sources in
New Delhi with direct knowledge of the matter.

A spokesman for Modi's office declined comment.

A Japanese transport ministry official involved in the project said the two
countries were still working out a strategy for the supply of key components,
and would unveil a plan for procurements around July. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.

The September 2017 agreement between Japan and India for the bullet train
project included two clauses - the promotion of 'Make in India' and 'Transfer
of Technology' - through which New Delhi had hoped to set up manufacturing
facilities in the country, generate jobs and get a toehold in Japanese
technology. Modi faces a general election in 2019 and is under pressure to
provide more jobs to millions of unemployed in India. Critics also say the
bullet train is wasteful and that the money could be better used elsewhere.

""The Japanese have reservations on certain issues because they have a concern
that there is a difference in the culture and systems of Japan from the
culture and systems in India,"" said Achal Khare, the managing director of
National High Speed Rail Corp Ltd (NHSRCL), the agency tasked to execute the
bullet train project.

""The work culture is very different,"" he told Reuters.

Khare did not elaborate but two Indian railways officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said their Japanese counterparts had raised questions
about efficiency in Indian companies and their ability to meet timelines.

The World Bank currently ranks India 100th out of 190 nations on the ease of
doing business, giving it relatively low marks for starting a business,
enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits.

Tomoyuki Nakano, director for international engineering affairs in the railway
bureau at Japan's transport ministry, said the issue was that Indian companies
had no experience or technologies specialising in high-speed railway systems
at present.

""I don't think Japanese are concerned about a difference in the work culture,""
Nakano said. He and other Japanese officials said efforts were continuing to
fulfil the 'Make in India' component of the agreement by promoting
collaborations between companies from the two countries.

Still, several Indian officials said it was by and large accepted that Indian
companies would not have a major part to play in the bullet train project.

Japan will get major leeway because the bullet train is largely funded by a
50-year loan provided by its government, said a close aide of Modi, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.

""At this stage to expect Indian companies to have a bigger share in
manufacturing appears to be a little difficult,"" said a senior official at the
Indian government's policy think-tank,

NITI Aayog

, who is involved in the negotiations.

Modi's flagship 'Make in India' initiative aims to lift the share of
manufacturing in India's $2 trillion economy to 25 percent and create 100
million jobs by 2022.

However, midway through Modi's five-year term, manufacturing was still at 17
percent of India's GDP in the 2016/17 financial year from 15 percent
previously.

** ONLY ONE JOINT VENTURE   
**** **

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for India's first
bullet train in September last year. It will link Mumbai with Ahmedabad, the
largest commercial city in Modi's home state Gujarat.

Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, Japan's biggest steelmaker, and other
companies like JFE Holdings Inc , Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd are likely to bid for
various contracts, said three senior Indian government officials directly
involved in the project.

Nippon Steel said it would not comment on specific projects.

JFE, Hitachi and Toshiba said they were interested in the project but had not
finalised plans, including any possibilities of joint ventures with Indian
firms.

Mitsubishi Heavy said it had not decided if it wanted to be involved.

The sole collaboration aimed at the bullet train project is between Kawasaki
Heavy Industries and India's Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, which aims to win
carriage orders.

Japanese government officials have asked for more bullet train corridors in
India before transferring technology, three senior Indian officials said.

But New Delhi is unlikely to announce any new projects until the final cost
and commercial feasibility of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad link is clear, the
officials said.

""It's like a chicken and egg situation on technology. The Japanese want an
economy of scale and business but the Indian view is that India is a big
market that once this market is explored the business will automatically be
generated,"" said Khare from NHSRCL.

**MISSED OPPORTUNITY**

New Delhi has tried to help Indian steel companies grab a slice of the pie.

The Indian government last year mediated negotiations between Nippon Steel and
India's Jindal Steel and Power Ltd to set up a joint venture to manufacture
rails, but the talks fell through after the Japanese major raised quality
concerns, three sources in New Delhi said.

State-owned Steel Authority of India (SAIL), which for decades has been the
main supplier of rails to Indian Railways, was also overlooked by Japanese
companies due to quality concerns, the sources said.

Nippon Steel declined comment and while Jindal and SAIL did not reply to
e-mails seeking comment.

Left with little choice, Indian firms will now largely provide raw materials
like cement and supply manpower for the assembly of rails, the sources said.

India's UltraTech Cement Ltd, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Ltd , Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd are among those in the race for the
supply of construction materials and power, the two Indian railways officials
said.

These companies did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

**Madrasas should be modernised, closure is not a solution: Yogi Adityanath** 

 ______ 
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Thursday that the closure
of madrasas is not a solution and instead called for imparting modern
education not just in the Islamic institutions but also in Sanskrit schools.

Adityanath was speaking at a meeting between the Centre and minority welfare
ministers of several states in the presence of Union minority affairs minister
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.

“We can think about modernisation of madrasas. Closing them down is not a
solution but timely improvements should be considered. I also ask Sanskrit
schools that besides imparting traditional education they should give
computer, English, Science and Mathematics education to face competition,” he
said.

Adityanath’s comments come days after state Shia Waqf board chief Waseem Rizvi
called for madrasas to be shut down, calling the institutions a breeding
ground for terrorists. The comments have triggered condemnation and uproar
among the Muslim community, and some have even issued a fatwa against him.

The state has around 16,000 madrasas that offer courses in Islamic theology
and religious laws. Around 560 of them are government-aided and 4,500 are
partially funded by the state. The government gives around Rs 4 to Rs 5 lakh
to every aided madrasa.

The state government has brought in a series of regulation in an apparent bid
to modernise madrasas and bring them at par with other schools. It launched a
portal of UP madrasa board in August last year for the online registration of
all such Islamic institutions in a bid to check “irregularities”, improving
quality of education, and transparency.

The madrasa board has also started preparation to introduce books by the
National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in the Islamic
seminaries to standardise and improve the curriculum in sync with job
requirements.

“We are not able to utilise energy of those who are misguided in ‘Rashtra
Nirman’ (nation building). Only quality education is the solution. Our
government is committed to development without any discrimination.”

At the Thursday event, the chief minister also said there was no
discrimination in the state in implementing welfare schemes for the
minorities.

“Disgruntlement is bound to brew when there is discrimination. We have
verified and issued 37 lakh ration cards without any discrimination. Prime
Minister Narendra Modi has launched skill development programme, which is
aimed to provide employment opportunities to youths of the minority
community,” he said.

The chief minister said everybody wants to live with dignity and minorities
were no exception.

“But unnecessary controversies are raked up whenever we have tried to raise
issues for their (minorities) betterment,” he said adding that minority
welfare department had a very important role to play in this.

Adityanath also thanked Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
for choosing UP for the conference.

“The main agenda of the programme is development with dignity and empowerment
of minorities without appeasement. Various developmental measures initiated by
different state governments for education and socio-economic development will
come up for discussion,” Naqvi, who is holding the brainstorming meeting with
the states and Union territories, said.

Naqvi said education would also be a focus area of the discussion, especially
that of Muslim girls.

Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakahand, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab participated in the meeting.

**Opinion: Second Major Case Of Team Modi Misusing Supreme Court Order** 

 ______ 
In a secular country such as India, should public money be used to fund
individuals to join religious

_yatras_

of their choice? If someone wants to travel to Mecca or to Mansarovar, should
the government use public money to fund them? These questions arise with the
recent decision of the government to end the Haj subsidy.

Announcing the government's decision to abolish the Haj subsidy, Minority
Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the decision is in accordance with a
2012 Supreme Court order. He also said ""It is part of the Modi government's
efforts to empower minorities with dignity and without appeasement.""

If the end of government subsidies for individual pilgrims traveling to Mecca
brings back dignity to Muslims, why not bring back dignity to Hindus? Why give
subsidies to Hindu pilgrims? If it is appeasement to subsidize pilgrims to
Mecca, is it empowerment to subsidize pilgrims to Mansarovar, Ayodhya and
other such places considered holy by Hindus?

Within a week of taking over as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi
Adityanath announced a big hike in the subsidy for the pilgrimage to Kailash
Mansarovar to upto one lakh rupees per

_yatri_

. The Rajasthan Government also provides a similar subsidy. The Madhya Pradesh
Government provides a range of subsidies, including for senior citizens, to
Ayodhya and Mathura and further afield to those travelling to temple
destinations in Sri Lanka, Kampuchea and Pakistan. Other state governments
which give such subsidies to individual Hindu pilgrims in organized

_yatras_

to identified religious destinations are Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Haryana,
Tamil Nadu; more recently, Delhi has in a new scheme increased the subsidy to
individual senior citizens participating in religious

_yatras_

. These subsidies range from 25,000 rupees to one lakh rupees given to
individual pilgrims. This is apart from the other general arrangements made.

Haj subsidy, besides cheaper fares on Air India, also included help to
pilgrims to reach specially-designed Haj departure terminals at airports, food
and medical care

There is certainly a difference between subsidies to individual pilgrims and
money spent by governments to ensure the safety and well-being of the hundreds
and thousands of people who participate in events such as the

_Kumbh Mela_

or the

_Sabarimala Yatra_

. When thousands and lakhs congregate at a particular site to offer worship
without adequate arrangements made by governments, there could be accidents,
injuries and sometimes tragic deaths. In that sense, it is wrong of Member of
Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi to have compared Haj subsidies to expenses for
arrangements at religious functions.

The Supreme Court order referred to by the Minority Affairs Minister was
concerning funds for individual pilgrims. However, the order gave a ten-year
period to the government to phase out the subsidies to Haj pilgrims. It stated
""(we) direct Central Government, progressively reduce amount of subsidy so as
to completely eliminate it within a period of ten years from today..."" which
would be May 2022. But the central government has terminated the subsidy for
Haj completely within five years, which is a violation of the Supreme Court
directions, even as state governments headed by the BJP-RSS are increasing
subsidies for Hindu pilgrims.

It is these conflicting and contrasting policies on an issue of state
subsidies for religious activities which underline the arbitrary and motivated
nature of the decision to terminate the Haj subsidy.

As far as the May 2012 Supreme Court judgement on the Haj is concerned,
contrary to the claim of the minister, it had nothing to do with
constitutional issues. The two-member bench of Justice Altaf Alam and Justice
Ranjana Desai were hearing a bunch of petitions from private travel operators
who were aggrieved by certain orders issued by the then union government
setting down conditions for their registration. The Bombay High Court had
stayed the government orders and it was the union government which approached
the Supreme Court in a petition to lift the stay. The issue of the abolition
of Haj subsidy was not asked for by the petitioners or by the union
government. It was entirely extraneous to the matter at hand and was a most
unexpected direction of the court. But even while giving such a direction, the
court held that giving such a subsidy ""was not unconstitutional.""

Days ago, the government also allowed Muslim women above 45 to go on Haj
without male company, in a group of at least four

It referred to an earlier court judgement in January 2012 in a case which had
directly challenged the Haj subsidy as being unconstitutional and specifically
against Article 27 of the constitution. This was a case filed by Praful
Goradia, a former Rajya Sabha member of the BJP from Gujarat. Article 27 says
""No person shall be compelled to pay any tax, the proceeds of which are
specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for promotion or maintenance
of any particular religion or religious domination."" The bench headed by
Justices Markandey Katju and Sudha Mishra dismissed the petition, holding that
Sec 27 was not violated since only a small portion of the tax paid by citizens
for general use by the government was used for the Haj subsidy. The judgement
also noted that the government affidavit in defense mentioned other subsidies
given for religious pilgrimages including to Mansarovar and to facilitate
""pilgrimages to Sikh and Hindu pilgrims to visit temples and

_gurudwaras_

in Pakistan.""

One may not agree with this judgement, but it clearly treats all pilgrims
equally regardless of the religion they may believe in. But the government has
ignored this judgement. This is the second such example within a month when
the government has misread and misused a Supreme Court judgement to further a
narrow agenda of targeting the minority community.

On the

_talaq-e-biddat_

judgement, the government brought a bill to criminalize triple

_talaq_

in the name of the Supreme Court when the court had not in fact suggested any
such step even while it set aside this abhorrent practice. The bill has
draconian features which gives the government and the police the power to
target, charge and arrest Muslim men on a complaint by a third party who may
have nothing to do with his victimized wife. Even while it professed its
concern for the rights of Muslim women, the government was simultaneously
moving towards relaxing the laws on domestic violence under Sec 498A linked to
dowry and mental and physical harassment against women by diluting its
provisions. While

_talaq-e-biddat_

is proposed to be a non-bailable crime, the present law against violence on
dowry demands is sought to be changed to make it bailable. Why these double
standards? Similarly, in the present case of Haj subsidy, the government has
distorted the Supreme Court judgement to abolish the Haj subsidy while at the
same time it is increasing subsidies for pilgrims of the majority community.
Again, why these double standards?

The secular principle of the separation of the state from religion means that
the government should phase out subsidies to all individual pilgrims across
religions. This should not be confused with the government's responsibility to
provide security and other infrastructural facilities on occasions where large
numbers of pilgrims congregate. In no case should the government discriminate
among pilgrims of different communities in its approach. But in selectively
abolishing the Haj subsidy while increasing and promoting other such
subsidies, this is precisely what the Modi Government is doing.

**Modi @Davos: PM has to be India’s Marketing Chief** 

 ______ 
** By Sumant Sinha   
**

This year's World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting at

Davos

, Switzerland, that will take place during January 23-26 comes with a very
different background from the last few years. For one, 2017 turned out to be a
much better year for the global economy than had been anticipated.

Global growth was a healthy 3.5% and well distributed across the world. Stock
markets were on a tear, including here in India, clocking returns not seen
since the halcyon pre-financial crisis days. While there has been a lot of
talk about 'economic nationalism', nothing fundamentally changed in the global
order.

The conversation at Davos is likely to be more optimistic than it has been in
the last few years. This year's theme is 'Creating a Shared Future in a
Fractured World'.

The first subagenda, the 'Global Agenda', seeks to support efforts to improve
global governance mechanisms and advance major multilateral processes, such as
the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The 'Geopolitical Agenda' seeks to
improve the adaptation to change by global leaders. The 'Economic Agenda' will
focus on supporting sustainable and inclusive economic development, while the
'Regional Agenda' will examine the social and economic transformations
occurring across the world.

In the 'Industry and Business Agenda', participants will contribute to the
shaping of new industry ecosystems and help industry and government leaders
prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Finally, in the 'Future Agenda',
attendees will share ideas, innovations and discoveries that will have a
global impact.

About 3,000 business leaders, 350 high-ranking officials, including 60 Heads
of State and Government, will participate in the four-day forum. The presence
of US President Donald Trump has created unprecedented media attention. There
will also be French President Emmanuel Macron.

For India, this year will be even more important due to the participation of
the Indian PM after 20 years. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there are two
clear agenda points. The first is to continue to aggressively promote India as
an investment destination. We need much more investment, and what better forum
than Davos with its high concentration of global CEOs, investors and
influencers to make a pitch.

The 'Make in India' campaign needs to be re-energised for better results.
There is much for the PM to tout as far as his economic track record is
concerned, not least of which is the Goods and Services Tax (

GST

), the sound macro fundamentals, the resolution of non-performing assets
(NPAs), the structural reforms of specific sectors, and the positive outlook
for faster growth. India continues to be the fastest growing large economy in
the world with increasing consumer demand.

The PM will need to nudge foreign investors further in that direction. At
Davos, he has to be India's marketing chief. The second agenda for Modi will
be to lay out India's position in this ever-changing world, and his personal
views as the prime representative of a sixth of humanity. Are we willing to
shelve the shibboleths of the past - India's 'socialist' orientation, the
vestiges of our 'non-alignment', our aloofness from global trade and
investment, and our 'difficulties' in doing business -- and boldly take the
lead, especially as the US vacates leadership space and China rushes in to
fill the vacuum?

In such a context, the world will be comparing and contrasting the positions
of Xi Jinping from last year's forum -- where the Chinese premier appeared
willing to take on leadership for an open global order and made quite a splash
in doing so -- with the vision that Modi will present.

The PM is likely to use the Davos platform to state India's views on this
emerging new world order. India has also taken a strong domestic position on
climate change. But combating climate change needs constant leadership and the
world needs to be shepherded along in that direction. India can take the lead
in this area and Modi can put his weight behind it. So this year, Davos will
move the global agenda forward.

305,"Among the public sector firms ISRO is the top place to work if you are interested but it is VERY difficult to get into. AFAIK their work ethic and quality of work is great! But thats where it all stops. NAL and HAL are plagued with all the bureaucratic bullshit. Because of which progress of projects are slow. But the government(I mean Modi, I have heard the GOI bureaucrats are trying everything they can to still import aircrafts and stall the MII momentum) is trying to change this by asking them to deliver. HAL produced Tejas is a good example. There is a good chance these will be inducted into active duty which will pave the way for advanced fighters and a HUGE boost to the indigenous Aerospace community's morale.  

The private sector is in very nascent stage right now. It can be broken down into the biggies(Tata, Adani, Ambani) and the startups. The biggies are basically partnering with big foreign firms to set up assembly lines here. Which means, other than a few simple parts most parts will be imported and then screwed up in factories here and then sold under the MII banner.

Then come the startups. Life is hard. Team Indus dropped out of moon race. Although their is a space where we are actually making solid progress and that is in the drone market. Their are some extraordinary startups working in this field and I hope to see some really cool stuff coming out of these companies. 

It is not like Indian Aerospace engineers dont have the expertise, what we require is time and investment, motivation comes with incentive. Aircraft designing is an iterative process, meaning you design an aircraft then fly and collect data to come up with a better design. Companies like boeing and airbus have perfected their designs over 1000s of cycles of design and fabrication while HAL produced the Tejas within just &lt;30 such cycles in the organisation's lifetime and mind you its a pretty fucking good fighter (~1.6-2 Tejas can take on 1 F-16).

**Padmaavat 'bakwas', don't watch it, Asaduddin Owaisi tells Muslims** 

 ______ 
HYDERABAD: Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) president and Hyderabad MP

Asaduddin Owaisi

has described the controversial Hindi film Padmaavat as 'bakwas' (waste) and
urged Muslims not to watch the film that revolves around legendary Rajput
queen

Rani Padmavati

and emperor Alauddin Khilji.

Addressing a public meeting in Warangal city late on Wednesday night as part
of the all-India campaign on 'Save Sharia', Owaisi called on Muslims,
particularly the youth, not to watch Padmaavat and waste their time and money.
""The film is a bakwas. Do not waste your time by watching the film. It
incidentally is based on a story written by a Muslim writer,"" Owaisi said.

Asaduddin Owaisi said Padmaavat is a 'manhoos' (curse-ridden) and 'ghaleez'
(bad) film. ""Do not run after it. Do not watch it. God has not created you to
watch this two-hour film. God created you to lead a good life and do good
things that should be remembered for centuries,"" he said.

Owaisi said Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

had set up a 12-member panel to review the 'bakwas' film and suggest cuts. The
story written by poet Malik Mohammad Jayasi in 1540 is a fiction and has no
historical basis, but still the government has shown so much interest on the
movie based on a fiction.

""But when it comes to the Muslim law (triple talaq issue), the Prime Minister
did not bother to consult Muslim leaders,"" he said.

The MIM leader also asked Muslims to learn from the Rajputs who are standing
in support of their queen. ""They are showing a mirror to us. They have stood
united on the issue and they do not want the movie to be screened. But Muslims
are divided. They do not raise their voice when attempts are made to change
the Islamic law,"" he said.

Referring to VHP leader Pravin Togadia's issue, Owaisi criticised the

Congress

for its double standards in visiting him at a Gujarat hospital. Coming down
heavily on Togadia for his anti-Muslim and anit-Islam talks, he wondered how
the Congress can support such a person.

Owaisi has been touring

Telangana

and holding meetings as part of the Save Sharia campaign. Thousands of people
turned up on Wednesday at the meeting held to mobilise people against any
amendments in the Muslim personal law.

**Clarion call to PM Narendra Modi to increase funding for Science and Education** 

 ______ 
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a clarion call to the Union Government to increase
funding for science and education in the upcoming budget, Scientists and
academicians have launched a signature campaign with an online petition
addressed to the Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

, as a follow up of the March for Science. Though some scientists are hopeful
that there would be more share for science and education in the upcoming
Central budget unlike last year, they expect more support in terms of GDP.

It may be recalled that the 'India March for Science' was organised on Aug 9
last year in 40 cities across the country, urging adequate funding for
science, technology, and education, without which the dream of propelling
India forward as a scientifically advanced nation is likely to remain
unfulfilled. In Kerala, the March was led by noted space scientist and former
deputy director of ISRO's Liquid Propulsion System's P Radhakrishnan.

Though the Indian economy is the third largest in the world in terms of its
GDP (purchasing power parity), it is not reflected in the fields of science
and education because of the poor support received from the government. India
ranks 40th in terms of support for science as the R&amp;amp;D expenditure is only
around 0.85% of GDP (PPP). Developing countries like Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil,
and Turkey are ahead of India in R&amp;amp;D spending and seven countries in the
world spend 3% or more of GDP on R&amp;amp;D, scientists point out.

While the academicians indicate that support for education presents an even
more dismal picture. Currently India stands 134th in terms of the expenditure
on education as percentage of GDP. In 2012, it was 3.2%, and today it is
further down to 2.9%. Around 40 countries including developing countries like
Tunisia, Jamaica, Vietnam, Kenya and Venezuela spend more than 6% of their GDP
on education.

The petition seeks the Prime Minister to ensure an allocation of at least 10%
of GDP (PPP) for education and 3% of GDP (PPP) for scientific and
technological research in the upcoming budget. ""We also request firm
governmental steps for the streamlining of administration, eradication of
bureaucratic practices, ensuring greater academic and financial autonomy for
universities and academic institutions, and strict accountability at every
level,"" scientists said.

""The online petition to the Prime Minister is launched now and the signature
campaign will on for a month. It is to seek more allocation for science and
education in the country,"" Breakthrough Science Society (BSS) secretariat
member Rajeevan.P.P said.

""Though there was not much cut in the union budget last year for science and
technology, allocation for science as percentage of GDP at 0.85 percent is
much less in India compared to other countries. Eventually, there has to be an
increase in funding for science,"" State Science and Technology department
principal secretary and Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and
Environment (KSCSTE) executive vice president Dr Suresh Das told TOI.

Last year, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) director
general had informed all its 38 labs across the country to generate its own
funds for running the labs.

Following that, CSIR-National Institute of Interdisciplinary Science and
Technology (NIIST) director A Ajayaghosh had decided to focus on judicious
spending for research and to enhance industrial participation. ""With strict
austerity measures including energy saving and expenditure cut, could bring
down the costs incurred by 10 percent. Of the Rs 50 crore received, we had
expended Rs 45 crore,"" Ajayaghosh said, hoping that in the upcoming budget
there would be an increase in funding for science.

**Kolkata: Muslim groups hit streets against Israel PM’s visit**

Protesters burn a banner of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US
President Donald Trump in Kolkata on Thursday. (Source: AP)

Muslim groups in the state on Thursday hit the streets of Kolkata, protesting
against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to India. Protesters
chanted slogans against Netanyahu and Modi, sprinkled ink on posters of
Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump and later burned their posters. The
protest meeting was held near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Maidan.

Protesters said while the Israeli government is terrorising Muslims in
Palestine, India is welcoming their prime minister. “Muslims in Palestine are
being attacked, their lands and property being encroached upon. It is sad to
see Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcoming Netanyahu with open arms,” said Md
Kamruzzaman, general secretary, All Bengal Minority Youth Federation.

The general secretary was referring to the ongoing conflict between Israel and
Palestine over East Jerusalem, with both nations insisting the city is their
capital. US President Donald Trump had in December 2017 officially recognised
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, provoking condemnation from Palestinian
leaders, Muslim countries and the global community at large.

Kamruzzaman also said Netanyahu’s visit to Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram at
Sabarmati in Ahmedabad was unfortunate.

“Gandhiji never approved of Israel’s policies. Why has Modi brought him to
Sabarmati? The pious place has been insulted,” he added. Kamruzzaman also
demanded that India should sever all business ties with Israel and appreciated
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for “not allowing” Netanyahu in the state.

“We welcome the role played by Mamata because people like Netanyahu, while he
is welcomed to places like UP and Gujarat, is not allowed in Bengal,” he said.

**GST Council rejigs rates of 29 items, 53 services** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India announced a significant revamp of the goods and services tax
(GST) framework, including cuts in the rates on 20-litre packaged drinking
water, biodiesel, diamonds and precious stones, sugar candies, tailoring
services, amusement parks and low-cost housing construction services. The
total revenue loss on account of these cuts, which take effect on January 25,
is pegged at Rs 1,000-1,200 crore.  
  
The GST Council, the apex decision-making body for the tax, approved a rejig
in the rates of 29 goods and changes to the taxation regime for 53 services at
its 25th meeting in the Capital on Thursday. The council is also veering
toward a simpler compliance regime for businesses that will entail a single
form or even just a supply invoice. It approved a definition for handicrafts
and the designation of 40 items as handicrafts.  
  
""One key issue before the council was simplification of the return process,""
union finance minister and council chairman Arun Jaitley said. ""Initially,
there will be a GSTR3B and a supplier's invoice... Today it was discussed but
not approved but we are moving in that direction.""  
  
The council felt that the ministerial group set up under Bihar deputy chief
minister Sushil Modi for return simplification and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys,
which has built the GST Network, can finalise the format of the return form.
It can then be taken up over video conference and approved, Jaitley said.
Modi, GSTN chairman Ajay Bhushan Pandey and Nilekani gave a detailed
presentation to the council in this regard. Compliance has been a major pain
point for the industry that has raised the issue of complexity, the number and
frequency of returns as well as the functioning of the GST Network, which
hasn't been without its glitches.  
  
The plan, which is still in the works, seeks to do away with three forms —
GSTR1, GSTR2 and GSTR3 — and replace them with GSTR3B initially along with the
uploading of a supply invoice. An official said this may be further simplified
with just the supply invoice having to be uploaded and the filing of a return
annually or whatever frequency is decided upon. Taxes can be deposited on the
basis of the invoice and if there is any mismatch between the buyer and seller
invoices, an explanation can be sought.  
  
**Here's the full list of revised GST rates on 29 goods and 53 services:**   
**Items** |  **Old tax rate** |  **New tax rate**  
---|---|---  
**Second-hand medium and large cars and SUVs** | 28% | 18%  
**LPG supply for supply to household domestic consumers by private LPG distributors** | 18% | 5%  
**Bio-fuels powered buses** | 28% | 18%  
**Sugar boiled confectionery** | 18% | 12%  
**Drinking water packed in 20 litre bottles** | 18% | 12%  
**Drip Irrigation system** | 18% | 12%  
**Cigarette filter rods** | 12% | 18%  
**Tailoring service** | 18% | 5%  
**The admission to theme parks, water parks etc** | 28% |  18%   
  
** Composition Scheme Discussed   
**

The council gave in-principle approval to changes suggested to the GST law and
rules, including an enabling provision for centralised registration and
filing. ""After final drafting and legislative clearance, they will be brought
in as amendment,"" a government official said.

""Consensus on simplification of the return process by continuing with Form 3B
and uploading of only supplier invoice details is good news for the industry,""
said Harpreet Singh, partner, indirect tax, KPMG India. ""It simply means
lesser and easier compliances and resultant less compliance costs.""

Pratik Jain, indirect tax leader, PwC, said, ""While simplification and merging
multiple monthly returns into a single return would be good in concept, it
needs to be ensured that invoice level details are made available to the
buyers on a real-time basis so that remedial action can be taken without
waiting for assessment or audit.""

Jaitley said the composition scheme was discussed by the council as total
collections from 7 million dealers amounted to Rs 307 crore, implying that
most have declared turnover below Rs 20 lakh. He said that one of the
suggestions from the council to address evasion was reintroduction of the
reverse-charge mechanism for composition dealers. ""This could be considered
when amendments to the central GST and state GST laws are taken up,"" the
minister said. The composition scheme is aimed at small businesses below a
revenue threshold that can pay a flat rate and avoid GST documentation.

The council had at its meeting in November raised the threshold for availing
the composition scheme to Rs 1.5 crore.

Jaitley said the council approved a new definition for handicrafts as
recommended by a committee and the categorisation of 40 items under it.

""These would now be examined by the fitment committee,"" he said. Also, the
committee on handicrafts will examine requests from states for inclusion of
more items in the category. However, an official said the fitment committee
may not suggest reduction in tax rates for all handicraft goods.

""The principal concern is jobs in the handicraft sector,"" Jaitley said.

The council also reviewed the integrated GST collections of about Rs 35,000
crore with the Centre and it was decided that this can be provisionally
divided between the Centre and the states.

""This will ease the indirect tax collection of state and Centre. Direct tax
collections have been good and we will meet the budgeted target,"" Jaitley
said.

Asked about Hindustan Unilever's offer to deposit Rs 119 crore with the anti-
profiteering authority, he said this amount would be provisionally accepted.
This follows the government seeking to ensure that companies are passing on
the benefits of lower GST to consumers.

On the Congress party's demand for imposition of GST on petroleum products and
inclusion of real estate within GST's ambit, he said these issues would be
discussed at the next meeting.

Following the electronicway bill trial having started on January 15, this will
be rolled out nationwide from February 1 for inter-state sales while 15 states
will implement it for intra-state trade. ""Trade and transport are expected to
comply with the e-way bill,"" he said.

ET had reported on January 17 that businesses are worried about being prepared
for the e-way bill rollout with some calling for a deferral.

**Modi ‘best doctor’ to cure India of major ‘diseases’: Union minister Arjun Meghwal** 

 ______ 
Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi
may not have an MBBS degree but he certainly is the “best doctor” to treat the
illnesses that plague the country.

The Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga
Rejuvenation made the remarks during the ongoing MRAI International Indian
Metals Recycling Conference here.

“There were some other countries too which got Independence from the British
rule in 1947. India, however, did not see the growth rate as it should have
and that was because of six major diseases.

“No doubt, there has been development, but not at the speed which was desired
of it,” he told the conference.

Meghwal said cleanliness, corruption, poverty, communalism, casteism and
terrorism are the six diseases, identified by the prime minister, that gripped
the country and are responsible for its slow pace of growth.

“Modi ji has resolved to ensure the desired pace of growth for India,” Meghwal
said, adding that “Modiji is not an MBBS doctor but whatever diseases have
gripped the country, he is the best doctor to treat them.”

He has kept cleanliness on the top, this itself shows that the Prime Minister
is concerned about the industry, Meghwal told the members of Metals Recycling
Association of India (MRAI).

Meghwal asserted that “Mera Desh Badal Raha hai, Aage badh raha hai” (My
country is changing, progressing) is not just a slogan but a reality about the
transformation of the country.

He said visitors coming to India 3-4 years ago used to see a lot of garbage
along the beaches, but today the situation has improved, “The slogan has
changed the mindset of the people and today citizens are more conscious
cleanliness.”

MRAI President Sanjay Mehta requested for a policy for the metals recycling
industry and removal of basic customs duty on imports of scrap.

“Introducing policy (for metal recycling industry) in India is very much
needed. Initially, I am sure government will not put stringent norms and
standards on recycling of scrap, but as we are a developing country, we expect
the government to implement norms and standards at par with that existing in
developed countries like the US, the UK and Europe, gradually,” he said.

Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap trade is being hit in India as “at present GST
on scrap trade is 18 per cent on all grades of metal scrap”, he added.

The industry expressed hope that the government will take concrete steps to
boost the recycling industry by removing 2.5 per cent customs duty on import
of various grades of metal scrap in the upcoming Budget.

**Padmaavat 'bakwas', don't watch it, Asaduddin Owaisi tells Muslims** 

 ______ 
HYDERABAD: Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) president and Hyderabad MP

Asaduddin Owaisi

has described the controversial Hindi film Padmaavat as 'bakwas' (waste) and
urged Muslims not to watch the film that revolves around legendary Rajput
queen

Rani Padmavati

and emperor Alauddin Khilji.

Addressing a public meeting in Warangal city late on Wednesday night as part
of the all-India campaign on 'Save Sharia', Owaisi called on Muslims,
particularly the youth, not to watch Padmaavat and waste their time and money.
""The film is a bakwas. Do not waste your time by watching the film. It
incidentally is based on a story written by a Muslim writer,"" Owaisi said.

Asaduddin Owaisi said Padmaavat is a 'manhoos' (curse-ridden) and 'ghaleez'
(bad) film. ""Do not run after it. Do not watch it. God has not created you to
watch this two-hour film. God created you to lead a good life and do good
things that should be remembered for centuries,"" he said.

#### SC lifts bans, clears release of Padmaavat

The bench led by CJI Dipak Misra reminded the governments of their
constitutional obligation to protect right to free speech and expression by
controlling law and order problems that could arise because of opposition to
screening of the film by fringe groups.

Owaisi said Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

had set up a 12-member panel to review the 'bakwas' film and suggest cuts. The
story written by poet Malik Mohammad Jayasi in 1540 is a fiction and has no
historical basis, but still the government has shown so much interest on the
movie based on a fiction.

""But when it comes to the Muslim law (triple talaq issue), the Prime Minister
did not bother to consult Muslim leaders,"" he said.

The MIM leader also asked Muslims to learn from the Rajputs who are standing
in support of their queen. ""They are showing a mirror to us. They have stood
united on the issue and they do not want the movie to be screened. But Muslims
are divided. They do not raise their voice when attempts are made to change
the Islamic law,"" he said.

Referring to VHP leader Pravin Togadia's issue, Owaisi criticised the

Congress

for its double standards in visiting him at a Gujarat hospital. Coming down
heavily on Togadia for his anti-Muslim and anit-Islam talks, he wondered how
the Congress can support such a person.

Owaisi has been touring

Telangana

and holding meetings as part of the Save Sharia campaign. Thousands of people
turned up on Wednesday at the meeting held to mobilise people against any
amendments in the Muslim personal law.

**Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged the nation to not judge him only
on the basis of his decisions to implement demonetisation and GST. “Don’t
evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, we brought economic reform, built
toilets, brought electricity to 18000 villages,” PM Modi said in an exclusive
interview with Zee News.

Talking about his global approach, the Prime Minister who recently hosted his
Israeli counterpart in New Delhi and Gujarat said, “They said my understanding
was limited to Gujarat. I made it my strength. I did not follow protocol, I
was a simple man with no baggage. I made friends the world over.”

On the upcoming World Economic Forum, Modi said that the world wants to hear
“directly from the Horse’s mouth.” The PM also talked about India’s policies
and growth potential and expressed that he felt proud to represent India in
Davos.

Stating that the Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, PM Modi said the
Davos meet is a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with
the strength of demographic dividend. “The country is seeing the biggest jump
in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is natural that the world wants to talk
directly to India and the world wants to hear directly from the horse’s mouth
about India’s policies and potential. It matters if you hear it from the
leader,” he added.

Meanwhile, Modi also stressed on his push for conducting simultaneous polls
for Lok Sabha and state assemblies and said that like festivals it should be
held on fixed schedule.

Proofs, there was so much corruption in real life, leave the big-shots corruptions, but during UPA, the experience of renewing a passport, registering a new car, i.e., the work that required visiting a public office was awful, nothing would happen without passing a note between the books, but now, this has stopped, as BJP has made many things online, removing a middle man, thus speeding things.

I would like to say that modi is good as, he passed GST, even though he knew it will eat his voteshare, he doesn't have the lust to be in power, his goal is to make the nation better, rather than just do something to woo voters.

I recommend you to watch Republic TV, it seems that they only broadcasts real news, being a non-Lutyens media, many will argue arnab slaughters all the anti-bjp, but it is not true, he always supports what is right, and now days bjp is doing everything right, like why did RaGa support tukde tukde gang, someone will say that bjp attacked freedom of speech, but they didnt act like a reasonable indians, afzal guru who killed so many people, how can a indian support him.

And then the dalit riots, they too were called by jignesh mewani, they damaged me and my family, there was so much destruction.

They call bjp as anti minority, but dont get the fact that how can they target minority, our PM himself is OBC and the president is Backward class, but the top leaders of congress are elites ( atleast come under general class)

Another thing is jignesh mewani calling Mr. Modi, go to himalayas and shed your bones and RaGa supporting him, this is not the way our youth should treat a elder, even though modi is from opposition party, there should always be respect for elders, and especially for such able like Mr. Modi, this is what indian culture teaches.

353,"I almost stopped reading your long post when you mentioned Republic TV. Owner of Republic TV is Rajeev Chandrashekhar who is a BJP MP if you dont know. Arnab Goswami who is son of Manoranjan Goswami who was a BJP MLA(or MP i dont know).
Secondly, you mentioned that Modi has no lust for power. LMAO. Modi is always in election mode for what I know. 10 days after Gujarat results he held election rally. Last week, he held election Rally in Rajasthan for Bypolls where senior leaders of Congress did not even wander. He held election Rallies in Maharashtra during Municipal polls too if I am not wrong. This shows that he only has lust for power and is not interested in nation. He wants to spread RSS wings and wants control over India.(Please read about the rise of Mussolini and see if you can spot similarities)
About, Tukde Tukde gang, I know this comes from filthy republic TV but if you are interested, please watch any interview of Kanhaiyya Kumar and Umar Khalid(I recommend the one with Kunal Kamra) to know their position about affairs. I am not a left winger like them but their clarity of thought is just amazing.
About GST, you seem to be brainwashed again. UPA1 introduced GST in 2005 which was opposed by BJP for next 9 years of their rule. Please read the provisions of GST bill of Congress and the method of Implementation. Also read the provisions of GST from BJP. I am pretty sure after reading that I am convinced that the current government has no clue about GST implementation.
As for Dalit riots. I come from Pune, Maharashtra. If you dont know, the perpetrators are Manohar Bhide and Milind Ekbote(he was a corporator from my adjacent ward). These 2 guys come from RSS. They were the ones who attacked the marchers first. The march from Shaniwar Wada to Bhima Koregaon was already declared 15 days before the ceromony. This march happens every year if you dont know. The main intention of the attackers was to break the Maratha-Dalit unity. That is why Mr. Manohar Bhide changed his name to Sambhaji Bhide for the purpose of attack.
Mr. Jignesh Mewani calling Modi doesnt surprise me. Modi is much more crass that the comments made by Mr. Mewani. I dont support Mewani's politics personally(because he used Dalit atrocities for political gains) but he gave Modi what Modi gave to the world. Again, If you dont recall, He had called Mrs. Sonia Gandhi Jersey Cow, Mr. Shashi Tharoor as 50 Crore ki Girlfriend, Mr. Manmohan Singh as wearing raincoat in the bathroom.

You have a very bad view of Mr. Modi, this is same position i was few years back, the media is to be held responsible.

Today, I hold media(like the repub-lick channel you follow) for creating blind bhakts like you. Go out and see the reality.

About giving examples,I know of atleast 2 families that have changed their views regarding Modi. They are pretty confident that current situation is not good for the country. They were very strong Modi supporters for 2014 elections.

Also, you seem to be very adamant on proving Republic TV right. If you know current situation in Maharashtra, BJP(and Shiv Sena) alliance cannot win more than 28 seats(This is my bhakt friend calculation). According to my analysis, BJP will be wiped out of Rural constituencies in Maharashtra. Your favorite channel has given them 44. See the situation out there and then comment.
Also, regarding discipline, i admire discipline of RSS people too. But the amount of brainwash that goes on Shakhas is just pukeworthy. Even Pakistan/China army is disciplined and that doesnt mean I should support them, right?

Please tell me how calling Mrs. Gandhi as Jersey Cow support your argument regarding Jignesh Mewani? He used much better language than the third class fellow that we have as PM.

Yes, I know how you like to think yourself as some kind of ""expert"" on this subject but my past discussion with you don't support it. You just spout, and sometimes incorrectly, common knowledge that can be easily researched and when you cannot support your arguments indulge in troll like behaviour. Like this:

&gt; No, only the ballistic missile program did

Really? So no part of Project Devil and Valiant found its way into other missiles? /s

&gt; ... that ""another missile"" you speak of was never assembled in India under ""ToT"".

So who was taking about that in the context of transfer of ToT? You asked how buying technology in the past without ToT has helped us and I pointed out that it helps us because we can reverse engineer it. The problem with reverse engineering is that it takes time and sometimes we just fail. We've been trying to reverse engineer the cryogenic engine for some time now. ToT helps us reduce the time to master a technology.

And that is why the Indian National Congress, with its long experience with such kind of projects knows how joint development &amp; ToT can speed up our R&amp;D and that's why opted for such. It helps that we have become world leaders in rocket, missile and nuclear science that others are now willing to consider ToT when doing business with us.

Modi has set us back in this area - by insisting on ToT clauses (where we could get away with it), the Congress government was sending a message to foreign governments that India would buy technology only under such conditions or they could opt to partner with India and jointly develop such technology with us. Now everyone knows Modi is a fool who can be taken for a ride ... ",2018-01-20 04:41:12

**""I'm A Common Man, Don't Know Protocols,"" Says PM Modi On ""Hugplomacy""** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi said his basic nature has been ""to convert adversity into
opportunity"".

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi when asked about his trademark hugs on Friday
said he was unaware of laid down protocols as he is a common man and this has
become his strength, as his openness was liked by the world leaders.

PM Modi also said his basic nature has been ""to convert adversity into
opportunity"".

Days after being mocked by the Congress over his hugs, PM Modi said in a TV
interview had he been ""trained"", he too would have followed the laid down
protocols of shaking hands and ""looking left and right"" with world leaders.

""I do not know all the protocols as I am a common man. The openness of this
common man is liked by the world. Friendly relations come in handy,"" he said
in the interview to Zee news.

He further said, ""Had I been trained like others...I too would have followed
those protocols of looking right and left, had shaken hands. But I am an
ordinary person...I only try to ensure that no harm ever happens to my country
(due to this),"" A few days ago, the Congress had posted a tweet mocking Modi
for hugging world leaders, evoking a sharp reaction from the BJP that slammed
it as ""immature"" and demanded an apology.

""When I became the prime minister, there was criticism that Modi neither knows
nor understands anything which is outside Gujarat...,"" PM Modi said.

__ Comments

""Everybody used to ask me how will I conduct my foreign policy. And in a way,
this criticism was right because I did not have any experience. I got the
benefit of not having experience. I did not have any baggage,"" he said.

Asked how he feels when he stands next to world leaders, he said, ""My only
feeling is that it is not Narendra Modi who is standing there but the
representative of 1.25 billion people.""

- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive

- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.

- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.

- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation

- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.

- furthering HIndutva  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.

- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.",2018-01-20 13:28:43

**Modi government has bad news for Indians dreaming of easy money via bitcoins** 

 ______ 
Bitcoin, the

cryptocurrency

that has become the craze all over the world, is a hit with a lot of Indians
too. More than $3.5 billion worth of transactions in the cryptocurrency have
been conducted in India over a 17-month period, according to the income tax
department. Bitcoin has the allure of any

Ponzi scheme

with a get-rich-quick promise. Additionally, it can be a new opportunity for
hoarders of

black money

.

The profiles of common investors in Bitcoin prove this. They are tech-savvy
young investors, real estate players and jewellers, tax officials told
Reuters.

But the government won't let Bitcoin trap the honest investors or help the
black-money industry. While governments across world are not sure what to do
with Bitcoin, the Indian government has swiftly acted to rein in Bitcoin and
other such currencies. The income tax department has sent tax notices to tens
of thousands of people dealing in cryptocurrency. The notices were sent after
a survey assessed the penetration and patterns of virtual currency trade. The
tax department is not going to wait until a final decision is taken on the
legality of cryptocurrencies.

Last month, the Income Tax (IT) department planned to send notices to 4 to 5
lakh high networth individuals (HNI) across the country who were trading on
the exchanges of this unregulated virtual currency, the PTI reported. The move
came after the IT department conducted survey operations at major bitcoin
exchanges across the country on suspicion of alleged tax evasion. These
operations were undertaken for gathering evidence for establishing the
identity of investors and traders, the transaction undertaken by them,
identity of counter-parties and related bank accounts.

Top lenders including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank
and Yes Bank have suspended some accounts of major Bitcoin exchanges in India,
suspecting dubious transactions, an ET report said citing sources. The banks
have also sought additional collateral from the promoters of these exchanges
on their borrowings and have capped cash withdrawals from the few accounts
that are still operational. The accounts of a few exchanges were frozen after
banks discovered they were used for reasons other than those stated when they
were opened. At least eight accounts in various banks have been suspended,
while others are being scrutinised and have had cash withdrawal limits
imposed. Even the operational accounts could be suspended in the coming weeks.

In addition to financial risks—the value of

bitcoins

has seen huge fluctuation—the regulators are worried about their use for
illicit and illegal activities, subjecting the users to an unintentional
breach of laws against money laundering and terror finance. Concerns also
emanate from some unscrupulous entities indulging in illicit money-pooling
activities—commonly known as ponzi schemes—with the promise of huge returns
from investment in bitcoins and other variants, which they claim are minted
through blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that was created to mint
bitcoins and comprises of extremely complex algorithms with several thousand
nodes for each chain.

There is a suspicion that some so-called cryptocurrencies and bitcoin
investments may actually have nothing to do with any blockchain-developed
virtual currency and are just new ways devised by scamsters to ride the wave
and what they may be offering could be 'e-ponzi' schemes. The financial
regulators are worried that a complete lack of regulatory regime for such
cryptocurrencies may give rise to 'e-ponzi' schemes.

The financial sector watchdogs, including RBI and Sebi, as also various
government agencies, will get into a huddle to prepare a framework to
safeguard the gullible investors and to clamp down on the fraudsters who may
try to manipulate the regulatory gaps, according to a PTI report. There are
quite a few proposals on the table. These include applying to cryptocurrencies
the existing regulations aimed at checking the spread of ponzi schemes or
illicit money-pooling activities, money laundering and black money generation
and circulation.

**Appeal To President To Hear Us, Says AAP In Office Of Profit Case** 

 ______ 
""There was no hearing, we were not given a chance to explain our stand"" Manish
Sisodia said this evening

**New Delhi: **Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party

on Saturday described the Election Commission's recommendation

to disqualify 20 AAP lawmakers

""unconstitutional"" and decided to ask President Ram Nath Kovind to hear them
out before signing the formal orders.

This week, the Election Commission had asked President to disqualify the 20
lawmakers for violating office of profit provisions.

""We are seeking time to meet the President. The legislators will meet him and
present

evidence to support their case

,"" Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced after the 20 legislators set
to lose their seat met his

boss, Arvind Kejriwal.

Should Rashtrapati Bhavan oblige the Aam Aadmi Party with an appointment, it
is going to be a meeting high on optics, not substance, and would underline
AAP's determination to fight the recommendation at all levels. Rashtrapati
Bhavan does not have a discretion and the law requires the President to act on
the commission's advice.

Mr Sisodia said the Election Commission's recommendation was ""unconstitutional
and undemocratic"" because the legislators were not given an opportunity to
defend the charge that they had violated the office of profit provisions. This
is also against the principles of natural justice, he said.

Lawmakers, under the office of profit provisions, cannot hold any post in the
government that entitles them to perks or powers unless a law has been passed
to exempt the posts. If someone complains and the Election Commission finds
that a particular office held by a legislator qualifies to be an office of
profit, the lawmakers stand to lose their seats.

In 2015, someone did complain when Chief Minister Kejriwal appointed 21
lawmakers as parliamentary secretaries after the AAP swept the elections with
a crushing majority, capturing 67 of the 70 seats. The idea was to involve
legislators in running the government and flew in the face of the principle of
separation of powers between the executive and legislature.

Later when the AAP government attempted to duck the office of profit
provisions by enacting a law to exempt these posts, the BJP-ruled central
government spiked the bill.

The AAP government reasons that this rejection was blatantly unfair and
inspired by politics, not the Constitution, because many other states
including Delhi had in the past made such exemptions.

In 2006, the Congress government-led by Sheila Dikshit had also pushed a
similar law through the assembly. ""How could the centre clear that bill but
reject the one sent by the AAP government,"" asked Delhi Minister Gopal Rai.

""Despite one nation and one constitution... Delhi is being treated
differently... is this not sabotage?"" Mr Rai asked.

__ Comments

The party has also renewed its attack on Chief Election Commissioner AK Joti,
who the party alleges, had a personal stake in the disqualification of the
legislators just days before he was to demit office on turning 65. Mr Rai
called the recommendation the bureaucrat's ""parting gift to PM Modi"". Mr Joti,
who retires on Tuesday, was earlier a key aide of Mr Modi when he was the
Gujarat Chief Minister.

""This is not a game,"" he said, declaring that the party would exhaust every
legal and constitutional avenue. A petition filed by six AAP lawmakers is
slated to come up for hearing on Monday.

415,"**One Nation, One Election is a** ***jumla*** that has been exposed many times here. Here are the real reasons why Modi and the BJP want it:

1. BJP politics is heavily based on money-power. Fighting one election is cheaper for them than for the other political parties who do not rely as much on media manipulations and media marketing as the BJP and Modi do.

2. Having only one state and central elections every 5 years is only possible if we have a **fixed-term** for government. **This is how Modi plans to convert our democracy to banana republic under his dictatorship.** A fixed-term for a government would mean any party or alliance that forms the government first, and anyone who becomes the CM or PM, can remain in power for the full term **even if they lose majority in the assembly or parliament**. This takes away the right of the opposition to hod a government accountable for its failures.

3. The current feature of our democracy are part of the [basic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_structure_doctrine) of our constitution. Point 2 violates it and thus this whole *jumla* can never really survive constitutionally unless Modi first stuffs our judiciary with RSS judges.

4. The whole theory behind this *jumla* is that it has been observed that when some state election falls near any parliament elections, the one who wins the parliament election also generally wins the state elections. Thus, Modi and the BJP hope to come to power at state and central at one go. **Modi wants this badly as they can only change the constitution of india if they have an absolute  majority** - in the *Lok Sabha*, the *Rajya Sabha*, and in many states.",2018-01-21 04:12:49
416,"The cartoon tries to spin the BJP propaganda that Congress has never supported relations with Israel so as to not anger the ""Indian Muslims"". Facts of course don't bear this: 

- India has always supported Israel as a country while opposing some of its policies that harm others. 

- It has never shied away from having a diplomatic relation with it.
- Israel was a tiny country with no real powers for a long time. 
- India depends heavily on the Arabs for its oil.
- The Arab countries had more diplomatic influence than Israel then.
- Thus, it made no sense for India to jeopardise its relation with the Arabs for a country that had nothing to offer India. 
- The Arab states have weakened.
- India has also grown in power. 

- Though still heavily depended on the Arabs for oil, we now also have multiple sources of oil (Nigeria, Venezuela, Russia, US etc).

- It is only in the recent decades that Israel has progressed economically and technologically.

- Thus it now makes sense to have a deeper relation with Israel as they can hep us with our defence needs. 

- Indian Muslims don't care a shit about Israel or Palestine

- *Sanghis* actually care a lot more about the Israelis than Indian Muslims as they believe Jews hate Muslims as much as they do, and that Jews are similar to Hindus in that both their religion do not have ""conversions"" (that's not factua as you can become a Hindu or a Jew). 

- Thus the *Sanghis* and Modi included actually give too much importance to Israel than what it is required for such a small country, while the congress treats them as any other small country.

**WEF Davos 2018: Narendra Modi to apprise world leaders of reforms, investment readiness**

In addition to the keynote address, PM Modi will also have bilateral meeting
with Swiss President Alain Berset at WEF, Davos. Photo: Reuters

**New Delhi:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi will impress upon world leaders at World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos next week that India is an open economy and ready for global investments across sectors, top government officials said on Friday. 

Announcing details of Modi’s visit to the Swiss resort for WEF, secretary
(economic relations) in the external affairs ministry, Vijay Gokhale said, “it
will be a 24 hour visit but a very focused one”. In the first visit by an
Indian Prime Minister since 1997, Modi will be in Davos on 22-23 January, and
address the opening plenary of the WEF.

“Our economy has expanded significantly since the last time an Indian prime
minister went to Davos and therefore this visit is very important,” Gokhale
said. “In addition to the keynote address, Modi will also have bilateral
meeting with Swiss President Alain Berset. Besides, there will be scope for
pull asides, details of which are being worked out,” he said.

This will be a very significant visit and will give a message about our
engagements with the world, he said. The focus will be on prime minister’s
vision about India’s economy’s at the domestic as well as global level.
Talking about the business engagements of Indian leaders in Davos, Ramesh
Abhishek, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP),
said that PM will also host a round table dinner on 22 January for 60 top
chief executive officers (CEOs) including 40 from global corporates and 20
from India.

They will include CEOs of Airbus, Hitachi, BAE Systems and IBM. Modi will also
have an interaction with 120 members of the investor community at WEF on 23
January which will include heads of General Motors, Salesforce and Royal Dutch
Shell, Nestle and JP Morgan.

Abhishek said DIPP will also host a welcome reception for the WEF members,
where 1,500 people are expected. “We will showcase India’s progress while also
giving a taste of Indian cuisine as well as of Indian culture and heritage,”
he said. Besides PM, there will be six union ministers including Arun Jaitley
who will address three sessions on 24 January.

Suresh Parbhu will have nine sessions over three days, Dharmendra Pradhan will
have five sessions, Piyush Goyal (10), Jitendra Singh (3) and M.J. Akbar (2).
There will also be a large number of round tables including on financial
inclusion in India. Abhishek said the reforms that have been taken in the last
few years will be showcased in Davos.

“The central message the prime minister will give is that India is open and
ready to do business in a big way. We want to tell the world to come and
invest in India,” Gokhale said. “PM’s message will be about India being an
economy that can be engine of global growth. We want others to participate in
our growth and want to participate in others’ growth as well,” he added.

When asked why PM has chosen to go Davos this year, Gokhale said: “My sense is
that PM wanted things to change on the ground before speaking about them. We
have already opened our economy and it is no more the case that we are going
to do it.”

The five-day WEF annual meeting 2018 beginning on 22 January will be attended
by 70 state heads. Besides, 38 heads of major international organisations such
as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank, as also nearly 2,000 CEOs will be present.

The theme of the meeting, spread over 400 sessions, would be on creating a
shared future in a fractured world. The meeting will also see the largest ever
proportion of women leaders (21%), with all co-chairs being women this time,
including social entrepreneur Chetna Sinha from India and IMF chief Christine
Lagarde.

**Biggest 'sell-off' gets Rs 37,000 crore for govt** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Almost a year after the idea of creating a truly integrated oil
behemoth by merging state-run giants was conceived in the budget, flagship
explorer

ONGC

on Saturday said it will acquire the government's holding in the country's
third-largest refiner-marketer

Hindustan Petroleum

for nearly Rs 37,000 crore to complete the first consolidation exercise in the
public sector energy space.

The ""strategic sale"" will see ONGC pay Rs 36,915 crore in cash for the
government's over 51% stake in HPCL. This works out to 473.97 a share, which
is a premium of 14% over Friday's closing price of the

HPCL

scrip. It is also ""reasonably higher"" than the government's own valuation.

Based on Friday's closing price of 416.55, HPCL has a market capitalisation of
about Rs 63,475 crore. At this price, the government's stake is worth Rs
32,442 crore. ONGC has been exempted from making an open offer as the
government is the owner of both the companies.

The transaction, to be completed by the end of this month, will help the
Centre cross its disinvestment target by over Rs 20,000 crore and end the year
with a record Rs 90,000 crore sell-off proceeds.

With 10 weeks to go for the fiscal year to close, the deal will considerably
ease the pressure on government finances and help the Centre close the year
with a fiscal deficit which is not far from the budgeted level of 3.2% of GDP,
sources said.

But at the same time, officials said the transaction should not be seen
through the fiscal prism as it comes with several synergies for both the
public sector companies in addition to the possibility of merger of ONGC
subsidiaries such as MRPL with HPCL in future. It will help HPCL directly
source nearly two-thirds of its crude requirement from ONGC besides making
them integrated energy players.

After ONGC told the oil ministry of its decision to acquire HPCL, the
government had started off talks by seeking about 1 lakh crore on ground that
an open sale would fetch no less. ONGC's own valuation advisor E&amp;amp;Y had put
HPCL's valuation at Rs 475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling
stake. The 'outside' advise that ONGC sought from Citi put the price at Rs 500
per share.

ONGC is expected to go for short-term borrowings to fund the acquisition. It
also has cash reserves of about Rs 12,000 crore. Sources said ONGC has already
taken board approval for raising the borrowing limit to Rs 35,000 crore from
Rs 25,000 crore. The company can also draw upon loan commitments from domestic
and foreign lenders aggregating nearly double the HPCL acquisition price for
making the payment.

Announcing the deal in a tweet on Saturday, the finance ministry provided a
perspective to the merger by pointing out a February 2016 review meeting where
Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""underlined the need of efficient management of
government investments in central public sector enterprises (CPSEs)"".

The government accordingly expanded the approach from of disinvestment to
investment and public asset management.

""Accordingly, as part of investment management strategy, the Government of
India decided to explore possibilities of consolidation, mergers and
acquisitions within CPSE space. An announcement in this regard was also made
by the finance minister in his Budget speech of 2017-18,"" it said.

The Cabinet had on July 19 last year, given an 'in-principle' approval to the
said proposal and decided to set up an alternative mechanism under the finance
minister to decide on the price, timing and the terms and conditions of the
strategic sale.

The acquisition will give ONGC, which accounts for 70% of India's domestic oil
production, a substantial presence in refining and retail space with HPCL's
15,000 outlets. The company is expected to continue with the HPCL brand in
retail and lubes. With a turnover of Rs 2,13,489 crore and profit of Rs 6,502
crore during 2016-17, HPCL ranks at 384th position in Fortune Global 500 and
48th place in Platts 250 Global Energy Companies. HPCL markets around 35.2
million tonnes of petroleum products with a market share of about 21% and is
the number one lube marketer in the country. It has refineries at Mumbai and
Visakhapatnam and a joint venture refinery at Bhatinda.

HPCL also owns the biggest lubricant refinery in India and the second-largest
cross-country product pipeline network of about 3,500 km. HPCL has a vast
marketing network spread across the length and breadth of the country with
terminals, depots, LPG bottling plants, lube blending plants, aviation fuel
stations and around 15,000 petrol pumps.

**Narendra Modi bats for simultaneous elections**

All political parties should come together to support simultaneous elections
in India as a lot of financial and human resources get used due to frequent
elections, said PM Narendra Modi in an interview to Zee News. Photo: PTI

**New Delhi:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that all political parties should come together to support simultaneous elections in India as a lot of financial and human resources get used due to frequent elections.

Modi said that simultaneous elections are possible if all political parties
work together because no political party or government alone can be successful
in holding simultaneous polls both at the national and state level.

“All political parties should come together on simultaneous polls, let there
be a nationwide debate on simultaneous polls. I am confident that if there is
discussion in the country, something good will come out. Apart from spending
huge amount of financial and human resources in conducting elections, the
security forces and police find it difficult to serve the people because they
are busy in election duties,” Modi said in an interview to Zee News.

Modi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance
(NDA) government had helped 100 million people start their own business
through the Mudra Yojana, under which a total amount of Rs4 trillion was given
to people for the purpose.

Modi said that 7 million new EPF (Employees’ Provident Fund) accounts have
been opened in the past one year. “The government is working in the right
direction. Is it not job creation when 10 crore people get money to start
their own business? Out of the 10 crore people, 3 crore people got money from
the bank for the first time, is it not job creation?” Modi asked.

During the course of the interview, when Modi was asked about the focus of the
upcoming Union Budget, he said that development is the only message of the NDA
and that the government would take all possible steps to ensure that the
fruits of development reach everyone. “Development, development and
development is the only message of the Union government. We are working with
the motive of development for all,” said Modi.

On the performance of the BJP-led government at the centre in the last three
years, Modi said some of its biggest achievements were the Jan Dhan Yojana
(opening bank accounts), toilets in schools, 33 million families getting
cooking gas cylinders, electrification of 18,000 villages, people being
provided insurance in 90 paise and distribution and installation of LED
lights.

“The implementation of goods and services tax succeeded because of the federal
structure of the country and NDA honours the spirit of federal structure. It
is a huge transformation and some adjustments would take time. Government
should work for the people, not to win elections,” said Modi.

**View: Why only Haj? End subsidies for all pilgrims** 

 ______ 
I welcome the abolition of the government

subsidy

for Haj

pilgrims

. The

Constitution

says the Indian state is secular, and forbids discrimination on religious
grounds. So, the state should keep its distance from all religious groups, and
not subsidise any.

The

Haj

subsidy was always a violation of this principle. No wonder the Supreme Court
ruled in 2012 that it should be phased out. The BJP has long called the
subsidy a case of ""minority appeasement"". The

Modi government

has now decided to abolish it outright.

However, a secular state that bans Haj

subsidies

should surely ban subsidies for any pilgrims of any religion. Such a non-
discriminatory ban would represent secular non-appeasement.

Instead the Modi government itself last year launched the Punyadham Yatra
scheme, subsidising transport and accommodation for pilgrims to Puri,
Vrindavan, Ajmer Sharif, Mathura and Vaishno Devi. With what face can Modi
abolish one pilgrim subsidy (calling it appeasement), but create others
(without calling them appeasement too)?

Modi supporters may point out that the list includes a Muslim destination,
Ajmer Sharif. So what? Appeasing multiple religious groups is as wrong as
subsidising one. Favouring some destinations over others is also
discriminatory.

The Modi government is actually a latecomer to the subsidy bandwagon. Many
state governments have been giving pilgrim subsidies for years. Madhya
Pradesh, an early leader, launched its pilgrim subsidy in 2012, aimed at
senior citizens too poor to pay income tax. One lakh seats were available
through lottery for visits to selected Hindu shrines plus Ajmer Sharif and
Velankanni Church.

The scheme was marketed as secular because it included non-Hindu destinations.
But it still left out several religions and pilgrimage centres. Why should the
state be picking and choosing among religions or pilgrimage centres? Such
selectivity necessarily entails discrimination in favour of some and against
others.

The sad fact is that Ajmer is included in the pilgrim list of several
governments not out of secular fervour but to avoid accusations of religious
discrimination that might attract court sanctions. Is Ajmer more sacred to
Muslims than Mecca? Are Muslim pilgrims to Ajmer more deserving than pilgrims
to Mecca? Not in any way. And yet the very politicians that condemn the Haj
subsidy as ""minority appeasement"" are cynical enough to include Ajmer in their
own pilgrim subsidy list.

The subsidies provided by other states are too numerous to be listed fully.
News reports say UP gives no less than Rs 1 lakh per pilgrim for Kailash
Mansarovar. In Uttarakhand, the Congress government started the Mere Buzurg
Mere Teerth scheme in 2014, which the subsequent BJP government expanded.
Gujarat has subsidised Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims since 2001, and (along with
several other states) has also been subsidising the Sindhu Yatra (to see the
Indus river in Ladakh). Both Congress and BJP governments have introduced
pilgrim subsidies in Karnataka, Assam and Rajasthan. Tamil Nadu, ruled by
neither Congress nor BJP, has subsidies for Hindu pilgrims to Mansarovar and
Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. The BJP government in Odisha subsidises
pilgrims to destinations across India.

In sum, all political parties, Congress and non-Congress, are waist-deep in
subsidies for pilgrims of several religions. The subsidies are not a specialty
of religion-based parties. They are handed out by many parties calling
themselves secular, and even by parties (like DMK and AIADMK) claiming to be
rationalist. This is cynical vote-bank politics, exactly what the Haj subsidy
was for the Congress.

Such subsidies would be struck down as violative of the Constitution in
countries like the US or France. The courts in those countries take care to
separate the state from religious activity, even though the US has a strong
Christian lobby. In India there is no principled adherence to separation of
the state and religion. Even those politicians calling themselves secular
fundamentalists have been reluctant to condemn the Haj subsidy, or state
pilgrim subsidies.

Now, many people wishing to go on pilgrimages may find it difficult to meet
the expense. But a ""teerth yatra"" is supposed to be difficult. Many
rationalists and atheists have no pilgrimage centre. A subsidy for religious
pilgrims amounts to discrimination against rationalists and atheists,
violating Constitutional guarantees of equality of faiths (yes, atheism too is
a faith).

All religions have large, formal institutions with ample coffers. Some Indian
temples and wakf boards are enormously rich. Why should these religious bodies
not be held responsible to subsidise poor pilgrims of their own community?
They already get massive tax breaks. Let these be used to help poor pilgrims.

**Modi vindicated as IIM study debunks jobless growth theory, says 15 million added to labour force yearly** 

 ______ 
The study, titled “Towards a Payroll Reporting in India”, estimated that 3.68
million jobs were generated till November of FY18, which would imply 5.5
million in the entire year. (Image: Reuters)

The Narendra Modi-led government got a big boost as a new study finds that 15
million people are being added to the labour force every year, busting the
theory that jobs are not being created in the country. The study, authored by
SBI group Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh and Pulak Ghosh, said,
“Given declining population, we estimate that on an average 25 million babies
born per year (this has been calculated after adjusting infant morality rate
from crude birth rate) has remained largely constant in the last three
decades. Out of 25 million, we expect that 15 million are added to labour
force (after conservatively assuming 40% of them voluntarily remain out of
labour force or are involved in domestic/agriculture work).”

Earlier in November, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had launched an
attack on the government asking them to quit if they’re incapable in providing
jobs. “Mehngi gas, mehnga ration, band karo khokhla bhashan, daam bandho, kaam
do, varna khali karo singhasan,” he had tweeted in November.

The study also calculated the number of jobs in enterprises from the
membership of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Employees’ State
Insurance Corporation, General Provident Fund and National Pension System
(NPS). Interestingly, the study is the first of its kind to use these kinds of
data sets.

Eartlier, former NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya, had also
recommended using this kind of database in a report submitted by task force on
employment. “Unfortunately in India, we don’t have any proper source either to
measure the total work force or the total individuals on payroll. To make an
effort in this direction, we collected primary data from three major sources,
EPFO, ESIC and NPS,” says the report.

The study, titled “Towards a Payroll Reporting in India”, estimated that 3.68
million jobs were generated till November of FY18, which would imply 5.5
million in the entire year. “Based on all estimates, payroll of 5.9 lakh (i.e.
7 million annual) generated every month in India in current fiscal,” the
report added.

Interestingly, the study has zeroed in only new contributors who were 18-25
years old, to ensure they were capturing only new employees. Further, new
employee accounts that didn’t have steady EPFO contributions were also dropped
on the grounds they may be fraud accounts. All data pertain to the formal
sector as informal sector employees don’t contribute to EPFO. In addition, the
authors say there is also considerable employment generated from other sectors
like education. In the automobiles sector alone, based on automobile sales,
they estimate this sector generated 2 million driver jobs in FY17.

The authors have also provided various suggestions to the government,
reproduced below.

It should be mandatory for the professional bodies, hospitals, nursing homes
etc. to submit the details of new joinees every 3 month to the local
Government offices.

From April 1, 2018 Government should ask every GST filer for giving total
number of permanent employees on payroll and total no of contract employees on
payroll Some tax deduction (per person) may be given for domestic help, if
their name and details are registered with tax authorities by the household
employing them.

Currently NPS give extra tax deductions of Rs 50,000 p.a. Government should
continue this incentive and provide new incentives also to encourage people to
join NPS.

Earlier, the congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said, that the prime minister
should say if he is unable to address the problems like unemployment and the
Congress will come and do it in six months. “Farmers and youth are the two
main issues concerning India and if Modiji cannot address these, he should say
so and the Congress will come and do it in six months,” Congress Vice
-president Rahul Gandhi had said during the recent Uttar Prasdesh polls.

442,"Ofcourse he does. **One Nation, One Election is a** ***jumla*** **that has been exposed many times here. These are the real reasons why Modi and the BJP want it**:

1. **BJP politics is heavily based on money-power** and communal polarisation. Fighting one election would be cheaper and easier for them than for the other political parties who do not rely as much on media manipulations, media marketing and communal polarisation as the BJP and Modi.

2. Having only one state and central elections every 5 years is only possible if we have a **fixed-term** for government. **This is how Modi plans to convert our democracy to banana republic under his dictatorship.** A fixed-term for a government would mean any party or alliance that forms the government first, and anyone who becomes the CM or PM, can remain in power for the full term **even if they lose majority in the assembly or parliament**. This takes away the right of the opposition to hold a government accountable for its failures by moving a no-confidence motion against them.

3. Imagine a situation where a government has no majority in the parliament, but due to fixed-term still runs the executive - the government will never be able to run properly as it would never be able to make any laws in parliament to implement its policies as the opposition with the majority won't allow it. Neither the government nor the opposition will be able to run the country as the executive can't make laws while the opposition can't implement the laws it makes!

4. The current features of our democracy and elections are part of the [basic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_structure_doctrine) of our constitution. Point 2 and 3 violates it and thus this whole *jumla* can never really survive constitutionally unless Modi first stuffs our judiciary with RSS judges.

4. The whole theory behind this *jumla* is that it has been observed that when some state election falls near any parliament elections, the one who wins the parliament election also generally wins the state elections. Thus, Modi and the BJP hope to come to power at state and central at one go. **Modi wants this badly as they can only change the constitution of india if they have an absolute  majority** - in the *Lok Sabha*, the *Rajya Sabha*, and in many states.

**tl;dr**: *One election, one state cannot be practically implemented in our democracy, offers no real benefit to our country, and only benefits Modi and the BJP who don't respect our constitution and want to turn our country into a banana republic.*",2018-01-21 17:07:04
443,"Lol. The truth is simpler - [PM mixes up existing employees with new employment](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/politics/pm-mixes-up-existing-employees-with-new-employment).

&gt; The very next day Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the numbers and the study “authored by SBI group Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh and Pulak Ghosh, a professor with the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore,” who calculated the number of jobs in enterprises from the membership of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Employees' State Insurance Corporation, General Provident Fund and National Pension System(NPS).

&gt; Both Yadav and the Prime Minister gave the impression that in the last one year between 8 to 10 million “new jobs” were created in the formal sector. This was used by both to debunk claims of jobless growth and job losses due to demonetisation and the GST.

...

&gt; Business Standard in fact quoted the central PF Commissioner V P Joy as saying, ***“the EPFO subscriber base might only be showing a formalisation of the workforce, not an addition to the job numbers ...*** *as a result of this (our move), workers who earlier were out of the social protection coverage will now get these benefits""*.

**My one-night stand as an Aaptard, writes Ramachandra Guha** 

 ______ 
The strangest dream I ever had was in the city of Houston. It was in March
2014, and I was on a tour through the United States, promoting the first
volume of my Gandhi biography. In my dream I met a well-known academic who had
joined the Aam Aadmi Party and urged me to do likewise. It was time, he said,
for us to give up our careers and plunge into politics to save our country.
The academic in my dream had left his job to fight a parliamentary seat in his
native Rajasthan on behalf of AAP; he asked me to follow suit and contest a
Lok Sabha seat too.

The dream shook me. I had long believed that scholars must stay away from
politics. On the other hand, I was disgusted by the two major parties in
India. I saw the BJP as communal and sectarian; the Congress as corrupt and
sycophantic. AAP, newly-formed, exuded hope and promise.

Waking up in the middle of the night, I called my wife in Bengaluru and told
her about my dream. She said, don’t be absurd, politics is not for you. You
are too much of a maverick to be part of an organisation. Besides, you will
never win an election. I went back to sleep, and, astonishingly, had another
dream about the same subject. This time, another academic I admired told me
that I should contest the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. This second
interlocutor suggested I contest from Dehradun, the town in which I was born
and raised.

To have the same dream twice in a night shook me thoroughly. I called my wife
again. I told her that this was a signal I must consider seriously. By the
time of the 2019 general elections, the second volume of my Gandhi biography
would be done. Why not, at this stage, move from writing books to fighting
elections? Surely actions were more effective than words? If I believed Indian
democracy needed redemption and renewal, was it not hypocritical to continue
to stand aside? My wife sighed and said, you have been away from India too
long.

The two academics I met in my dreams are both major figures in Indian
intellectual life. But—since it was a dream—it would not be proper to identify
them. However, neither was Yogendra Yadav, another respected scholar who had
in fact joined the Aam Aadmi Party.

From Houston I moved to San Francisco, from there to Seattle and then on to
the East Coast. On one of these long transcontinental flights I woke up from
my fantasy. I knew that I had some proficiency and experience in writing
books. I had absolutely no background in politics, and my temperament
suggested that I would be wholly unsuited to it. By the time I returned home
in April, the thought of contesting on behalf of AAP had disappeared from my
mind.

Before these dreams, I had never remotely considered entering politics. I
disliked the Congress, distrusted the Communists, and detested the BJP. And I
had little time for caste-and-region-based parties either.

George Orwell once said that ‘a writer must never be a loyal member of a
political party’. I believed that a writer must never be a disloyal member of
a political party either. Intellectual integrity required one to be absolutely
independent from all parties and politicians.

And yet I dreamt, not once but twice in a single night, that I must enter
politics and fight elections on behalf of a particular party. I think the
dream signified two things; one personal, the other political. Like other
writers, I had a complex about activists, and felt that I was not doing enough
to transform my society for the better. Paradoxically, the more books one
wrote, the more one became established in one’s profession, the greater the
guilt about being a mere chronicler rather than a real change-maker.

Beyond my own personal anxieties and confusions, my dream also pointed to the
immense appeal that the Aam Aadmi Party had in its early years. So many people
across India were attracted to it. Here, at last, they thought, was an
alternative to the BJP, the Congress, and the casteist BSP and SP and RJD.
While priding myself in public for my independence from all political parties,
somehow, subconsciously, I had also succumbed to the notion that this was a
party with a difference.

Of course we now know otherwise. The manner in which Arvind Kejriwal purged
Yogendra Yadav showed that he is as desirous of power as Narendra Modi or
Mamata Banerjee. And the manner in which Kejriwal has chosen his party’s Rajya
Sabha members shows that he is as enamoured of wealthy candidates as the BJP
and Congress.

It is now three-and-a-half years since I had those two dreams in a single
night in Houston. I have not since thought of entering politics. But I suppose
I shall never be entirely rid of feelings of guilt and inadequacy, of thinking
that the life of action is somehow more significant than the life of the mind.

Meanwhile, I console myself with the thought that democracy is not about party
politics alone. Doctors, social workers, teachers, entrepreneurs, feminists
and environmentalists can all contribute to the renewal of India, to bridging
the gap between the ideals of the Constitution and the reality on the ground.
And perhaps one day a party will be formed to sincerely and consistently take
forward these ideals in the sphere of electoral politics. However, I know that
I shall not bring myself to join this party, whether awake or in my dreams.

Credit of the SC judgment on Triple Talaq goes to Muslim women, not Modi or BJP.

Triple Talaq has been abolished because of hundreds and thousands of Muslim women came out openly and fought against it so courageously. 

BJP suffer from a patriarchal mindset and do politics of appeasement when it comes to women’s equality question. For example on one hand they have Ujjwala and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao on the other hand is their stance on marital rape.

**""Abdul Kalam Was Space Scientist, PM Modi A Social Scientist"": Ram Nath Kovind** 

 ______ 
**Ahmedabad: **

President Ram Nath Kovind today drew a parallel between APJ Abdul Kalam and
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying while the former President was a ""space
scientist"", the current Prime Minister is a ""social scientist"".

President Kovind was addressing the 66th convocation ceremony of the Gujarat
University (GU) in Ahmedabad.

""Kalam sir was ultimately and fortunately my predecessor. Though he became the
president, he was basically a scientist. Thus, I usually refer to him as a
'space scientist' while I call Modiji a 'social scientist',"" President Kovind
said in his address.

""While Modiji was an alumnus of the Gujarat University, Kalam sir too had
stayed here for some time,"" he said.

On a lighter note, the President said that none of the students present at the
ceremony would have sold tea like PM Modi did in his younger days.

""...This is a person who was born and brought up here, studied here and then
become the Prime Minister. This was truly inspirational,"" he said.

He said that PM Modi opened the doors of the 21st century for today's
generation by bringing in various initiatives, such as 'Digital India' and
'Start Up India'.

President Kovind urged students to keep in mind the ethos of cooperation and
brotherhood to bring in development.

As many as 56,159 graduates of the GU, the oldest varsity of the state, were
awarded degrees at the convocation ceremony.

**RSS to axe Togadia, 2 others for attacks on govt** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Peeved at their confrontational stance towards the BJP brass and
the government at the Centre, RSS is planning to remove VHP international
working president

Pravin Togadia

and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh general secretary

Virjesh Upadhyay

.

VHP international president

Raghav Reddy

, too, is on the Sangh's 'sack' list. Sources said senior RSS functionaries
were unhappy at the way the three had being following their own agenda,
embarrassing the government. They also believe the huge cadre base of the two
organisations has not been utilised for the propagation of the Sangh ideology.

Insiders said VHP's executive meeting will be convened by the end of February,
where RSS will push for the election of a new president, replacing Reddy and
his supporters, including Togadia. A meeting of the 'pratinidhi sabha' - the
Parivar's top decision-making body - is slated for March and a new VHP chief
could be elected before that.

Sources said the RSS brass had made up its mind to ease out those who had
opened a front against the BJP government, including PM Modi. The Sangh is
keen that its front organisations avoid confrontation with the government, and
sort out differences amicably. The larger view is that structural changes in
the organisations had become unavoidable to prevent any confusion among cadres
before the 2019 general elections.

The recent episode involving Togadia, wherein he alleged a plot to kill him in
a police encounter, has only fuelled the fire. Togadia and Upadhyay have often
embarrassed the Centre and the BJP leadership by speaking against the Modi
government on crucial issues. The role of some office-bearers is also under
the scanner for covertly extending support to the Patidar quota agitation.

RSS had tried to ring in changes in the VHP brass at its last executive
committee meeting, in December, where senior Sangh functionaries suggested
that former Himachal Pradesh governor V S Kokje replace Reddy.

However, Reddy and Togadia supporters prevailed, and Reddy was allowed to
continue until a full-time international president was elected. Reddy was
elected to the post in 2011 and 2014 and nominated supporters to key
positions, like Togadia. The VHP chief's tenure is for three years.

Although supporters of Togadia and Reddy dominate VHP, most of its cadres have
their roots in RSS. Sources said RSS has been trying to convince VHP cadres
about the need for changes at the top. It is learnt that Togadia, Reddy and
Upadhyay will be asked to quit, and voted out if they don't.

This is what led to Kejriwal's downfall , blaming Modi for everything without looking in the mirror himself , 
hmm.....that just might be the case for the downfall of our country too.......

But then again this is the country where people blame Modi on twitter for Local Buses being late.

Atleast i expected morw from people here.

Many of these organisations have rules that you have to regularly deposit part of your income in these programs or your account can be deactivated or closed and you may need to even pay fines to reactivate it. 

Probably due to the poor handling of economy by Modi *kaka* there have been many defaults (people can only save money if they can afford to, right?) and many such accounts had been deactivated or closed. But then there was an amnesty scheme introduced for such defaulters and some new schemes to entice new members to join these programs and thus many defaulters and those with jobs but who were never earlier a part of these programs, have joined (or rejoined) as the case may be.

**India's Richest 1% Corner 73% Of Wealth Generation: Oxfam Survey** 

 ______ 
**Davos: **

The richest 1 per cent in India cornered 73 per cent of the wealth generated
in the country last year, a new survey showed today, presenting a worrying
picture of rising income inequality.

Besides, 67 crore Indians comprising the population's poorest half saw their
wealth rise by just 1 per cent, as per the survey released by the
international rights group Oxfam hours before the start of the annual
congregation of the rich and powerful from across the world in this resort
town.

The situation appears even grimmer globally,

where 82 per cent of the wealth

generated last year worldwide went to the 1 per cent, while 3.7 billion people
that account for the poorest half of population saw no increase in their
wealth.

The annual Oxfam survey is keenly watched and is discussed in detail at the
World Economic Forum Annual Meeting where rising income and gender inequality
is among the key talking points for the world leaders.

Last year's survey had showed that India's richest 1 per cent held a huge 58
per cent of the country's total wealth higher than the global figure of about
50 per cent.

This year's survey also showed that the wealth of India's richest 1 per cent
increased by over Rs 20.9 lakh crore during 2017 -- an amount equivalent to
total budget of the central government in 2017-18, Oxfam India said.

The report titled 'Reward Work, Not Wealth', Oxfam said, reveals how the
global economy enables wealthy elite to accumulate vast wealth even as
hundreds of millions of people struggle to survive on poverty pay.

""2017 saw an unprecedented increase in the number of billionaires, at a rate
of one every two days. Billionaire wealth has risen by an average of 13 per
cent a year since 2010 -- six times faster than the wages of ordinary workers,
which have risen by a yearly average of just 2 per cent,"" it said.

In India, it will take 941 years for a minimum wage worker in rural India to
earn what the top paid executive at a leading Indian garment firm earns in a
year, the study found.

In the US, it takes slightly over one working day for a CEO to earn what an
ordinary worker makes in a year, it added.

Citing results of the global survey of 120,000 people surveyed in 10
countries, Oxfam said it demonstrates a groundswell of support for action on
inequality and nearly two-thirds of all respondents think the gap between the
rich and the poor needs to be urgently addressed.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the WEF meeting in Davos, Oxfam
India urged the Indian government to ensure that the country's economy works
for everyone and not just the fortunate few.

It asked the government to promote inclusive growth by encouraging labour-
intensive sectors that will create more jobs; investing in agriculture; and
effectively implementing the social protection schemes that exist.

Oxfam also sought sealing of the ""leaking wealth bucket"" by taking stringent
measures against tax evasion and avoidance, imposing higher tax on super-rich
and removing corporate tax breaks.

The survey respondents in countries like the US, UK and India also favoured 60
per cent pay cut for CEOs.

The key factors driving up rewards for shareholders and corporate bosses at
the expense of workers' pay and conditions, Oxfam said, include erosion of
workers' rights; excessive influence of big business over government
policymaking; and the relentless corporate drive to minimise costs in order to
maximise returns to shareholders.

About India, it said the country added 17 new billionaires last year, taking
the total number to 101. The Indian billionaires' wealth increased to over Rs
20.7 lakh crore -- increasing during last year by Rs 4.89 lakh crore, an
amount sufficient to finance 85 per cent of the all states' budget on health
and education.

It also said India's top 10 per cent of population holds 73 per cent of the
wealth and 37 per cent of India's billionaires have inherited family wealth.
They control 51 per cent of the total wealth of billionaires in the country.

Oxfam India CEO Nisha Agrawal said it is alarming that the benefits of
economic growth in India continue to concentrate in fewer hands.

""The billionaire boom is not a sign of a thriving economy but a symptom of a
failing economic system. Those working hard, growing food for the country,
building infrastructure, working in factories are struggling to fund their
child's education, buy medicines for family members and manage two meals a
day. The growing divide undermines democracy and promotes corruption and
cronyism,"" she said.

__ Comments

The survey also showed that women workers often find themselves at the bottom
of the heap and nine out of 10 billionaires are men.

In India, there are only four women billionaires and three of them inherited
family wealth. ""It would take around 17.5 days for the best paid executive at
a top Indian garment company to earn what a minimum wage worker in rural India
will earn in their lifetime (presuming 50 years at work),"" Oxfam said.

Yeah this is an annoying thing, if people hate him so much they shouldn't mention him in threads he's not relevant in.

I too, used to find Modi very charismatic and thought he was a very powerful leader. If he's such a powerful leader, then why aren't concrete steps being taken to protect the minorities? Can he only do _kadi ninda_?

I was too young when 2002 happened, so I don't know what happened then. And while many people have said many things,  he was largely accused of not doing enough to protect the rights of minorities, assuming he did not abet them. How is it any different to what's happening on a pan-India level now? He's such a powerful leader but he can't keep his party members in check?
