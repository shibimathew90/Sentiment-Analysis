I'm no Modi fan, but I drove from Jaipur to Delhi today, a trip I make nearly 15 times an year since my parents live in Jaipur. The flyovers on this highay have been under construction for the last 5 years, yet I never saw any actual work. 

Today, after all these years, I finally saw construction vehicles on the flyovers. A couple of them were even opened up for traffic. My trip took just 4 hrs today instead of the normal 6

But he made a ladder with those stones and climbed up to the pinnacle of success. Not only that he is taking ordinary people like me also up the ladder.

Even NaMo will have to take policy decisions where he will give resources to private industries for a cheap price or free. That will not be a scam in itself. That is policy decision. If money is exchanged to favour some specific persons. Then it will be a scam.

31,"Frankly, there is no way we can say for sure how it would work. You will just have to wait and see who is right. Everything else is a guess and a hope.


**Modi's view:**

* Modi's logic is that media has always been against him, so he has won despite them. 
* He knows that perception management via social media worked for him, and will possibly work again. (I am not saying his, his people are saying this)
* His ministers initially ruined his own honeymoon period in governance by randomly getting into controversies, so it made sense to shut their mouths and allow only those who he trusts to talk.
* Hotheads within the party cannot be trusted. 
* Bureaucrats cannot be trusted as the majority of them are used to UPA. Keep untrustworthy ones away, and the trustworthy ones anyway do not speak.
* A rearguard action has to be fought against RSS, which is worried that Modi will do to them what he did to them in Gujarat - take the party away from their path, to Moditva (the paths sometimes track parallel, sometimes do not)
* Development and progress are their own messages. No need to communicate too much and fall into traps laid by an untrustworthy media.

**How it MIGHT go wrong**

* The social media team which took care of perceptions online is not active anymore. This means there could be an opportunity for 'sickulars' to take over and control messages - which may begin to show some impact over time.
* NDA does not talk. UPA or whatever is left of it, does. Obviously media will continue talking to whoever is talking to them, so media may develop a stronger anti NDA/ Modi stand over time.
* Pique. Top editors will turn furious over time about the perceived slight and their irritation at the lack of access will reflect in their papers / channels more and more.
* The Manmohan effect: MMS was made fun of thoroughly in social media over time, so much that after a couple of years, ridiculing MMS was absolutely normal. Without active counter arguments, NaMo may become the new face of ridicule. And trying to tackle it the way Kibal tackled it will see mainstream media playing defence for the SM attackers.

**There is no way we can be sure which way it will go.**

Meanwhile, NaMo supporters, as your PM has given up on the media, now the battle lines are clear. They are with Congress and SP and everyone else. So are you going to stop asking them to be neutral? :D

Now that it's clear can we put a stop to the ridiculous accusations floating around about how the media is pro-Modi and how he is 'manipulating' them?

I think these rumours come from Modi haters who know the truth(media being on their side) but still lie about it to have another reason to attack Modi and deflect the (true) excuse of Modi's supporters that the media is biased against him.",2014-07-28 15:26:42

34,"&gt; favorite trope of the liberals.

You are cherry picking the statistics - to say it nicely.


&gt; any Sanghi has asked for a retaliation against Indian muslims for events 

Err No - You are sidestepping the issue - The global events are held as proof for the brutality of muslims and then the stick of the 'ummah' is brought about to clump all muslims together and make them guilty by association.

Then the blame game starts on muslim violence as a global phenomenon and the need for the Hindu defense by keeping the local muslims in check..

Your retaliation / violence / anger games start after that.

&gt;I actually wish Indians were more sensitive to how our two Muslim majority neighbors were treating their religious minorities

I too wish for this :( . However sensitive should mean protest at a nation to nation level - not internal shitting on our minorities.


But think from an Indian muslim's perspective right now . Namo has chosen not to attend a single iftar . Where Barack Obama chose to prove his 'communalism' and host an iftar . The PM neither hosted , nor attended  - something that was seen as ordinary politeness before..

From the local minority's viewpoint - they would be troubled at the least . For the larger hindu right - all this is fuel for more baiting with what they would assume as tacit approval from the top. And the overall atmosphere slowly vitiates more with the goondas and the simpletons on both sides indulging in one-upmanship.

This sort of slide towards the bottom is what worries the OP , I think and worries me as well.

35,"&gt; You are cherry picking the statistics - to say it nicely.

The thrust of my argument was not about counting the number of dead and broken bodies, it is about understanding the dynamic which created the conditions for the riots in the first place. 

You made a claim that muslims are the community that suffers overwhelmingly in any riot and therefore, no muslim will want to start a riot. I simply pointed out the only statistics that are available for an entire year (not one riot here and another there) that break down the numbers on a per religion basis show that the premise of your statement  (that more muslims suffer in riots) was incorrect. 

Even if the premise were to be correct, there is no proof that the conclusion (no muslim would want a riot) is supported by any evidence. Evidence, if any, is quite to the contrary. E.g. look at the Hamas/Israel conflict. Even though Hamas was certain to be the loser in that little war, they still continue to lob rockets at Israel even when a ceasefire was on the table! Or look at the latest little brouhaha in Kerala about a school serving pork. Your statement is simply a plausible conjecture with no evidence supporting it. 

&gt; The global events are held as proof for the brutality of muslims and then the stick of the 'ummah' is brought about to clump all muslims together and make them guilty by association.

I think the connection between reality and your perception is tenuous. There has never been a riot in India because of violence by muslims on others abroad. Even at the height of the Hindu genocide in Bangladesh, India did not see Hindu-Muslim riots. On the other hand, Islamism is a global movement. When discussing Islamism, the fruit that this dragon seed bears is pertinent to the discussion.

&gt; But think from an Indian muslim's perspective right now . Namo has chosen not to attend a single iftar . .. The PM neither hosted , nor attended - something that was seen as ordinary politeness before..

He did not come to power promising the same old politics of tokenism. He came to power promising a different kind of politics. You need to give him a chance to prove himself. So far, he has not taken any decision that can be termed as 'anti muslim'.

&gt; all this is fuel for more baiting with what they would assume as tacit approval from the top. And the overall atmosphere slowly vitiates more with the goondas and the simpletons on both sides indulging in one-upmanship. This sort of slide towards the bottom is what worries the OP , I think and worries me as well.

So Manmohan Singh hosting tens of Iftaars somehow stemmed violence. I see the premise, I see the conclusion. I just dont see the evidence that connects the two. I just dont see any average muslim terribly concerned that a few grand poobahs were not invited to stuff their mouths with delicacies after a day of fasting. ",2014-07-29 02:25:40
