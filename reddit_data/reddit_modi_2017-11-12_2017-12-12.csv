In a significant sign of trilateral cooperation, the first consignment of wheat from India to Afghanistan, that was flagged off by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Afghan counterpart Salahuddin Rabbani on October 29, reached the Afghan city of Zaranj near the Iran-Afghanistan border on Saturday via the Iranian port of Chabahar, thereby bypassing Pakistan ""First India wheat shipment via #Chabahar welcomed into Zaranj #Afghanistan with traditional song, dance and joy! Proud moment!!,"" Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan Manpreet Vohra tweeted.Vohra said that pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani decorated Zaranj as the shipment arrived.The shipment to Afghanistan comes in the wake of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's one-day visit to India on October 24. India is a major development aid partner for strife-torn Afghanistan.While flagging off the shipment on October 29, Sushma Swaraj also thanked Iran ""for providing assistance in facilitating the movement of this gift through Chabahar Port"".""This shows the convergence between the ancient civilisations of India, Afghanistan and Iran to spur unhindered flow of commerce and trade throughout the region,"" she said.The shipment is part of a commitment made by India to supply 1.1 million tonnes of wheat for the people of Afghanistan on a grant basis.This is the first shipment to go to Afghanistan through Chabahar after the trilateral agreement to develop the port as a transport and transit corridor between India, Iran and Afghanistan was signed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Iranian and Afghan Presidents Hassan Rouhani and Ashraf Ghani, respectively, in May last year.

**There will be Ram Rajya by 2022, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath** 

 ______ 
Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said there would be ‘Ram Rajya’ in the country very soon, indirectly indicating that the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya will be completed by 2022.

“Dreams are always seen to be realized,” he said when asked if he would fulfill the dream of his mentor Mahant Avaidyanath, who was so closely associated with the temple movement.

Adityanath was interacting with daily Hindustan’s editor-in-chief Shashi Shekhar after inaugurating the ‘Hindustan Shikhar Samagam, an annual conclave, at a five-star hotel here.

On the deadline for the temple construction, the CM said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had put up a 2022 vision seeking to free the country from filth, poverty and anarchy and thereby establishing the ‘Ram Raj’ in the country.

When asked if the foundation stone for the temple would be laid by the time his government completes one year in office, Adityanath replied saying “We are working in that direction moving from ‘sankalp (resolution) to ‘siddhi’ (attainment) every day.”

Insisting that when intentions are pure, God too helps, he said, though in a different context, that nothing was impossible for a Yogi.

To a question if his recent visit to the Taj Mahal and wielding the broom to clean the historic monument that had been, of late, in a controversy, should be seen as his beginning of entering into a compromise and peace (read with the Muslim community), the CM said he had already made the beginning from Ayodhya.

“We will develop all tourist places, Ayodhya and Agra included,” he said.

On law and order

Talking about the growing police encounters in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said his government had given a free hand to the police to deal with criminals acting on its policy of zero tolerance on crime.

He claimed this was for the first time that criminals were in fear. “This is why criminals are now getting their bails cancelled while many others have surrendered to police or in courts not only in UP but in other states also,” he said.

He blamed the previous governments for demoralizing the police force by its gross misuse.

Claiming that 1.46 lakh posts of police constables and sub-inspectors were lying vacant in UP, he said all the posts will be filled within next three years.

Around 47,000 of them will be filled by the end of this year only, he claimed.

“We will also reinstate the 54 PAC companies that the previous government had abolished.

When pointed out that controversies had been raised over the functioning of the force from time to time, he said the PAC was a commendable force.

Replying to a question from the audience as to what the government was doing to save women from domestic violence, the CM said, “The 75 rescue vans, one each in all the districts, had been deployed for this purpose, apart from launching the dedicated helplines.”

He claimed his government was trying to create a lot of job opportunities for the youth in the private sector by creating a favourable climate for the industries in terms of a better law and order and infrastructure like expressways, regional air connectivity and 24X7 electricity.

**Google can’t replace Guru: Venkaiah Naidu** 

 ______ 
Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said teachers play a key role in transforming the society and they can never be replaced by anything, including Google.

“No doubt Google is important, but it can never replace the place of guru (teachers) in the life of students,” Naidu said addressing a congregation of graduate, post-graduate and doctorate degree recipients at the 13th Convocation Ceremony of KIIT University in Bhubaneswar.

“Hence the students should be grateful to their gurus and at the same time work to serve mother, mother tongue, and motherland.”

“There is nothing wrong in learning English, Hindi or French, (but) students should also be proficient in their mother tongue which comes from the heart and helps one to express his feeling better,” said the vice president.

He said the country will grow when the higher education sector develops.

“We are in the age of LPG -- Liberalisation, Privatisation, and Globalisation. Life has become very competitive today. Therefore, students should prepare themselves for learning new skills and acquiring new knowledge in the contemporary world.”

Hailing the country’s great culture, he said there is need to go back to the roots.

“India has a great heritage and you should feel proud as inheritors of the great Indian culture. Unity in diversity and being rooted in our culture are important for the integrity of our country,” he added.

Calling India a land of opportunities, he said one can achieve anything with hard work and passion irrespective of one’s background, citing the examples of former president late APJ Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Odisha Governor SC Jamir, who also graced the occasion, advised students to work hard, be persistent as well as accommodating, be innovative and entrepreneurial, and to use technology to solve societal problems.

During the convocation, the University honoured three eminent personalities from different walks of life with D.Litt. Honoris Causa degrees -- Raghunath Mohapatra, eminent sculptor; Bithal Das Mundhra, Chairman Emeritus, Simplex Infrastructures Ltd; and Kishanlal Agarwal, Chairman, Bhartia Charitable Trust.

**New India by 2022 will be free of corruption, terror: PM Narendra Modi in Independence Day speech** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 New India by 2022 will be free of corruption and terrorism: PM Modi.

2 Year 2022 will mark the 75th year of Independence.

3 Congress have slammed PM Modi calling his speech false promise.

While addressing the nation on 71st Independence Day today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi insisted that there would be a New India by 2022 - when India will mark 75 years of independence.

""I Invoke Team India to run for a New India by 2022. By then the poor shall have concrete houses, the farmer shall double his income, youths and women will get ample opportunities, an India free of casteism, terrorism, corruption, nepotism, a clean India,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

PM Modi spoke on a plethora of issues concerning the nation. He spoke extensively on topics ranging from mob violence to the ongoing issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Talking to an energetic crowd, PM Modi instilled hope in many saying that a new hope had replaced the prevalent hopelessness.

""The usual attitude of 'chalta hai, theek hai, chalne do' (complacency) has been replaced and a new chapter has begun,"" said PM Modi.

Addressing the nation from the Red Fort, Modi warned those indulging in mob violence, saying attacks in the name of ""aastha"" (faith) was not something to be happy about and won't be accepted.

In a 56-minute speech, his fourth from the Red Fort, Modi touched upon various topics including demonetisation, black money and corruption and promised to take India ahead ""with greater speed"". He hoped the campaign against Triple Talaq would succeed.

CONGRESS CALLS IT HOLLOW PROMISES

Immediately after the prime minister finished his address, Congress accused him of making false promises. The Congress leadership hoped that rather than making empty promises, PM Modi should have given an account of the promises that had been fulfilled in the past three years.

On the eve of Independence Day, the party also hoped that Modi would talk about the state of the economy, the sharp decline in investment and loss of jobs in the country.

Senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said that when the prime minister addresses the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort tomorrow, he should refrain from making more tall promises and false and hollow claims about the achievements of his government.

""We request and advise the prime minister to give an account of how many promises that he made to people of the country in the last three years have been fulfilled. How many jobs has this government created and how many jobs have been lost. And if jobs have not been created, who should we hold responsible,"" Sharma said.

**BJP MP, who said PM Modi doesn’t like to be questioned, to meet Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
Maharashtra BJP MP Nana Patole. (File/Photo) Maharashtra BJP MP Nana Patole. (File/Photo)

Dissident BJP MP from Gondia-Bhandara Nana Patole continued to spit fire against “party’s policies”, saying he is slated to meet Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi during the forthcoming Winter Session of Parliament “on the latter’s request”.

Patole, however, kept dodging queries regarding his possible voluntary exit from the party.

“The party should carefully see for itself. I am getting invited by many other parties. I am not intending to quit the party. My point is only about exhorting the party to take corrective steps on many issues, the agrarian crisis in particular about which I have long been speaking out,” Patole said at a press conference in Nagpur on Thursday.

The outspoken MP, who had stirred a hornet’s nest about two months ago, when he said at a public function here that Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn’t like to be questioned or criticised, attacked BJP spokesman Madhav Bhandari for his earlier remarks.

“Bhandari, who had gone into hiding upon not being made MLC, should keep off me and should address the issues confronting people. And he should check records when he says I should raise the issues at party forum and not in public. I have raised these issues with PM, in parliament and at party’s Pune convention,” Patole said.

“I can take the bulls by their horns (koni angavar ala tar shingavar gheu shakto),” Patole thundered.

Patole also announced that he is going to hold a farmers’ rally at Akola on December 1, which would be attended by senior party leaders Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha.

“The rally is for highlighting the problems of cotton, soyabean and paddy farmers in Vidarbha. Both the state and Central government should address the issue honestly since number of farmers’ suicides has shot very high up. My whole fight with Modi was on this issue,” he said.

Patole also asked, “they said demonetisation has benefited the country. They should tell the people as to how much black money has been detected. They said they have unearthed Rs 300 crore from a man in Hyderabad. I checked from my sources to find that there was no such person there.”

Asked why he doesn’t meet RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who has also flagged the issue of informal sectors and farmers and who wields moral authority over BJP, Patole said, “if they don’t listen to even him, why should I go and meet him?”

Asked why he doesn’t resign from the party which he is so disillusioned with, Patole said, “I only want that in the remaining two years the party should mend its ways and do something good for people, particularly farmers. And I don’t have any fascination for power. I came to this party when they had poor presence in 2009 and I had won as an independent then.”

When persistent queries about why he wished to continue in a party that doesn’t listen to him, Patole quipped, “let them declare that they have ushered in Peshwai then I will see.” The term Peshwai is derisively used by some historians to describe “misrule” under Brahmin Peshwa rulers of Maharashtra.”

Patole also flagged issues concerning OBCs like scholarships to OBC students. “Modi was touted as OBC leader but OBC students are not getting scholarships. Instead of an OBC, someone else got the jacket to wear,” Patole said in an oblique reference to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

**Modi said to approve $14 billion injection to rural road plan** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning to spend an additional $14 billion to provide road connectivity in India’s remote villages by March 2020, officials with knowledge of the plan said.About Rs 1.4 lakh crore has already been spent under the program. The cost will be shared in the ratio of 60:40 by the federal and state governments, the officials said, asking not to be identified citing rules.A boost to the rural roads programme ahead of crucial state polls and a national election in 2019 may assist Modi, who has been criticized for pulling down India’s economic growth to a three-year low with his shock cash ban last November and the chaotic introduction of the goods and services tax in July.The funds would be spent as part of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana -- a program for ""all-weather"" rural roads started by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2000. Started as part of a poverty reduction strategy, it was widely lauded for connecting isolated hamlets and allowing small businesses deliver their produce faster.Rural development secretary Amarjeet Sinha wasn’t immediately available for a comment.The programme ""is now being implemented as never before"" and the pace of construction of roads accelerated to reach 133 km a day in 2016-17, against an average of 73 km in 2011-2014, finance minister Arun Jaitley said in his budget speech in February.Even though economic growth rebounded after Modi assumed office in 2014, the benefits have not been felt by farmers and jobless youth. Modi’s attempts at changing archaic labor and land laws to make it easy for businesses were labeled pro-wealthy by his critics and his party lost elections in the national capital and Bihar two years ago.

**Not to pursue Islamic banking in India, says RBI**

New Delhi: In a major move, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided not to pursue a proposal for introduction of Islamic banking in the country. Replying to an RTI query, the central bank said the decision was taken after considering “the wider and equal opportunities” available to all citizens to access banking and financial services.

Islamic or Sharia banking is a finance system based on the principles of not charging interest, which is prohibited under Islam. The issue of introduction of Islamic banking in India was examined by the RBI and the government of India, it said.

“Taking into account, the wider and equal opportunities available to all citizens to access banking and financial services, it has been decided not to pursue the proposal further,” the central bank said in its reply to the RTI application filed by this PTI correspondent.

The RBI was asked to provide details of steps being taken for the introduction of Islamic or ‘interest-free’ banking in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on 28 August 2014 launched Jan Dhan Yojana, a national mission to bring about comprehensive financial inclusion of all the households in the country.

In late 2008, a committee on Financial Sector Reforms, headed by former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, had stressed on the need for a closer look at the issue of interest-free banking in the country. “Certain faiths prohibit the use of financial instruments that pay interest. The non-availability of interest-free banking products results in some Indians, including those in the economically disadvantaged strata of society, not being able to access banking products and services due to reasons of faith,” the committee had said.

Later, on the instruction of the central government, an inter-departmental group (IDG) set up in the RBI examined the legal, technical and regulatory issues for introducing interest free banking in India and has submitted its report to the government.

The RBI had in February last year sent a copy of the IDG report to the finance ministry and recommended an “Islamic window” in conventional banks for gradual introduction of Sharia-compliant banking. “In our considered opinion, given the complexities of Islamic finance and various regulatory and supervisory challenges involved in the matter and also due to the fact that Indian banks have no experience in this field, Islamic banking may be introduced in India in a gradual manner. “Initially, a few simple products which are similar to conventional banking products may be considered for introduction through Islamic window of the conventional banks after necessary notification by the government,” it had said in a letter to the ministry.

The letter further reads: “It is also our understanding that interest free banking for financial inclusion will require a proper process of the product being certified as Sharia complaint will be required both on the asset and liability side and the funds received under the interest free banking could not be mingled with other funds and therefore, this banking will have to be conducted under a separate window.”

**AMU professor’s wife alleges talaq on WhatsApp** 

 ______ 
The Wife registered a case in Aligarh’s Civil Lines Police Station. (Source: ANI)

The wife of an Aligarh Muslim University professor has accused her husband of seeking to divorce her through WhatsApp, the police said today.

The woman had last week approached the police alleging her husband was “torturing” her and had locked their house to prevent her from entering it. SSP Rajesh Pandey said the wife met him last week and alleged her husband had sent her two “talaq” notices on WhatsApp.

“She requested us to settle the matter. The police informed the professor about the settlement process but he did not turn up before the settlement officer,” Pandey said.

A case has been registered against the professor on charges of “harassment and wrongfully preventing his wife from entering their house”, he said. The AMU academic, however, said the case was subjudice since October first week.

He said that according to the law, he had served two notices on his wife after the stipulated period and was preparing for the last one.

The professor claimed he had documentary evidence to prove his wife misled him about her past. “I have documents to prove that my wife had pledged to change her behaviour and save our marriage,” he said.

The husband said he voluntarily left his official bungalow to avoid confrontations with his wife. Meanwhile, the woman has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleging that her husband went against the Supreme Court’s recent judgement on “triple talaq”.

**It’s finally time to make the Pacific a bit bigger** 

 ______ 
The Trump administration’s decision to shelve its predecessors’ diffidence and junk the notion that the US might accommodate China’s preference for a unipolar “Asia-Pacific”. Photo: Reuters

As President Donald Trump makes his way across Asia, ears in local capitals have picked up a subtle but unmistakable change in messaging from the US administration. The shift focuses on an apparently innocuous term: “the Indo-Pacific.” US national security adviser H.R. McMaster introduced the president’s itinerary to reporters as “a great opportunity to demonstrate America’s and the Trump administration’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific.” Trump himself has used the term and it’s all over the official press releases from the White House.

This isn’t just semantics. The difference between the more commonly used “Asia-Pacific” and the new “Indo-Pacific” is actually quite deep. Those who prefer the latter want to stress that the great power conflicts in East, South and Southeast Asia are essentially maritime—over the control and openness of trade routes and over who gets to build and secure the infrastructure through which the vast majority of the world’s trade passes. By pushing the borders of America’s awareness as far as India, it means that China and its concerns are no longer at the center of US strategy. And it might also reflect a desire to “bring India permanently into the US web of alliances and partnerships in the region.”

For the Japanese, it reflects their pressing need to keep sea routes free of Chinese influence; for Indians, the term embodies the conviction that the most important relationship between any two capitals over the next century will be that between Delhi and Beijing. For the countries of Southeast Asia, the term mirrors the hope that a network of alliances, led by the US, Japan, Australia and India, would allow them to preserve their sovereignty and strategic independence amid China’s rise.

Indeed, the one country that clearly dislikes the term is China. And that may be the biggest takeaway from this presidential progress so far—the Trump administration’s decision to shelve its predecessors’ diffidence and junk the notion that the US might accommodate China’s preference for a unipolar “Asia-Pacific.” From an “America First” president, this willingness to ally if not lead in the effort to counterbalance China may be the best that countries in the region could have hoped for.

The phrase “Indo-Pacific” has been used before, of course, though only rarely by US presidents. During Shinzo Abe’s first term as prime minister of Japan in the mid-2000s, it was hoped that a “quadrilateral” that encompassed the US, Australia, Japan and India could help patrol sea lanes and stabilize the region. But that initiative foundered. Prime minister Kevin Rudd’s Australia, its economy thriving on China’s demand for commodities, had no intention of displeasing Beijing. India’s government wasn’t too keen on unsettling relations with its giant northern neighbour either.

Australia pulled out of the quadrilateral dialogue in 2008 explicitly to soothe Chinese sensitivities; Rudd’s foreign minister told the press after a visit from his Chinese counterpart that “one of the things that caused China concern last year was a meeting of that strategic dialogue. … Australia would not be proposing to have [another] dialogue of that nature.”

But times have changed. Having returned to power, Abe is firmly in command in Tokyo; he’s turned “a free and open Indo-Pacific” into something of a mantra. Meanwhile, the commodity market has cooled and Australia has been reminded of the costs of economic dependence. “Indo-Pacific” has become its official definition of its neighbourhood.

India’s Narendra Modi, who is close to Abe, has lately embraced the term as well, especially after his nation emerged from a nasty border confrontation with the People’s Republic. China’s protestations of a peaceful rise may not sound quite as credible in 2017 as they did in 2007.

Much work will need to be done before the new terminology results in practical changes on the ground, of course. Officials from the “quadrilateral” are likely to meet at the upcoming East Asia Summit in the Philippines. They will need to set concrete goals for military and strategic cooperation—for example, scheduling regular patrols together for their navies.

The meeting itself would send a message: When it became a possibility, China warned it had better not be set up to “target or damage a third party’s interest.” That’s probably not an issue yet. None of the countries is engaged or powerful or determined enough at the moment to contain Chinese ambition in the short-term. Still, leaders such as Trump and Abe have taken an important first step towards ensuring that, in the decades to come, China’s leaders don’t have it all their way in, yes, the Indo-Pacific.

**Ayurveda prescribes beef for several disorders: Scientist** 

 ______ 
CHENNAI: Ancient Indian scriptures imposed no bar on eating beef and, in fact, ayurvedic Acharya Charaka had recommended beef for some disorders, said veteran scientist P M Bhargava in his letter to President Pranab Mukherjee marking his returning the Padma Bhushan.TOI on October 29 first reported the decision of Bhargava, 87, the founder director of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, to return the award he got in 1986, as a mark of protest against rising intolerance in the country.Quoting Charaka Samhita, Bharagava said: ""The flesh of the cow is beneficial for those suffering from the loss of flesh due to disorders caused by an excess of vayu, rhinitis, irregular fever, dry cough, fatigue, and also in cases of excessive appetite resulting from hard manual labour.""Bhargava said the lynching of Mohamed Akhlaq in Dadri ""probably by fringe elements related to BJP"" showed ""the control that BJP wants to have on what we may eat ... just as it wants to control what we may wear, or whom we may love, or what we may read.""He called the Modi government ""the least knowledgeable"" about science. ""I am a professional scientist with an experience of 65 years. I have also had the occasion of interacting on matters of science with the governments at the Centre since Independence. I find the present government the least knowledgeable and least concerned about science. The climate of religious conservatism that we have today is a major obstacle in the functioning of science and thus in meeting developmental objectives.Bhargava was among the second batch of more than 100 scientists to sign an online petition last month against the ""rejection of reason' that led to the assassinations of scholar M M Kalburgi, rationalist Narendra Dabhoklar and communist Govind Pansare.In his letter to the President dated November 6, made available to TOI, the scientist named BJP and RSS behind the climate of intolerance. ""No one would be more aware than you that, de facto, BJP is the political front of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and functions under the leadership of RSS that is fully committed to the ideology of Hindutva, which I find divisive, unreasonable and unscientific,"" he said.Noting that according to the Constitution, one of the duties of our citizens is to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform, the letter said: ""Steeped in superstition, unreason and irrationality, much of what RSS and BJP do goes against the grain of scientific temper. An example would be the recent statement of Shri Mohan Bhagwat who heads the RSS that marriage is a contract according to which the woman is supposed to be only a housewife and not work outside.""Bhargava said the Padma Bhushan had been very dear to him. ""My returning it to you, for whom I have much respect and admiration, is an expression of my concern at the currently prevailing socio-politico situation in the country.""

**Congress tsunami will sweep polls under PM Modi’s chopper: Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
Rahul targeted Chief Minister Vijay Rupani over the SEBI imposing fine on his firm for alleged manipulative share trade, and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak out on the controversy following The Wire report on 16,000 times jump in the turnover of Jay Shah’s firm in the year following the BJP’s election to power at the Centre in 2014. Rahul targeted Chief Minister Vijay Rupani over the SEBI imposing fine on his firm for alleged manipulative share trade, and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak out on the controversy following The Wire report on 16,000 times jump in the turnover of Jay Shah’s firm in the year following the BJP’s election to power at the Centre in 2014.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked party workers not to make personal attacks on Narendra Modi and “maintain the respect of the Prime Minister’s Office”, even as he continued to target the PM over the issues of GST, demonetisation and corruption. Rahul said that the BJP’s “carpet-bombing” efforts to win Gujarat elections would fail in the face of a “tsunami” in the favour of his party.

As part of his ongoing Navsarjan Yatra ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections in December, the Congress leader toured Banaskantha and Patan districts on Sunday and visited local shines and met seers.

Rahul targeted Chief Minister Vijay Rupani over the SEBI imposing fine on his firm for alleged manipulative share trade, and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak out on the controversy following The Wire report on 16,000 times jump in the turnover of Jay Shah’s firm in the year following the BJP’s election to power at the Centre in 2014.

At a public meeting in Patan late in the evening, Rahul started his speech by raising slogan: “Jay Sardar, Jay Mataji and Jai Bhim” — identified with the communities of the Patidar, the OBCs and the Dalits, respectively. Both Patan and Banaskantha have significant population of these communities.

He then went on to say that Gujarat is a state “where every community was unhappy”. Rahul said that the BJP “oppressed” Gujarat for 22 years, “intimidated it and now, every community is protesting, Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor, Jignesh Mevani.tribal youths.all communities are protesting.there is plunder right before the PM’s eyes.”

Criticising the Modi government over its demonetisation move and also raising the issue of corruption, he said: “When the people were queuing up outside banks, the thieves of India were collecting their black money behind the scenes. Hindustan ke choron, ne aapki madad se apna pura kala dhan safed kar diya (all the thieves of India, with your help, turned their black money into white).He hit Gujarat the hardest”.

Earlier, interacting with the Gujarat Congress’s IT Cell team at Ambaji — a religious centre in Banaskantha district, Rahul said: “You are the guerilla army. Now, they say (BJP) ‘we will carpet bomb from above’. Aap upar se carpet bombing karo, hum neeche se apko saaf kar denge (You do carpet bombing and we will sweep you out from beneath). This is the reality in Gujarat… Modiji helicopter mein and neeche se tsunami (PM Narendra Modi in helicopter and tsunami on the ground). You will get to know this in December.”

Rahul and Congress’s Gujarat affairs in-charge Ashok Gehlot also lauded the party’s social media managers for popularising the Vikas Gando Thayo Che (vikas has gone crazy) campaign mocking the BJP’s claim of development in the state during its 22-year rule. But, they said that the party had to stop the campaign because it could have hurt the dignity of Prime Minister’s Office.

“Such was the success of our vikas pagal hai campaign that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to come out and claim that he is vikas and he is Gujarat. At that the point Rahul Gandhi wrote to me and said we should ask our team members to stop this campaign as PM’s Office has a dignity, and we need to respect that,” Geholt told the gathering.

Later, Rahul confirmed that he wrote to Gehlot. “Yes, it’s correct. I sent an e-mail to him and said that let us catch Narendra Modi’s mistakes, disturb the BJP, but keep the respect of PM’s Office. Remember, when Narendra Modiji was in the Opposition, how he used to disrespect the PM. This is the difference between them and us. We will not go beyond a point, but this is the truth that in Gujarat vikas pagal ho gaya hai… ye jhooth nahi hai,” the Congress vice-president said.

Asked about his growing number of followers on Twitter, Rahul on a lighter note said: “As I have said, Pidi tweets.” He was referring to the recent social media uproar over his Twitter post introducing his dog named Pidi. He further said: “Whatever I have to say, I discuss with my team members, give some suggestions and after some fine-tuning we say it on Twitter.” He, however, maintained that “these (political tweets) are my own views”.

Asked how he tackled social media campaign against him, Rahul said, “You know who Shiva was,” in what could have been a reference to the Hindu god consuming poison to save the universe.

He further said: “No matter how much money the BJP puts in destroying my image, my truth will not change and will people will see that.” Continuing with his criticism of demonetisation and the current form of GST, the Congress leader said: “Whose fault was demonetisation and GST. It was clear cut Narendra Modi’s mistake. But, did he even say one word that yes perhaps he committed a little mistake?”

He also alleged that the media have been controlled by Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. “Narendra Modi has the Delhi (central) government, police, Army, Air Force, and the media. Not mediaspersons — they want to promote truth, but they (the BJP) control from behind… Narendra Modi’s and Amit Shah’s control (the media) from behind. Like radio’s fine-tuning, Modi does fine-tuning of truth…. You are independent, so whatever comes in your mind, you can upload it on the social media. We do not have much but the truth,” Rahul said.

On alleged corruption in Gujarat, Rahul said: “The SEBI has said Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is corrupt and penalised him, and Amit Shah’s Jay Shah(zada)jyada kha gaya.” The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has fined 22 entities, including Rupani’s Hindu Undivided Family, for alleged manipulative trading in the shares of a company during the January-June 2011 period. Rupani has rejected the allegations and the Securities Appellate Tribunal has set aside the fine of Rs 6.91 crore imposed on 22 entities, including his firm.

Later speaking at Palanpur, Rahul said: “Gujarat mein pure desh me sabse jayada brashtachar hai (Most corruption cases are in Gujarat). Modiji please tell how Jay converted Rs 50,000 into Rs 80 crore (referring to The Wire report on Jay Shah’s company’s turnover)… people want to hear (from the PM) else they will think that you are not a chaukidar (a watchman) but bhagidar (partner in corruption).”

Rahul met Sadaram Bapa, 108-year-old spiritual head of Thakor Samaj in Totana village of Kankrej taluka in Banaskantha. Bapa has been spearheading a de-addiction campaign for several years. He also visited Valinath temple in Thara. The ancient Shiv temple is considered an important religious centre for the shepherd community in Gujarat.

**Short on facts: Collapse of left-inspired opposition** 

 ______ 
A searing piece on the vapidity of the Left’s intellectualism in Swarajya recently highlighted a very important aspect of the current political environment.The author Jaideep Prabhu stresses on the absence of an intellectual vanguard for the Left in advancing its ideology and in doing so also exposes the hollowness of the current state of opposition to the Narendra Modi-led BJP.For years, the country was deprived of a strong right-wing alternative as pseudo-Left, illiberal, socialist governments rode roughshod over the country’s economic needs, causing anarchy and near-bankruptcy. Now with the emergence of a strong right-wing government at the centre in 2014, it appears that the Leftinspired opposition is in terminal decline. Election results, obviously, are an important example of how much ground has been ceded by the opposition to the BJP.But that’s not the whole story. The hate filled attacks on Modi and his policies, the daily hit-jobs that are flashed across television channels, social media sites and news and opinion pages all point to another important reason for the decline of the opposition. The inability of the Left-inspired intellectual system to give a coherent, intellectual foundation to its criticism of the government and the arbitrary, chaotic nature of their attacks has been a big contributor to the overall opposition failure.Modi and his party may win or lose in 2019. They may also suffer reverses in the state polls. We don’t know as yet how things will play out. But the glib assumption among the intellectual class that Modi’s victories are due to weak nature of the opposition deserves some nuanced elaboration and context.He is winning because he has been successful in creating a narrative about his administration’s ability in dealing with the country’s problems. He has been successful in propagating his administration’s progress in solving these problems and creating a perception that his team is working on issues and responding to concerns.Now, we can all have legitimate grievances about NDA-II and question whether they have indeed been successful in repairing the damage to the economy.The jury, I would say, is still out though there have been a number of positive measures and progress is happening on many fronts. There are negatives as well, no doubt. But the problem with the Left-liberal intellectual system is its reliance on wholesale condemnation rather than criticism grounded on facts, data and logic. For instance, it is appropriate to criticise the government for its late response to the problem of PSU bank capitalisation. But it is completely idiotic to blame them for the bad loan mess.There are a number of other examples as well. For instance, the Left-liberal establishment fervently believes that the BJP government at the centre and states is bent upon installing some kind of a Taliban-like Hindu theocracy. They believe that the BJP and the entire right-wing ecosystem are nothing but a Gestapolike religious police who will rule our lives.How they manage to get this impression is not clear but it has a led to a tragi-comic situation where every minor crime, petty quarrel, small-time communal flare-up is being blown out of proportion only to prove this particular point. We even have headlines identifying the victim or perpetrator of a particular crime as belonging to this or that caste. A lot of this is also being done selectively. So BJP ruled states are often in the spotlight for violent crime, farmer suicides or cow vigilantism but Congress or oppositionruled states can get away with murder.Cow vigilantism should be condemned and criticised but how much attention are we paying to incidents of illegal cow-smuggling and cattle trade.Why do Left-liberal intellectuals who love to speak about Hindutva-inspired cow politics not talk about the damage inflicted by illegal cattle smuggling on farmers? Prabhu puts it well when he says that the contemporary Left has come completely unhinged.“In their lurch towards incoherent extremism, they have lost sight of their mission and are bleeding political relevance”. Truer words about the Left’s intellectual suicide were not spoken before. Shrill rhetoric, extremist language and a mission driven by hate not logic is leaving Modi unscathed and dooming the opposition in India.

**GST clears a hurdle, but tougher challenges await** 

 ______

Last Friday, the verbal slugfest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, both in the run-up to and after the meeting of the goods and services tax (GST) Council in Guwahati, all but hijacked the narrative. For any lay person, listening in on this political grandstanding, it would seem as though the entire meeting was about the slashing of GST rates for over 200 commodities and as to which of the two parties deserve the credit—understandable since the Congress has made GST, especially the glitches in its implementation, a central issue in the ongoing electoral campaign for the Gujarat assembly.

Indeed the facts of the matter, as always, are otherwise. More importantly, the political differences didn’t derail the day-long deliberations. Actually it almost did, when tempers frayed over some of the social media messages put out by some Congress politicians. But insiders reveal that finance minister Arun Jaitley intervened and appealed for calm, saying, “Politics outside (the room) is fine, but not inside.” Mercifully wisdom prevailed and the 23rd GST Council successfully preserved its unblemished consensus record.

Nonetheless the meeting provided clear signals not only to the future direction and shape of the GST but also the challenges—if unaddressed they could undermine India’s marque piece of tax reform, which has for the first time economically unified the country and unambiguously signalled its commitment to transition to a rules-based regime.

First, the plumbing has to be further fine-tuned, particularly the software support being provide by the GST Network (GSTN). As insiders reveal, it has been the biggest disappointment since GST was rolled out on 1 July, forcing the Council to make undesirable stop-gap compromises in design. A group headed by Bihar’s finance minister Sushil Modi is overseeing this and working with the vendor. Presumably an end is in sight.

Second, the massive reordering of rates undertaken in the Guwahati meeting clearly signals that a convergence of rates is underway. Contrary to erroneous claims made in some quarters of a single rate-GST based on arguments that multiple slabs were leading to chaos, it is clear that eventually (if not sooner) there will be three slabs. Haseeb Drabu, finance minister of Jammu and Kashmir, lent official confirmation, as it were, in a rare two tweets: “Till 4 months back 100s of tax rates, slabs, brackets &amp; exemptions were ok. Now 5 rates are chaotic!”

And then followed up with another: “What 5 rates. Merit, standard &amp; demerit rate is the norm. So all there is to it is collapsing 12 &amp; 18% . Will converge overtime.”

Third, the GST Council has to, at the earliest, address two issues that threaten to undermine the architecture of this indirect tax reform. It should restore the reverse charge mechanism (RCM), wherein large entities were paid the taxes on behalf of unregistered SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) on goods purchased from them. The entire idea was to widen the tax base and at the same time accelerate the formalization of the informal economy. These objectives are being defeated by any delay in restoring the RCM.

Similarly, the implementation of the e-way bill facilitating seamless inter-state transport of goods should be fast tracked. It was designed to eliminate state-wise documentation, speed up transit of goods, discourage corruption and expedite formalization of the country’s logistics network. But given the glitches in the GSTN, it was wisely decided to defer its roll-out. Now there is a lobby underway to put it on permanent hold.

Fourth, and finally, the GST Council has to figure out a way to ease the burden of compliance for the SMEs. Indira Rajaraman has argued this point very eloquently in a column published in Mint (bit.ly/2j3RjrR). Like she points out unless the systematic bias against small-scale dealers embedded in the existing GST design are not fixed it risks harming the supply chain structures and undermining the very logic of this tax reform and harming the economy. Since almost everyone in the GST Council is a politician, the members must be acutely aware that the consequences of not coming up with a speedy solution can be electorally challenging—especially for incumbent regimes.

The systematic bias against small-scale dealers embedded in its present design is harming supply chain structures and must be remedied.

In the final analysis, it is clear that the GST experiment, despite initial setbacks, is off to a good start. It is undoubtedly a work in progress. At the same time, it would be foolish to ignore the threats to it from an outdated regime. Presumably the GST Council realizes that good economics can also mean good politics.

**Modi govt plans to target barefoot entrepreneurs to boost job creation**

New Delhi: The central government has hatched a new plan to generate jobs: empower the informal economy.

Accordingly, the skills ministry proposes to reach out to tens of thousands of “barefoot entrepreneurs”, largely in the informal economy, and to train, mentor and equip them to join the formal economy and help in creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs, according to at least two government officials.

These barefoot entrepreneurs are those engaged in businesses ranging from kirana stores to tailoring shops, from roadside vendors to small business owners engaged in sundry services in smaller towns and subdivisions.

The skills ministry has identified Chhapra in Bihar to launch a pilot project.

“If 15 million of such establishments add even one more employee to their current capacity then 15 million new jobs will get created,” said a top government official, one of the two cited earlier. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.

The new approach comes at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party-National Democratic Alliance government has been targeted by the opposition—especially in the ongoing election campaign for the Gujarat assembly—for allegedly not generating enough jobs.

Nearly 30 million establishments are in the informal economy in India according to government estimates, said the two skills ministry officials cited earlier.

“The aim is to achieve scale on this. A formal scheme is being formulated for implementing this initiative,” the second of the two officials said, adding that India is a “country of entrepreneurs and helping these people at the grassroots will boost employment generation”.

On Thursday at a skills ministry event, finance minister Arun Jaitley had underlined the challenges of limited job creation capacity in the formal economy. “The strength of India’s economy will be entrepreneurship,” Jaitley said, adding that the government has to ensure that it does not “restrict the youth. We let them unleash their energy, allow them to move away from the beaten track and build new ideas for the new India.”

According to the officials cited earlier, the pilot project will not just explore establishing small businesses, but also mentor potential students from skill centres.

“If some one wants to open a cycle store, or a cloth store or a restaurant, we should be able to guide him or her. There are government schemes like Mudra from where the person can get a loan to jumpstart his business instead of working for someone and earn let’s say Rs7,000-8,000,” said the second official.

The first official said once millions of small businesses are hand-held to become self-sustainable it would expand the base for the goods and services tax and also formalize the informal economy.

“Jobs needs to be created at the place where you have candidates. Else we see this migration problem. One may argue that it won’t be called quality jobs but you have to remember that even after engineering, thousands of students are not even earning Rs15,000 a month,” this person said.

“Any effort that boosts entrepreneurship will create jobs, that’s better than a situation where the problem is, as some say right now, jobless growth,” said S. Parasuraman, director at the Tata Institute of Social Science.

**Prakash Javadekar counters unemployment claim: One crore PF accounts opened in one year**

While releasing a booklet on the BJP’s initiatives with and for youth in Ahmedabad, Javadekar also took a dig on Rahul Gandhi: “If anybody who has become unemployed in Modi’s rule, it is people like the Congress vice-president.” (Express Photo) While releasing a booklet on the BJP’s initiatives with and for youth in Ahmedabad, Javadekar also took a dig on Rahul Gandhi: “If anybody who has become unemployed in Modi’s rule, it is people like the Congress vice-president.” (Express Photo)

Countering Opposition Congress’s allegation of lack of employment under the present dispensation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday claimed that around one core new provident fund (PF) accounts were opened in the country in 2016-17.

“Ek hi ankada batata hoon…Ek saal me ek crore PF ke naye accounts shuru huye…PF ka account to koi naukri lagega tabhi shuru hoga na?…ek crore naye accounts in 2016-17. (I will give just one figure…One crore new PF accounts were opened in one year. PF account can be opened only when a person gets a job…One crore new accounts in 2016-17),” said Javadekar who was in the state to participate in BJP’s Gujarat Gaurav Maha-sampark Abhiyaan on Sunday.

Addressing a press meet in Ahmedabad, he added that attempts to provide employment to honest youths are worth taking a look. “Through one Mudra Yojana, seven crore people got employment…We have started national career portal and introduced apprenticeship programme for youths…,” Javadekar said.

He further said it was important to take note of jobs in informal and service sectors as the economy of India had changed a great deal. “Service sector ka contribution 60 per cent hain GDP me aur rojgar ke khsetra me bhi…bahot bada yogdan hain…informal sector me bahot rojgar mil raha hain (Service sector’s contribution to GDP is 60 per cent and has a large contribution in employment generation. A lot of jobs are being generated in informal sector),” Javadekar said.

While releasing a booklet on the BJP’s initiatives with and for youth in Ahmedabad, Javadekar also took a dig on Rahul Gandhi: “If anybody who has become unemployed in Modi’s rule, it is people like the Congress vice-president.” Also referring to Rahul’s promise to cap GST rates at 18 per cent if voted to power, Javadekar said the Congress vice-president intends to increase the tax burden on the common people. “I want to ask what kind of uniform tax structure he (Rahul) wants? He is advocating 18 per cent GST on all items. It means all those commodities that fall in zero, 5 or 12 per cent slabs should be charged at 18 per cent. It seems the Congress wants to increase the tax burden on people,” Javadekar said.

Rahul, who has been spearheading the Congress campaign for the next month’s Assembly polls, had said on Saturday he would not rest till the five-slab “Gabbar Singh Tax” was converted into the “Goods and Services Tax” with an 18-per cent cap.

Javadekar further said that Gujarat government (under Modi’s leadership as chief minister) had got awards for best employment generator for eight to nine years from the previous UPA government.

“Manmohanji (Singh) jab pradhan mantri the, aath saal Gujarat ko sabse jyada rojgar paida karne ke liye puraskar diya…(When Manmohanji was the prime minister, Gujarat got award for maximum employment generation for eight years…). Awards for providing maximum employment to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women were also given to Gujarat for nine years,” Javadekar said. He also said that the first draft of Union government’s Education Policy is likely to be ready by December end.

Ahmedabad/Palanpur: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said on Sunday that he and his party may criticise the Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their “mistakes”, but will not disrespect the position of the prime minister the way they did when they were in opposition.

“We may spot Modi’s faults or disturb the BJP but we won’t disrespect the PM’s position. When Modiji was in opposition he would disrespect the PM. This is the difference between us and them. No matter what Modi says about us we will not go beyond a certain point as he is our Prime Minister,” Gandhi said while interacting with the social media volunteers of the Congress at Ambaji in Banaskantha district of North Gujarat. He is in Gujarat for the fourth phase of Congress’s Navsarjan Yatra ahead of the state elections in December.

Gandhi’s social media presence has become a topic of discussion lately, especially after he tweeted a video of his dog Pidi.

To a question on the reason behind his large Twitter following, Gandhi said, “I said it is Pidi who tweets…the political tweets are mine but the routine ones like birthday wishes are posted by my team.”

Gandhi said that Congress believes in self-introspection and self-improvement and unlike the BJP does not blame others for its own faults.

“Demonetisation and GST (goods and services tax) implementation were whose faults? They were Modiji’s mistakes. But did he even once accept that he made a mistake? Reality is that everyone commits a mistake be it a politician or a social media worker. But one must accept a mistake and move on. This is the difference between them and us,” he added.

Later in the day while addressing an election rally in Banaskantha, Gandhi said that the popular sentiment among the people is that government should curtail GST on most commonly used items and control inflation by bringing petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders under GST in a uniform rate which should not be more than 18%.

The Congress vice president visited Palanpur as well where he targeted Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani over the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) slapping fine on his firm for alleged manipulative share trade, and asked the prime minister to speak out on the issue.

Gandhi claimed that Sebi has termed Rupani “beimaan” (dishonest) and imposed the fine on him. Gandhi asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak out against his “dishonest” chief minister. “Gujarat is more corrupt than the entire country. Surat businessmen told me that policemen come to their units every two minutes (allegedly to demand bribe),” he said.

“Some days ago, Sebi said your chief minister is beimaan (dishonest) and they fined him. “Modiji used to say ‘na khaoonga, na khane doonga’ (I will neither take bribe nor allow others to take bribe). Please open your mouth on this subject now. But he is silent. Now his slogan is ‘na bolta hu, na bolne dunga’ (Neither do I speak nor do I allow others to speak),” Gandhi said. “Jay Shah, son of (BJP chief) Amit Shah, increased the turnover of his company from Rs50,000 to Rs80 crore in a few months after the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) came to power in 2014. The people of Gujarat know this cannot be done without corruption,” he added.

“The people of the country want to listen what you (Modi) have to say on Amit Shah’s son’s company, on Vijay Rupani. The people of Gujarat will believe that you are not ‘chowkidar’ (watchman) but ‘bhagidar’ (collaborator) if you don’t say anything on the issue.”

The Congress vice-president began his three-day tour on Saturday by visiting the famous Akshardham Temple of the Swaminarayan Sect that has a huge following of the Patel community, and followed it up with a visit to the Ambaji temple on Sunday.

PTI in Palanpur, Gujarat, contributed to this story.

**Over 60% housing projects in 50 cities delayed: Survey** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: At least 62% of under-construction housing projects across 50 cities are delayed, while the percentage for delayed flats/apartments stands slightly higher at 64%, recent analysis by a real estate research firm has found.According to data accessed by 'Fight for RERA ', the umbrella body of flat buyers, from research firm Liases Forras , nearly 30% of underconstruction apartments are delayed by two or more years.""Flats or houses delayed by over two years include huge numbers where work has been going on for more than four-five years. RERA ( has been aimed at bringing relief to buyers of incomplete projects,"" said Abhay Upadhyay , president of the flat buyers' body. ""The Real Estate Regulation Act is also aimed at ensuring new projects don't get delayed,"" he added.The central government had recently informed the Bombay high court that in Maharashtra alone, 5.3 lakh apartments in under-construction projects were delayed, and that more than one-fifth of these were delayed by more than three years. The court had asked the housing and urban development ministry to provide details and the number of delayed projects.The Bombay HC is holding daily hearing of cases filed by real estate developers challenging RERA and seeking to keep incomplete projects out of the central law.The court is likely to pronounce judgment soon. Though the housing ministry had been working on a real estate regulation law for more than eight years, it did not have any official data about the number of delayed projects and houses.But now, with the real estate regulator in each state hosting project details online, consolidated data at the national level will be available soon.The real estate law was first proposed by the UPA government, and passed by the NDA government, with the aim of bringing relief to lakhs of homebuyers waiting endlessly for houses despite investing their life savings.Earlier this year, Fight for RERA had appealed to the Centre to start collecting data on all incomplete projects across India and track the number of homebuyers in these projects.""The projects should be categorised as normal and high-risk and, accordingly, steps should be taken by your government in high-risk projects so as to safeguard the interest of homebuyers in these projects,"" it had written to PM Narendra Modi

**Yashwant bats for quota in private jobs** 

 ______ 
PATNA: Former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha on Friday favoured reservation in private sector jobs and also pitched for increasing the quota slab from the existing 50% to higher side in government jobs.Sinha, who in 2002 introduced corporate social responsibility (CSR), said, ""If the corporates have any objection to it, they should spell out the reasons for that.""He said the Centre should constitute a commission to study and assess the transformation that had occurred due to application of job reservation in government sector, apart from pointing to the shortcomings in the implementation of the quota policy, including for the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST) and other backward class (OBC) people.""Now even the Centre has also started talking about reservation for the extremely backward classes (EBCs). It means that there was some problem with the implementation of the quota policy,"" Sinha said.Addressing a function organized here by Vanchit Varg Morcha (VVM) headed by former Bihar assembly Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary, Sinha said, ""The growth of economy is a must for reaching out benefits to weaker sections, but the recent developments have also impacted people negatively. The demonetisation done last year not only led to fall in the GDP growth rate, but also resulted in loss of 20 lakh jobs.""VVM, in principle, stands as umbrella organization for the deprived sections of the society.Earlier, Choudhary described the grim conditions facing the deprived sections, like homelessness, increase in atrocities on dalits, their preponderance among jail inmates, incidents of rape, abolition of scholarship for students, introduction of credit card for loans from banks for higher studies, annulment of reservation in promotion, backlogs of unfilled reserved posts, lack of reservation in judiciary. He assailed the policies pursued by PM Narendra Modi Choudhary, who is still in the JD(U) and has fallen out with its president cum state CM Nitish Kumar , also assailed Nitish for his belated announcement of quota in outsourced jobs, even as the law regarding it had been existing since 1993.In the same vein, he criticised the death of children in the government hospitals for want of oxygen in Uttar Pradesh where, he said, Rs500 crore was spent on the celebration of Ram and Sita. ""In their eyes, human lives have no value,"" he said.Sinha had been principal secretary to former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur, a popular leader from an EBC group. He asked Choudhary to gather together intellectuals, including Sachindra Narayan, who also addressed the function, to prepare a white paper on the condition of weaker/deprived sections.

**In India, fashion has become a nationalist cause** 

 ______ 
During the last two decades luxury brands have eyed India’s fast-moving economy, booming middle class and youthful population, already among the world’s largest, hoping they had discovered their next big market. But it was not to be.Along with India’s protectionist policies (talks with the European Union on a free-trade agreement have been stalled since 2007), the rise of Hindu nationalist politics has become a major obstacle to realizing the country’s promise of growth.Since the Bharatiya Janata Party formed a national government in 2014, the Indian fashion industry has been pressed to aggressively promote traditional attire and bypass Western styles. The effort aligns with the party’s broader political program: to project multi-faith India, a country of more than 1.3 billion, as a Hindu nation.Fashion, and how Indians think of it, has not been exempt. PM Modi has made traditional dress a priority and, as many in the country want to please him, the fashion industry has followed along.“There is a clear connection between the rising Hindu nationalism and the aesthetic production of leading Indian fashion designers and the country’s luxury industry at large,” said Tereza Kuldova, a social anthropologist and author of the 2016 book “Luxury Indian Fashion: A Social Critique.” “Aesthetic production has an uncanny tendency to materialize ideological currents in any given society.”Modi’s effort to restore Indian-ness in Indian fashion began with his Make in India campaign, announced just months after he took office. The initiative to encourage local manufacturing was initially led by an urbane party politician and fashion designer from Mumbai, Shaina Nana Chudasama, popularly known by her nickname of Shaina NC.And in August 2015, Chudasama introduced what she called the Banarasi Textiles Revival Movement at a fashion exhibition in Mumbai.The exhibition, which brought together the work of some of the country’s leading fashion designers including Anita Dongre and Manish Malhotra, was organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Textiles and intended to promote the Banarasi sari, the traditional garment known for its fine silk and opulent embroidery — and primarily worn by Hindu women. Since then, there have been frequent state-sponsored fashion shows and exhibitions, most recently the “Symphony of Weaves,” a fashion showcase for the country’s textiles, held in July in Gujarat, all with the aim of promoting traditional Indian clothing styles.India’s leaders have always made political use of traditional clothing, from Mohandas K. Gandhi’s adoption of the dhoti to Jawaharlal Nehru’s jacket. But active state intervention and patronage of the fashion industry have never before reached this scale.“A subtle current of Indianizing the fashion was already there, but now, with the government’s backing, it has gained a new momentum,” said David Abraham, one of the country’s leading designers and the creative director of Abraham &amp; Thakore, the New Delhi-based fashion label.The Banarasi sari is woven in the northern Indian city of Varanasi, formerly called Benares or Banaras, which happens to be Modi’s political constituency. It is also one of the holiest cities for Hindus, who consider it the eternal home of Lord Shiva, the Supreme God.For Hindus, the city’s ghats — flights of stone steps along the banks of the Ganges — are the site of liberation, or moksha, from the sins that afflict them in the earthly drama of life. Hours after Modi was elected prime minister, that was where he went to thank the voters. “God has chosen me,” he announced amid the chanting of hymns and “Har Har Modi,” a campaign adaptation of “Har Har Mahadev” (“Everyone is Lord Shiva”).During his campaign, Modi had promised to revive the tradition of the Banarasi sari and to help its weavers, a significant percentage of the constituency’s electorate. The weavers, who are mostly Muslim and following a family trade, largely live in poverty.In late October, I visited Varanasi to learn whether anything had changed in the three years since Modi came to power.Mohammad Bashir, a wiry middle-age man who was my guide, led me through the narrow alleys of Saraiya, a village about 10 miles from the city. There were open drains clogged with thick black sewage, and half-dressed children played nearby.As soon as we reached what looked like a community center, about 50 men, old and young, gathered around. A few told their stories on behalf of the group: Nothing had changed for them.“We can’t send our children to school,” said Mohammad Yusuf, who, in his mid-50s, was one of the older weavers. “The fee is too much. Each family earns about 100 rupees to 125 rupees ($1.55-$1.95) a day.”But Modi’s call to revive the Banarasi sari certainly has benefited the merchants in the city, who employ the weavers. “The demand for the luxury sari has gone up,” said Hemang Agrawal, creative director of the Surekha Group and a businessman based in Varanasi.The project of Indianizing popular fashion is now in the hands of the country’s textile minister, Smriti Irani, who was appointed in July 2016.As personalities, both Modi and Irani have contributed to the cause. Modi’s choice of colorful kurtas — a tunic shirt with half-length sleeves — and Irani’s saris have become popular fashion statements. Before becoming a politician, Irani was a household name as a soap opera star. Tulsi, the character she played in “Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi” (“Because the Mother-in-Law Was Once a Daughter-in-Law”), popularized her as a traditional Indian daughter-in-law draped in sari.The government’s aim certainly has been to produce a popular fashion aesthetic that matches the broader political program of Hindu nationalism. But the world is more open to cultural change than it ever has been before, so will that effort ultimately succeed?Only time will tell.

**A year into demonetisation, big data new weapon in fight against black money**

Demonetisation, and now GST, has resulted in higher personal income tax filings. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

New Delhi: Income tax officers last week searched the house of a financial brokerage firm’s founders in Jaipur and a private locker, seizing Rs3.5 crore. The promoters admitted to previously untaxed income of Rs15 crore.

In a similar search in the first week of October at a Gurugram-based auto-components maker, tax officials unearthed Rs8 crore in cash from the promoter’s home and 40 kilogrammes of gold and several diamonds from a private locker.

These searches and many other similar raids had one thing in common—the rich prefer to hide their wealth in private vaults, mostly under the names of others, said a tax official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

What led the tax sleuths to the precise location of the hidden wealth was intensive mining of data on cash withdrawals sourced from banks and transaction details of gold merchants followed by months of careful observation of the suspected tax evaders.

In one case, a tax official worked as the servant of a suspect at his residence for months before the search team finally moved in for the kill.

That approach, leveraging reams of data generated after last November’s demonetisation, has served the department well in making its search and enforcement operations more precise, said the official cited above.

“We have been able to cut down the number of cases chosen for scrutiny drastically. Only less than 0.5% of tax returns filed in assessment year 2016-17 (relating to income for financial year 2015-16) have been chosen for scrutiny, compared to about 1% of returns in the previous years. The tax department is reposing more faith in the assessees,” said the official.

After last November’s high-value currency ban aimed at striking at the root of unaccounted wealth generated in the past, the income tax department stepped up its data mining exercise under ‘Operation Clean Money’ in January.

The current effort is to profile those who deposited high amounts of cash in light of their tax payment track record and lifestyle. The department’s drive to get permanent account numbers used in tax filings with Aadhaar, the biometric identification number, is meant to make such profiling more effective.

“Many partners in firms and directors on the boards of companies use luxury cars but disclose far less income than an ordinary government or private sector employee. In such cases, everything from the car, the house, services of servants and the chauffer will be in the name of the company, which may be sinking and therefore not be paying corporate tax. The partner or the director, at the same time, prospers,” said the official quoted above.

According to Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader at EY India, there has been a sea change in the tax administration, especially after demonetisation and launch of ‘Operation Clean Money’.

Digital processing of personal income tax returns and swift refunds has resulted in very minimal physical interface between the taxman and the assessee, he said.

“This almost ‘ silent’ revolution has largely gone unnoticed but those tax payers who have experienced dealing with tax departments in the ‘pre-digital’ age have been pleasantly surprised by this transformation brought about by embrace of technology,” said Kapadia.

Data mining is now increasingly being done with help from outside experts under an initiative called ‘project insight’.

The Narendra Modi administration, which came to power in 2014 on the promise of minimizing generation of unaccounted wealth and tracking down black money stashed in foreign banks, set up a special investigation team in its first month in office to oversee the effort.

Since then, it enacted the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) Imposition of Tax Act in 2015 to penalize concealment of wealth abroad, amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in 2015 to attach domestic property equivalent to any proceeds of crime funnelled out of the country and enacted a Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act in 2016 to modify the original 1988 law to confiscate property held by proxies and prosecute the offenders.

The finance ministry also took a series of steps to curb the flow of tax-evaded funds out of the country re-entering Indian shores in the guise of foreign direct investment through companies set up in countries with which India has tax avoidance treaties.

That include renegotiating the double tax avoidance agreement with Mauritius, a major foreign direct investment (FDI) source, enabling taxation of capital gains in India on investments made by Mauritius entities.

Abhishek A. Rastogi, partner, Khaitan &amp; Co., said most reformative steps tend to be intrusive especially as people move out of traditional comfort zones.

“Both demonetisation and goods and service tax (GST) will certainly have positive impact on the economy in the long run as leakages would be tracked and traced,” said Rastogi.

The indirect tax reform of GST, rolled out on 1 July, is also expected to bring more of the cash-driven informal economy into the formal economy, resulting in higher personal income tax filings.

According to Archit Gupta, chief executive of ClearTax, a taxpayer service firm, the real effects of GST on direct taxes will surface when income tax returns for financial year 2017-18 are submitted.

“We believe the government has displayed commitment in bringing out reforms to the benefit of taxpayers as well in reviewing them wherever they were challenging,” said Gupta.

Kapadia of EY said the key challenge for the tax administration is to ensure that all the analysis is done at the back end with minimum disruption to the tax payer. “Care should be taken to solicit specific, precise and relevant information from the tax payer and not conduct a ‘ fishing inquiry’,” he said.

If someone supports the BJP, they are inadvertently supporting the regressive ideology too. If they do so without knowledge of the ideology, it would be their fault really.

A metropolitan court in Ahmedabad on Monday adjourned the hearing in the defamation case filed by Jay Shah, son of BJP national president Amit Shah, against news portal The Wire to December 16. The adjournment came after Jay Shah, through his advocate, sought exemption from appearance in court for a day on the ground of social engagement.

The Wire’s editors, reporters and others were present in the court for the hearing.

An Ahmedabad court had last month passed an order barring The Wire from publishing any further report on Jay Shah’s business turnover “so that the right to live with dignity of the plaintiff (Jay) may be protected”.

Additional Senior Civil Judge B K Dasondi of Ahmedabad rural court had observed that the “injunction should be granted to applicant/plaintiff (Jay)” even though notice was not served upon the opposite parties (The Wire, its editor, the writer of the article, and others).

On October 8, The Wire had published a report stating, among other things, that the turnover of a company owned by (Amit) Shah’s son increased 16,000 times in the year following election of Narendra Modi.

The order stated, “This court is of the opinion that if the application (of Jay) is not allowed, then it may lead to prejudice with the rights and interest of the applicant.”

In his order, the judge had prohibited the website from “using and publishing or printing in any electronic, print, digital or any other media, or broadcast, telecast, print and publish… in any language on the basis of article published in “The Wire” dated 8/10/17 either directly or indirectly on the subject matter with respect to plaintiff in any manner whatsoever”.

The court directed Jay to “deliver to the opposite parties (The Wire) a copy of application”. The order was passed on October 12 on a civil suit and damage for Rs 100 crore, filed by Jay against The Wire.

**'Am In Delhi, Where's The Meeting?' Haryana's ML Khattar Takes On Arvind Kejriwal** 

 ______ 
Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar advised Arvind Kejriwal to ""rise above vote-
bank politics"". (file)

**Chandigarh: **

After his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh called him a ""peculiar person,""
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has drawn criticism from Haryana's
Manohar Lal Khattar, who has accused him of ""pollution politics"" and advised
him to ""rise above vote-bank politics.

Arvind Kejriwal has blamed thick, toxic smog enveloping the national capital

mainly on farmers burning crop stubble in Punjab and Haryana to clear fields
for the next sowing season. He said he had written to the chief ministers of
both states to put their heads together to find a solution, but had not been
given an appointment by either.

""I will be in Delhi on Monday and Tuesday. There is no response from your
office on meeting,"" countered Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar in his reply
to Mr Kejriwal, also asking, ""There are 40,000 farmers in Delhi. What are you
doing about them?""

Arvind Kejriwal has blamed Delhi air pollution mainly on farm fires in Punjab
and Haryana (file)

Every winter as farmers burn crop stubble, the smoke travels towards Delhi and
mixes with other pollutants to cover the capital with a deadly grey smog.
Schools had to be shut down last week as the Delhi government scrambled to
find solutions to the spike in pollution.

""We have taken all possible steps in Haryana. We have also requested people
burning stubble to not do so,"" Mr Khattar said, alleging that Punjab is the
bigger culprit. He said that while the neighbouring state had not used ""a
penny out of 98 crores allotted to check farm fires, Haryana used 39 crores
out of 45 crores allotted"" to it for the purpose.

Arvind Kejriwal ""has his own viewpoints on everything without understanding
the situation,"" Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had said last week after
Mr Kejriwal suggested that the Punjab and Haryana governments rise above
politics and help solve Delhi's air quality emergency.

""If I have got 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, if I ask the farmer to store
this, farms will be covered with the paddy straw.

Mr Kejriwal doesn't understand this problem,""

the Punjab Chief Minister had said.

Amarinder Singh holds that the meeting of chief ministers suggested by Arvind
Kejriwal will serve no purpose. He said he had requested Prime Minister
Narendra Modi to convene meeting of Chief Ministers of affected states along
with union ministers since the Centre's role was crucial in finding a solution
in an interstate matter.

Mr Kejriwal has said using force will not help end the farm burning problem in
Punjab and Haryana. ""It's an economic problem. Unless the governments there
don't find economically viable alternatives, this won't stop,"" the Delhi Chief
Minister has said.

&gt; According to top sources in the party, 30 senior leaders will descend on the state on a single day, visiting a multitude of constituencies, in a **show of strength that’s designed to convince voters to support the Modi model yet again**.

&gt; The date for this **political carpet bombing** hasn’t been finalised yet, but is expected to be around 25 November.

&gt; The list of ministers is expected to include **Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani, Nitin Gadkari, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Prakash Javadekar. The list of chief ministers is expected to feature Yogi Adityanath, Vasundhara Raje, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Devendra Fadnavis, Raman Singh, and Manohar Lal Khattar**.

&gt; the Gujarat polls are especially important as the state is home to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, and was **their political laboratory between 2001 and 2014**.

&gt;  In addition to the planned blitzkrieg of ministers, the party is also running a Jan Sampark Abhiyaan or a door-to-door campaign.

&gt; The importance of the election can be gauged from the fact that the **BJP has put Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in charge of its preparations, assisted by four central ministers – defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, rural development and mining minister Narendra Singh Tomar, PMO MoS Jitendra Singh, and law and justice MoS P.P.

In his detailed reply on Quora - replete with infographs - Goyal said the Bullet Train project will help the Indian Railways ""revolutionise every passenger's journey"". And the project, he said, ""will help the nation and Railways grow in many ways.""

**Government rolls out BharatNet Phase 2, aims 100% connectivity by 2020** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The second phase of BharatNet project with an outlay of Rs 31,000 crore and a mandate to provide high-speed broadband to all panchayats by March 2019 got off the block today.



Additionally, the Department of Telecom requested all states to provide a list of unconnected villages so that all of them can be connected with telecom services by 2020.



Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha, along with Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi were present at the launch of the second phase of the project.



""Under the project, we will provide 1 gbps (gigabuit per second) bandwidth capacity at panchayat level. The Cabinet in July 2017 approved a modified implementation strategy for BharatNet which include...project completion for all 2.5 lakh panchayats by March 2019,"" Sinha said at the launch.



The telecom ministry expects to complete the first phase of the project covering over 1 lakh panchayats by the end of December. As per official data, broadband services have already been started in more than 48,000 panchayats and over 75,000 panchayats are ready for the services.



""The progress of service readiness has picked up to such an extent that in October 2017 around 25,000 gram panchayats have already been made service ready. All 1 lakh panchayats under first phase will be ready for broadband by the end of December,"" Sinha said.



Javadekar said that broadband connectivity in all panchayats will be key growth enabler specially in the field of education.



""We want to bring revolution in schools, like there was operation blackboard in 1970s. We are now dreaming of digital board and the connectivity (through BharatNet) will transform entire nation,"" he said.



Prasad suggested that all government offices should be connected with BharatNet.



The project, then called the National Optical Fibre Network, was approved by the previous UPA government in October 2011. However, only about three hundred kilometres out of 3 lakh kilometres of optical fibre were laid across the country, Sinha said.



""When it was launched previously it was actually no fun for any one. Little or no progress had been made...Ever since I have taken charge, I have personally been invested in this project and have made sure that all the updated timelines are met,"" he added.



The total project cost is around Rs 42,000 crore of which around Rs 11,000 crore have been invested in the first phase.



Under the phase 2, the government aims to connect 1.5 lakh panchayats through 10 lakh kilometres of additional optical fibre and give bandwidth to telecom players at nearly 75 per cent cheaper price for broadband and wifi services in rural areas.



Reliance Jio paid the highest advance subscription fee of Rs 13 crore to provide broadband services at 30,000 gram panchayats, with a commitment to buy bandwidth in every panchayat from the government as it expands the project.



Bharti Airtel shelled out Rs 5 crore for bandwidth buy to cover 30,500 village panchayats, Vodafone Rs 11 lakh and Idea Cellular Rs 5 lakh.



The government signed agreement with seven states -- Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand -- which will roll out the project on their own with partial funding from the central government. The Centre will provide total fund support of around Rs 10,000 crore to the state governments.



Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan further asked state government to send list of unconnected villages in their jurisdiction so that all of them can be connected by 2020.

137,"&gt; **He was doing something that defied reason**, but yet he appeared confident that the demonetisation—let us call it “DeMon” for short, given that Modi has a definite proclivity to unleash demons—would render the notes hoarded by all the seasoned dealers in black money “just worthless pieces of paper.” **Those seasoned dealers, Modi surely knew, clever in the ways of business and politics, would soon resort to jugaad (unauthorised workarounds) to get most of their black money back into the legal banking system**.


&gt; What then were the government and the BJP celebrating on 8 November this year? **The fact that over a hundred persons lost their lives standing in serpentine queues, waiting endlessly to hand in their demonetised notes, and hoping to get hold of the new ones? The event wherein a number of people had to bear the agony of the possible loss of their near and dear ones in want of cash to pay for urgent medical emergency procedures? The happening, of casual labourers being compelled to accept their wages in the demonetised currency and then having to “travel to the nearest bank and stand in lines to exchange the notes or have them exchanged at a discount through commission agents”?** The truth that in northern India, “after difficulties with the marketing of the kharif crop, a fresh round of difficulties emerged with sowing of the rabi crop”? **All the distress and despair that the DeMon decision brought upon the common people are related with a rare sensitivity and empathy by our former colleague C Rammanohar Reddy in his recent book Demonetisation and Black Money** (Orient BlackSwan, 2017).


&gt; **For what one might ask was this subjection of hundreds of millions of people to so much suffering and indignity, and even many deaths? Just 1% of the demonetised currency has not returned to the banking system, and even here, not all of this can be presumed to be black money. Only about 5% of the estimated counterfeit currency has been removed by DeMon. Clearly, DeMon, in terms of its officially stated objectives, has been a miserable failure**. The question, however, remains as to why there were few, if any, organised protests and demonstrations in the wake of the infliction of so much distress and suffering.

&gt; **Clearly, it is yet to be widely realised that the transfer of power from the British colonial rulers put the now predatory, lumpen Indian ruling classes in power, with little basic systemic change. Therefore, the struggle for economic freedom requires a revolutionary movement against these ruling classes, as also against the lumpen “political class” that plays the role of a broker for the particular interests of powerful groups within the system**.


&gt; **The BJP’s Hindutva-nationalist lie, which allows the “anti-nation within the nation”—the Indian ruling classes and their political brokers—to ride roughshod over the people, needs to be exposed. Modi’s exhortation in the name of nationalism, indeed, patriotism—its Hindu variant now the opium of a majority—still seems to work its magic and gets that majority high on patriotic feelings. The truth, however, needs to get across: the black economy (and black money) is an integral part of predatory Indian capitalism**; the only way of getting rid of it and the bigger demon of which it is a part, is class struggle against the “anti-nation within the nation”—the Indian ruling classes and their political brokers.",2017-11-14 14:05:38

**Gujarat elections: Amit Shah’s strategy for BJP focuses on poll day mobilisation** 

 ______ 
“I don’t need to tell you what to do. We have been doing this in Gujarat. Gujarat has, in fact, taught the rest of the country. We have to do it again.”

When BJP chief Amit Shah met party workers from Surat district last week, he listened to their feedback; he asked them to faithfully implement the programmes set out by the party -- particularly jan sampark, mass contact; he reiterated the importance of party sangathan, structure, at all units in mobilising voters on polling day; and he offered only one new instruction:

“I want all of you - Shakti Kendra in charge, booth committee members, page presidents, active members - and your families to vote before 10.30am on polling day. Finish your own duty by then. And then you spend the rest of the day in mobilising others.”

As Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi continues with his public rallies in Gujarat, Shah’s public appearances have been few and far between. Instead, he has been busy addressing internal party gatherings with only objective in mind -- poll day logistics and mobilisation.

On Sunday, he met the chiefs of ‘Shakti Kendras’-- an organisational unit comprising a few booths -- in Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Patan and Banaskantha. Late last week, he met workers from Vadodara and Chota Udaipur of central Gujarat. And before that, he managed a quick trip to Jamnagar. On Thursday, he was with workers of Surat and Tapi district in south Gujarat.

But what are these workers on the ground expected to do? HT met the heads of Shakti Kendras, booth committees, and electoral roll (panna) presidents in Surat’s Majaura constituency to understand the mechanics of Shah’s work from the ground up.

Machine on the ground

At Parle Point, Gujarat’s youngest MLA in the last assembly, the 32-year-old Harsh Sanghavi, has set up his campaign office-cum-call centre on the ground floor of a high-rise apartment. The constituency has a substantial Jain and Marwari population and Patidar voters -- the party’s disgruntled core base. But to offset any anti incumbency, a robust organisation is at work.

A group of men sit around in a large room. Majura has 243,000 voters; 243 booths; and 67 Shakti Kendras. The party also has 5,834 page presidents in this single constituency.

Mukhesh Pujara, a ward president, explains their role. “A panna pramukh usually has 47 or 48 people on his roll. We ask a party sympathiser to take over the role, and we tell them that they basically have to get these voters out on polling day. The pramukh is from the same area and knows most people or is meant to establish contact earlier. He is usually not an active worker - since party workers would be doing this anyway.” While they had a system like this in earlier elections too, this time around, the page presidents have been appointed in advance, and they are in regular contact.

These pramukhs would be in touch with their booth committees. Depending on the size of the booth, the party has a 13, 18, or 25 member committee for each of the 243 booths - with a minimum of three, four or five women representatives respectively. The committee is also supposed to have SC/ST/OBC representatives. “These committees are not born just for elections. They are in operation. The booth committee organises festivals, celebrates party’s anniversaries, birthdays of our leaders, and each active member of the booth has enrolled 25 other active members. So this is a vibrant unit.”

And these booth committees then constitute a Shakti Kendra. These units coordinate across a larger area, report to the campaign office, and play a monitoring role. They also have social media in charge of each Shakti Kendra. “We have WhatsApp groups at each level, and for different social groups,” says Himanshu Raulji, a Shakti Kendra in-charge.

Besides this existing structure, party workers called Vistaraks have already visited each booth twice- they are from another area. Pujara says, “I went to another ward in May-June to understand their sentiments, assess the situation and then I went back in October and gave my report accordingly.”

What was the difference? He candidly admits, “Earlier, GST was not an issue. In October, some voters told us that ‘we are for the party but have problems with the process’. We conveyed this feedback and as rules have got simplified, the mood has become more positive.” Another party worker adds that the difference in this campaign is the focus on mass contact. “There is a false narrative to create negative sentiment. The only way to counter is it through consistent contact. That is what Amit bhai has told us.”

A call centre at work

Next to the meeting hall, a group of young men and women have mobiles connected to the charging station, pages with names on their desk, and voices can be heard as each of them speak on the phone.

Paresh, one of the volunteers, says, “I call up a number, ask whether I am speaking to the voter listed out on my page. I then introduce myself as a BJP worker, ask if they have their voter IDs and Aadhaar. I then ask them to support BJP in the elections.” By the end of the campaign, each voter of Majura would have received close to five calls from the centre. Another volunteer adds, “Sometimes, they complain. One voter said he was very harassed because of GST. I convey that to leaders.” And in case of voters who have turned antagonistic or have concerns, more senior leaders or the MLA candidate himself would then speak to them directly.

The party has collected this rich data of numbers -- through the primary membership drive initiated by Amit Shah soon after he became president; through an independent agency commissioned by Sanghavi to get numbers of members of each household; online data crunching; and by carefully collecting the numbers of all those whose work was mediated by the MLA and the party in the preceding five years.

Raulji, the Shakti Kendra in-charge, believes this sangathan gives the BJP an edge during elections. “Before every election, we hear it is neck and neck because Congress wakes up only four months before the contest. The outcome is the same each time because they go back to sleep for four and a half years after that. Our work will continue after December 18 too.”

Amit Shah is oiling this machine, as Gujarat’s BJP waits for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to return to the state to begin his final offensive ahead of the December elections.

140,"They (a majority) kept voting for Modi, not despite, but because of 2002. Development has been a side dish. Nothing has changed. They will again vote for Modi.

Fot those saying that BJP will win because there is no strong opposition, remember this 'weak opposition' has forced the 'strongest PM' to reduce GST on all items that matter to Gujus, waived off KYC for gold purchases, is delaying parliament's winter session, is resorting to cheap tricks like Hardik Patel's sex CD and has deployed not just himself, but also several cabinet ministers and BJP chief ministers for the campaign.

**Ujjwala: The nudge story** 

 ______

The elegance, and genius, of the nudge theory lies in its ability to render decipherable aspects of praxis—that have been employed by individuals, governments and private institutions alike for decades.

Richard Thaler—co-proponent of the theory who won the Nobel Prize in economics this year—shows how positive reinforcements and indirect suggestions engender compliance to influence incentives and decision-making of groups and individuals while emphasizing free choice—nudges cannot be mandates.

Though there has been much deliberation on nudges, one government scheme in India that has not got its deserved attention in this context is the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. Its prolific success in terms of getting new liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to the poorest households in the country—from 87 lakh (8.7 million) in 2014 to 483 lakh (48.3 million) in 2017—can only be attributed to quintessential Thaler-ian nudging.

Nudge theory elaborates a plot of heuristics, many of which have been employed along the length of the supply chain under the Ujjwala scheme.

Behavioural psychology distinguishes between intuitive and deliberative behaviour. ‘Nudgists’ believe that the following are some of the prominent strategies to influence “natural” assessment (intuitive behaviour).

First is the availability heuristic—that if something is heard or seen a lot then people start questioning it less. The most obvious tool through which this is done is the mass media. The Ujjwala scheme held 50,000 safety camps in 545 days, says K.M. Mahesh, deputy secretary (LPG) at the ministry of petroleum and natural gas (MoPNG). Advertisements, videos, pamphlets and the so-called LPG panchayats have proven to be highly effective in countering commonly held misperceptions.

Additionally, another important aspect to consider for effective nudging is to understand how something is perceived in relation to a stereotype or assumption. For instance, in a village I mapped some families said that before they started using LPG they believed that cooking through biomass is better for digestion. They are partially convinced of the falseness of the assumption through attending LPG safety camps held in the village.

For a below poverty line (BPL) family, getting a LPG connection, though aspirational in many ways, was an inaccessible thought given the costs involved. By giving the nudge of interest-free loans, being pro-active and reaching the doorstep of the customer rather than waiting for the marginalized families to negotiate their way through a maze of procedures, the ministry made the possibility of a BPL woman owning a LPG cylinder accessible for the potential beneficiaries of the scheme. That nudged the popular imagination of the economically deprived section of society.

Much behavioural work considers that there is a tendency of human beings to be loss averse and maintaining status quo for the fear of the unknown. Such aversions are being combatted through safety guideline posters with pictorial depictions that are mandatorily hung over the gas stove at the eye’s level. The planned exercise of MoPNG to conduct one lakh LPG panchayats in a little over 400 days will, presumably, also be strong nudge towards achieving the government’s target of 5 crore (50 million) connections by 2019.

However, the nudges have been given not only to the demand side but also to the suppliers to complete the circuit of nudging, so to speak.

The district nodal officers (DNOs) of the OMCs were promised recognition and an award based on certain criteria. The first such award function was held in Lucknow where 39 DNOs were awarded.

Significantly, DNOs had videoconferences with executive directors of the OMCs, state LPG heads, senior officials at the MoPNG and, occasionally, the minister of MoPNG, Dharmendra Pradhan. Such direct exchanges provided a huge morale boost to employees who would otherwise not have a chance to interact with their top bosses.

Additionally, every DNO was asked to have a social media account uploading photographs—this was the first time that employees apart from corporate communication officers were allowed to interact with the press. The DNOs frequently tag Pradhan and top officials of MoPNG showcasing their work, who in turn often respond encouragingly. Not only did this cut through the red tape but it also devised a crucial feedback system for achieving the targets for new LPG connections. Sustaining the nudges and devising newer ways is a necessary condition to make the full transition to clean fuel for the country.

The unfolding story of Ujjwala emphasizes the salience of relatively small and contextual changes that re-wire choices and motivations, and not sacks of money, that ensure the success of a social project. Therein may lie some solutions to the overwhelming and seemingly intractable problem of global poverty.

**Secular word is ‘biggest lie’, says UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath** 

 ______ 
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday the word ‘secular’ was the ‘biggest lie’ told after India gained independence and the people responsible for using the word should apologise for it.

Adityanath was speaking at a function organised by the Dainik Jagran group in Raipur, Chhattisgarh , and was responding to a question on communalism and secularism. He also said that any distortion” of history is akin to sedition.

Speaking in Hindi, Adityanath said, “Mera maanna hai ki azadi ke baad Bharat mein sabse bada jhooth dharmnirpeksh shabd hai. Nagrikon ke saath, Bharat ke logon ke saath… un logon ko maafi maangni chahiye, jinhone is shabd ko janm diya aur jo yeh shabd istemaal karte hai… koi vyavastha dharmnirpeksh nahin ho sakti. Rajneetik vyavastha panthnirpeksh ho sakti hai,” the Indian Express reported. (“I believe that after Independence, the biggest lie in India is the word secular...the people who gave birth to this word and who use it, should apologise. No system can be secular. Political systems can be neutral towards sects, but not secular.”)

The word ‘secular’ is included in the Preamble to India’s constitution, which strives to make the country a “soveriegn, socialist, secular, democratic republic”.

Congress leader Kapil Sibal had a reply for the monk-turned-politician, dubbing his statement the “biggest lie” instead.

Yogi Adityanath says "" secularism is a lie "" and compares Modi's government to "" Ram Rajya "".



This "" Truth "" is perhaps the biggest lie . — Kapil Sibal (@KapilSibal) November 14, 2017

Adityanath took a dig at neighbouring Pakistan saying that the words “Pakistan” and “Paki” were considered derogatory in Europe. ”Pakistan has become synonymous with a word of abuse,” he said. .

Earlier in the day, addressing a convention of BJP workers at the Balbir Singh Juneja Indoor Stadium, Adityanath accused the Congress of playing with the sentiments of the people and dividing them on the basis of caste, region and language for its vested interest.

“It practised politics of appeasement for political gains and gave birth to scourge of terrorism, Naxalism and separatism. The country is still paying the price (for its policies),” the BJP leader said.

Adityanath said if the grand old party had acted responsibly, the country would not been facing so many problems.

“If the Congress leadership had discharged its duties, the country would not have been grappling with starvation and lack of health facilities. If anyone is responsible for the country’s mismanagement, it is the 55-year rule of the Congress,” the UP chief minister said.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government in states are making efforts to tackle such problems and take the country on the path of development.

**'Like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat Election Is About Nationalism:' Chief Minister Vijay Rupani** 

 ______ 
Gujarat Assembly Elections 2017: Vijay Rupani and team have been tasked by
Amit Shah to win 150 seats.

**Gandhinagar: **

The Gujarat election is about

_ rashtravaad _

(nationalism) for the BJP, much as the Uttar Pradesh election was, says Chief
Minister Vijay Rupani, when asked how big a role caste will play in next
month's assembly elections in the state. ""People will rise above caste and
will vote for nationalism and

_vikas _

(development),"" the Chief Minister said.

Rival Congress has reached out to young leaders like

Hardik Patel

, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakore in its attempt to draw Patel, Dalit and
backward caste (OBC) votes and the ruling BJP is doing its own arithmetic to
counter those plans, expected to reflect in its list of candidates, likely to
be announced next week.

""For us,

_Rashtravaad_

is the biggest factor just like it was in Uttar Pradesh...nationalism in any
form that is good for the country,"" Vijay Rupani told NDTV in an exclusive
interview just before the BJP's parliamentary party board met to decide on
candidates. The BJP, which swept UP, winning more than 300 out of 400 assembly
seats hopes to replicate that success in Gujarat, the home state of both Prime
Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah.

Vijay Rupani and team have been tasked by Amit Shah to win 150 of Gujarat's
182 seats. The chief minister, the Gujarat BJP's backroom boy turned key
stakeholder has already had multiple run ins with

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi

, who has launched an aggressive campaign in the state in an attempt to
deprive the BJP of another win. Mr Gandhi has hit out at the BJP over jobs and
has declared the ""Gujarat model of development"" failed, also urging traders to
reject the BJP over new national tax GST, which he has labelled the ""Gabbar
Singh Tax,"" after the iconic villain from Bollywood film Sholay.

Gujarat Assembly Elections 2017: Rahul Gandhi has launched an aggressive
campaign in the state ahead of the elections.

Mr Rupani dismissed reports that Rahul Gandhi has made inroads into Gujarat's
big voter base of traders and businessmen with his attack on GST. ""People mock
him on social media, can't you see,"" he said, although he admitted that the
major changes last week in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates, with many items
being brought down to lower tax brackets, is a major relief. ""We thank the
central government for listening to the people,' the Chief Minister said.

Rahul Gandhi, he alleged, ""talks baseless things,"" adding that he thus has a
new nickname for the Congress leader. ""I call him Gappidas,"" he said.

Vijay Rupani also attacked Mr Gandhi for visiting many temples during his
election campaign in Gujarat, being called a ""soft Hindutva"" line in a state
that has picked the BJP for the last 22 years. The BJP has called it an
election gimmick, devoid of devotion and with an eye only on Hindu votes.

""I think it is good that Rahul Gandhi is going to many temples. May the Lord
bless him with good sense. He went to Akshardham temple after Prime Minister
went there. I want to ask him, the Akshardham temple in Delhi, where people
from all over the world flock, is just a few kilometres from his home. Why
hasn't he ever gone there?"" the Gujarat chief minister said.

Rahul Gandhi's ""temple politics,"" he said, wouldn't wash with Gujarat's voters
because ""if he felt so much, when the Kerala unit of the Congress held a beef
festival and slaughtered a calf, why didn't he take action against any of
them?""

""Also, he went to JNU when people were shouting anti India slogans. People in
Gujarat see all of this.,"" said the chief minister, who began as an ABVP
activist, before a stint as the mayor of the city of Rajkot. he was also a
Rajya Sabha lawmaker before contesting a by-election in 2014 to become a
legislator, Gujarat BJP president and Chief Minister, all in just two years.

**Mission Indradhanush praised for immunising 2.55 crore children** 

 ______ 
As the mission completes three years next month, the overall report card reads well, though the ministry is yet to quantify the actual change in vaccination coverage.

Mobile vaccination vans, an officers’ WhatsApp group for daily monitoring and getting a local imam to be the voice of vaccination — Mission Indradhanush that recently earned rich praise in a Johns Hopkins report on global diarrhoea and pneumonia used all these and more to reach out to children left out of the routine immunisation exercise.

The numbers it notched up were impressive enough for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revise the 90 per cent coverage target deadline from 2020 to 2018 in a progress review meeting in May.

Four phases of Mission Indradhanush have been completed in which 2.55 crore children and 68.7 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated across the country. Compare this with an annual birth cohort of 2.63 crore children and routine immunisation that covers less than 2 crore every year.

The mission was led by former health secretary C K Mishra, who has now moved to the environment ministry.

As the mission completes three years next month, the overall report card reads well, though the ministry is yet to quantify the actual change in vaccination coverage.

On October 27, a meeting was held for a Coverage Evaluation Survey 2018 to be conducted by UNICEF so that the achievements can be authentically estimated.

The only pan-India vaccination figure that the government currently has is from the National Family Health Survey IV that is based on 2015-16 estimations and puts the vaccination coverage at 62 per cent.

As per the report of the Integrated Childhood and Immunisation Survey (INCHIS) the first two phases of Mission Indradhanush led to an increase in full immunisation coverage by 6.7 per cent in one year as compared to 1 per cent annual increase in the past.

In a bid to make the gains lasting, the ministry recently launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush — launched by Modi on October 8 from Vadnagar in Gujarat — under which the Centre is also providing resources to a state to ensure that the numbers do not slip back to starting levels.

“In MI (Mission Indradhanush), we were clear that states had to use existing resources but in IMI for which 121 districts have been identified, we are giving extra resources too. We have deployed mobile vans to access remote areas, arranged for TA/DAs for movement of health workers from one centre to another so that no centre lies unused and we have asked district magistrates to head the district task force meeting to fix accountability. There is a WhatsApp group of mission directors and state immunisation officers for daily updates and feedback,” a senior health ministry official said.

“Mission Indradhanush was launched on December 25, 2014, to plug the immunisation gaps with a goal of achieving 90 per cent immunisation. Cent per cent coverage targets are usually not set unless it is for a disease specific programme like polio because reaching the last 10% is usually a far more cost intensive exercise…,” the health official said.

A recent report on the progress of 15 countries with the highest number of children dying of pneumonia and diarrhoea compiled by International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health lauded India for the most progress because of Mission Indradhanush that “has vaccinated about 25 million children in over 500 districts. Along with the introduction and scale-up of new and underutilized vaccines in the UIP, MI has helped drive the increases in immunization coverage captured in India’s 2017 GAPPD (Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea) Score.”

**Country can ask Jaitley to quit over note ban, GST 'failures': Yashwant Sinha** 

 ______ 
AHMEDABAD: Criticising Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over imposing a ""deeply flawed"" Goods and Service Tax ( GST ), BJP veteran Yashwant Sinha today said countrymen can rightly demand he quit for the hardships caused and also felt he is a ""burden"" on the people of Gujarat.Jaitley is a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat.Sinha, who has been criticising the Modi government's economic policies, during an interaction with reporters here, also alleged that the GST was rolled out without giving due consideration to each and every aspect. Indian economy received ""two shocks"" in the form of demonetisation and GST in quick succession, said Sinha, a former union finance minister.Sinha was invited to poll-bound Cujarat by the activists associated with 'Lokshahi Bachao Andolan' (Save Democracy Movement) to share his views about the current state of economy and impact of demonetisation and GST.""Our finance minister is not from Gujarat, as he was elected to Rajya Sabha from here. And, he is a burden on the people of Gujarat. If he was not elected from here, a Gujarati would have got the chance,"" Sinha said while responding to a question.Sinha said the finance minister believes in only one rule, ""that is 'chitt bhi meri patt bhi meri', means heads I win, tails you lose.""The minister takes credit for everything, even if something is not implemented properly. If proper attention was paid while fixing the GST rates, such ""anomalies and anarchy"" could have been avoided, Sinha said.""He cannot take credit for imposing on the country a deeply flawed tax system, and people of this country are well within their right to demand that he should lose his job,"" the veteran leader said.On Jaitley's earlier remark that Sinha is looking for a job at the age of 80, Sinha, who insisted that he is not part of any 'Margdarshak Mandal', said he is still fit unlike those ""who give their speech while sitting"", an apparent reference to Jaitley, who had sat down in between his budget speech due to health reasons.""People who give their speeches in sitting position are talking about my age,"" he said.Without taking any name, Sinha said attempts were made by some people to create a rift between him and his son- Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha.""Though some people had made attempts to create a rift between us, they did not get any success,"" Sinha said in a reference to the political storm that erupted after his article, criticising the Modi government over the state of economy, was published in a newspaper in September.In that article, Sinha, who was the finance minister under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, had criticised Jaitley over the ""mess the finance minister has made of the economy"" and said he would be failing in his national duty if he did not speak up.Responding to a question, Sinha lashed out at Jaitley over calling Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi 'childish' for demanding single tax rate under GST.""Go back in history and you will find that Jaitley himself had said that we will progress towards a single tax structure. That is what he had said.

**Congress raises questions over Rafale deal, BJP hits back** 

 ______ 
Raising questions over the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, the Congress today accused the government of having compromised national interest and security while promoting ""crony capitalism"" and causing a loss to the public exchequer.

The BJP rubbished the allegation, claiming it was intended to ""divert attention"" as the party bigwigs faced the prospect of being questioned in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scandal.

The Congress' communications department head Randeep Surjewala alleged the government neglected the interests of public sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as Dassault Aviation, the french manufacturer of Rafale aircraft refused to transfer technology to it and instead entered into an agreement with Reliance Defence.

He also alleged that the aircraft was being purchased at much higher rates than what was decided after the completion of the tender process under the previous UPA government.

The BJP hit right back, with its spokesman GVL Narasimha Rao claiming that the Congress party was engaging in a ""stunt"" by raising the Rafale issue as it was scared at the prospect of its top leadership, including the Gandhis, being questioned in the VVIP chopper scam.

He said after the arrest of middleman Carlos Gerosa in Italy last month and his likely extradition to India soon, ""the Congress has made baseless allegations over Rafale deal to divert public attention and to cry political vendetta"".

""None of these stunts will work and the Congress must be ready to answer who took bribes in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal as the money trail is going to become known after the extradition of Carlos Gerosa,"" he told .

""Modi government is known for integrity and all its actions are above board, while the Congress party is synonymous with sleaze, corruption and crony capitalism,"" he said.

Surjewala said the UPA government floated a tender on August 20, 2007 for purchase of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) for the Air Force and, post negotiations, two of them--Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon remained in the reckoning.

On December 12, 2012, Rafale was declared L1 vendor, the bidder whose quotation is the lowest, with base price of USD 10.20 billion (Rs 54,000 crore according to the conversion rate prevalent then).

It was decided that of the 126 aircraft, 18 would come in fly away condition and the remaining 108 will be manufactured in India by HAL with transfer of techonology, he said.

After the Modi government was formed in May 2014, Surjewala said, the earlier Request for Proposal (RFP) for purchase of 126 aircraft was cancelled on July 30, 2015, and signed a deal on September 26 the next year for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets for USD 8.7 billion.

Later, he said, Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence Limited tied up with Dassault Aviation for a joint venture for defence production in India on October 3, 2016.

""There is complete non-transparency, flagrant violation of mandatory provision of Defence Procurement Procedure, sacrificing national interest on transfer of technology to PSU HAL and blatant promotion of financial interests of crony capitalist friends of the prime minister have marred the purchase of the aircraft,"" Surjewala alleged.

The Congress leader claimed that each aircraft would have cost Rs 526.10 crore in accordance with the negotiations under the UPA dispensation. Each aircraft would now cost Rs 1570.80 crore, he said, adding ""huge"" loss was being caused to the exchequer.

Surjewala also alleged that the deal between Dassault Aviation and Reliance Defence Limited did not have the approval of the Union Cabinet, Cabinet Committee on Security and Foreign Investment Promotion Board.

""It is time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government to answer to people of India as to why government is buying 36 Rafale aircraft at a highly inflated price compared to originally negotiated base price by UPA-Congress,"" he said.

Instead of coming with stupid *jumlas* like odd-even day car rides, AAP government should have been working on actual, practical solutions - they've had more than a year now.

NCT too has a lot of farmers who burn their crops. What solution has the AAP come with the it too deal with them? Instead, they just blame the farmers of neighbouring states to divert the public's attention. 

If you've identified a problem, you need to find why the problem came to or exists in the first place. 

CM Amarinder has rightly pointed out that burning waste and stubbles is the cheapest way the farmers know to dispose it. Now if you want to reduce it, you obviously will have to talk with them and come to an understanding with them. He is their CM too, and Punjab's economy depends highly on its farmers. So he would be a fool to ignore their concerns.

This is why the rest of India doesn't respect Kejriwal - they understand that he is an educated Modi who just likes attention and practices similar politics of *jumlas* when he fails to deliver. ",2017-11-15 09:18:24

**Have you forgotten 1993 Mumbai blasts: Dawood aide threatens India Today** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Our reporter got threat call from Karachi, 24 hours after Dawood tapes were aired.

2 The caller warned of a bigger attack than the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai.

3 The auctioning of his Mumbai properties has left Dawood particularly upset.

After India Today aired a conversation between underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and one of his aides in connection with providing security to Nadeem Saifi, accused in singer Gulshan Kumar murder case, the channel's reporters have received threat calls from the D-company. The D-company also warned that it would not allow anyone to build on Dawood's 3 properties, which were auctioned in Mumbai today.

India Today reporter Virendrasingh Ghunawat got a threat call from a Karachi-based number within 24 hours after Dawood audio tapes were aired.

""Have you forgotten 1993 blasts?"" asked the caller, who identified himself as Usman Chaudhary and a member of Dawood's gang.

The caller warned of a bigger attack than the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai. He added that Dawood was particularly miffed after his properties in Mumbai were auctioned to Saifi Burhani Trust and that the don would not allow anyone to construct on the auctioned land.

'DARE NOT CONSTRUCT ON BHAI's LAND'

""We dare anyone to construct on bhai's land,"" he said.

The caller added that Dawood was not scared of the Modi government and warned of a major attack in the days to come.

India Today has handed over the threatening audio recording to Mumbai Police, which is now investigating the same.

""We have informed the Mumbai Police regarding the call and have alerted them. Mumbai Commissioner of Police and Joint CP (crime) have been informed about it"", India Today crew said.

India Today had on Monday aired telephonic conversations of Dawood Ibrahim with members of his terrorist network. Nadeem Saifi spoke to India Today after the tapes were aired on television. Saifi says he has never heard Dawood's voice before and he never got any security cover from the D-Company as referred to in the audio tapes. The former Bollywood music director said he lives in Dubai running a perfume business which apparently is not faring well these days. Here's what Nadeem told India Today .

**Indian Twitter users roast New York Times for sari state of affairs** 

 ______ 
An article published in The New York Times titled ""In India, fashion has become a nationalist cause"", has not gone down very well with Indian Twitter users. The piece published a couple of days ago is now going viral on social media platforms for all the wrong reasons.

In the article, the author / reporter argues that since Narendra Modi became the prime minister of India in 2014, the Indian fashion industry and the major players have made a conscious decision to ""Indianise"" fashion to please the prime minister, his party and his ""Hindu nationalist"" ideology.

Beginning the piece saying that the ""the rise of Hindu nationalist politics has become a major obstacle to realising the country's promise of growth,"" the author, Asgar Qadri, says that the Indian fashion industry was pressured to ""aggressively promote traditional attire and bypass Western styles"" by the Bharata Janata Party that rose to power in 2014.

Qadri goes on to say that PM Modi, during his election campaign in Varanasi, promised to revive the tradition of the Banarasi sari and in turn help the weavers, mostly Muslim, and that a visit to Modi's constituency made him realise that nothing has changed for the weavers, that they still live in poverty. He says that Modi's call to revive the Banarasi sari benefited the merchants in the city, though.

POOR ARGUMENTS LEFT INDIAN TWITTER FURIOUS

Indian Twitterati minced no words while slamming The New York Times article that inferred that sari has become a trend post Modi's and BJP's rise to power. While some slammed the author and the publication for suggesting that ""sari is a Hindu attire"", and for being clueless, some went on to say that this article is an attempt to 'communalise' Indian attire and said that the author is a Muslim.

Here are some reactions to the article -

**GST aftershock creates widening two-speed economy in India**

Mumbai: India’s biggest tax overhaul since independence has driven a wedge between companies that have adapted to the new levies and a vast swathe of small businesses, representing almost half the economy, that are struggling.

The trend emerging from the first quarter of earnings since the goods and services tax, or GST, was introduced on 1 July shows bigger companies such as the Tata Group’s Titan Co. Ltd, India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd have used the disruptions to gain market share. Smaller operations are reporting that increased compliance costs, supply-chain disruptions and policy changes have hurt profits and forced some to shed workers.

Last week the government cut the tax payable on about 200 items and eased filing norms after it was criticized by some for a chaotic roll-out as companies grappled with the multi-tier structure and onerous reporting system.

The disruptions have hit traders, traditionally a large vote base for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party. Addressing any slump in activity among the country’s 58 million small enterprises, and the businesses they supply, will be crucial for growth to rebound in Asia’s third-largest economy.

Modi’s challenge

It will take time for small and medium-sized enterprises to recover from the “GST blues” as many weren’t prepared and couldn’t deal with the changes, said M.S. Mani, a partner overseeing GST at Deloitte India. “This led to some of them putting all operations on hold and it will now take some time for them to revive their business. Many smaller companies are suppliers to large businesses and they were worried about business continuance and tax challenges.”

India’s GST has been more than a decade in the making and is expected to make dodging taxes more difficult, bringing the nation’s vast cash economy into the mainstream. But its disruptive roll out and concerns about a widening gap between better-run companies and the laggards—often smaller firms and those in the informal sector—poses a challenge to Modi who rode to power in 2014 on the promise of more inclusive growth.

The difference for Mithun Chittilappilly, managing director at V-Guard Industries Ltd, which deals with both large and small companies, is down to how cash intensive a business was as well as how prepared they were to make the necessary accounting and technology changes. The consumer durable goods sector, which is more formalized, has better transitioned than others including electrical goods players, said Chittilappilly, whose company manufactures stabilizers, pumps, cables, electrical and solar water heaters.

“In the case of the electrical trade, in many other parts of the country we saw that they were not doing really anything. There is a lot of unorganized sales happening,” he said, adding that many companies didn’t even have technology systems in place on 1 July.

Technology hiccups

Citigroup Inc. analysts Jamshed Dadabhoy, Aditya Mathur and Arvind Sharma travelled through the state of Madhya Pradesh in October to meet local companies, wholesalers and traders. In most conversations, owners indicated increased compliance costs and difficulties with the technology and network to upload tax invoices.

On the other hand, Nisaba Godrej, executive chairwoman of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, said remaining “agile” helped her 120-year-old soap company navigate channel disruptions and deliver 10% volume growth.

The gold and jewellery industry is another example of how organized retail has side-stepped any overall volume declines. Titan—which gets 80% of its revenue from jewellery—reported a 71% rise in second-quarter net profit from a year earlier and a 29% increase in sales.

At the same time, gold consumption in India dropped to a seven-year low in 2016 as efforts to formalize purchases damped demand. Volumes will probably remain near last year’s level in 2017 as well, estimates the World Gold Council.

“There are a few companies that are doing well from a market share capture perspective, like Titan Co. Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Hero Motocorp India and organized retailers, but we didn’t get the impression of an acceleration in demand yet,” the Citigroup analysts wrote in a report.

That view was shared by the chief of one of India’s largest electrical equipment manufacturer, Havells India’s Anil Rai Gupta. Businesses have been slow to replenish inventories that were emptied out before GST due to the uncertainty stemming from the new levies, he said.

Billionaire Uday Kotak, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd expects companies in the informal sector to lose out unless they change the way they do business. “That is pretty straight forward. Players in the informal sector will realize that the old ways are dead. So either change or perish,” he said in an interview.

Small traders

Credit Suisse analysts, Neelkanth Mishra and Prateek Singh cited surveys by Tally Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a software provider, to highlight the pain of many small enterprises.

The surveys indicate businesses are holding back payments to their suppliers till they are convinced the supplier has paid the tax and uploaded the invoice. “This is because they are unsure they will get any credit,” they wrote in a report. “If this is systemic and not just a few anecdotes, it could slow down activity levels in many supply chains for several months.” Bloomberg

**Why India needs to give Indians the tools to succeed** 

 ______ 
With its growing population, India has plenty of workers. Yet investors commonly complain that they can’t find employees with suitable skills and abilities. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

If India is to live up the expectations of its own people and become a successful middle-income country in a few decades, the country has multiple problems to solve—its sclerotic politics, its clogged infrastructure, its choked judicial system, its lack of investable capital, its interfering and inefficient state. But perhaps the greatest hurdle is its poor stock of human capital. Without better education, health and skills, India won’t be able to build a middle class and its efforts to become the next China can’t succeed.

India is already failing its young people. Tens of millions of them are unemployed and under-employed, and the situation isn’t improving. Quite the opposite: According to one well-regarded employment survey, from the Delhi-based Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, almost 1.5 million people lost their jobs during the first four months of 2017, while another 420,000 jobs vanished in the next four months. India’s relatively small manufacturing sector has suffered especially badly; one industry body, the All India Manufacturers’ Association, has claimed that the rate of job losses is much higher. (The government itself publishes no reliable data on the subject but has promised to do so—though I suspect we won’t see any until the next general elections, scheduled for 2019, are done.)

Things are particularly bad in the informal sector and for lower-skilled workers. The government’s decision a year ago to withdraw 86% of currency in circulation hit the informal sector hard, while the red tape imposed by a confusing new goods and services tax (GST) made the problem worse. One senior government minister highlighted the issue, if a little callously, when he argued that “only those not skilled enough have lost jobs.” Unfortunately, far too many Indians aren’t skilled enough.

India and its government are caught between two development models. On the one hand, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept to power in 2014, he promised to revive India’s struggling manufacturing sector and even launched a high-profile “Make in India” campaign. Some of these efforts have now borne fruit, with India moving up 30 places in the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings, for example. But conditions haven’t improved enough to encourage serious investment in manufacturing. And without that money, Modi’s vision of creating belts of export-oriented factories along India’s coastline is still just a vision.

The government is now promoting another optimistic scenario: one in which India’s digital backbone enables new businesses and provides employment to millions of small-scale entrepreneurs. This has the advantage of not requiring any large-scale administrative or regulatory reforms. Others, who question the future of manufacturing as automation erodes the traditional advantages of lower-wage countries, have also embraced this possibility.

Yet there remains one giant problem: Indians’ skills don’t match up. Consider the “Make in India” program. With its growing population, India has plenty of workers. Yet investors commonly complain that they can’t find employees with suitable skills and abilities. Various efforts by the government to create skilling programs have fallen far short of targets—so far short, in fact, that it’s recently abandoned targets altogether.

Nor is the alternative vision, whereby technology transforms India’s landscape of small enterprises and the country leapfrogs into middle-income status, likely given the country’s current human-capital profile. One big reason India’s transition to the new GST has been so traumatic is that it requires too many taxpayers to be familiar with online payments, with accounting software and so on. This may have sounded like a reasonable assumption to officials sitting in New Delhi and pondering India’s digital future. It’s clearly far from the reality.

Today, the folly of this expectation has been painfully revealed. Entrepreneurs and small companies aren’t confident enough to file their taxes themselves and are having to hire people with those skills. In many cases, the additional cost has pushed low-margin companies out of business. Building a small-scale, dynamic, digital economy shifts much of the burden of adaptation, compliance and planning onto ordinary Indians. Many simply aren’t prepared to take on those tasks.

India has long understood that it needs to reform its state and build its infrastructure if it is to grow. To those imperatives must be added a third: It needs to invest in Indians. Less than 4% of GDP is spent on education. Appallingly, Indian students spend more in the US than their government spends on higher education in total. Growth economists have long understood that human capital is what drives economies. India’s policymakers need to accept that fact, too. Bloomberg View

**Chandigarh Lit Fest: ‘Modi Yug’ bitter for writers, says Hindi poet Manglesh Dabral** 

 ______ 
Born into the ‘Nehru Yug’, writing in the ‘Indira Yug’ and dwelling in the ‘Modi Yug’: this is how prominent Hindi poet Manglesh Dabral described his journey as a poet. He was at Chandigarh Literature Festival to talk about his new collection of poems, ‘Naye Yug Mein Shatru’, on the second day of the festival at Panjab University.

Another prominent Hindi poet and critic, Asad Zaidi, joined him for the discussion. The meaning of the word, ‘shatru’ (enemy), turned quite literal. Zaidi said the title of the book talked volumes of Dabral’s conscious and expresses the fear caused in the society by this ‘shatru’.

“The first and the last refuge for us is poetry and language. We have the job to save the imagination. I have never seen the situation so worse as it is now in the Modi Yug.”

Zaidi talked about how Dabral’s poetry gave space to the new and the past, its hope in resistance and the historical responsibility of contemporary poetry.

He added that the ‘Modi Yug’ was too bitter for writers.

He further said, “Resistance was not a duty when we started writing, but with time it became one.” He added that Dabral returned his Sahitya Akademi award to fulfil that role.

Dabral said, “The first and the last refuge for us is poetry and language. We have the job to save the imagination. I have never seen the situation so worse as it is now in the Modi Yug.” “Anything can happen instantly. There’s fear in people’s minds. Terror has been democratised and citizens are not realising it,” he added.

He lamented that Hindi will become the language of just market, advertisement and merchandise soon, adding, “It’s not going to help the language if Obama says namaste.”

He further said the worst part was that the media had stopped reading literature and that has created a “poverty of the mind”. Dabral recited several of his poems, including ‘Torch, Gujarat Ke Mritak Ka Bayaan’. He concluded, “The new generation will have to dream for another ‘yug’ and then realise it.”

**Demonetisation has caused a loss of Rs 3.75 lakh crore, economy standing on one leg: Yashwant Sinha**

Claiming that demonetisation and its after-effects might have cost a Rs 3.75 lakh crore loss to the nation, former finance minister and veteran BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Tuesday likened the termination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes to the one implemented 700 years ago by Muhammad-Bin-Tuqhlaq, the Sultan from Tuqhlaq dynasty who ruled Delhi from 1325-1351 AD.

“In history, a number of emperors, monarchs and kings have conducted demonetisation… About 700 years ago, there was an emperor in this country, who introduced his currency and ended the circulation of the older one. Demonetisation happened 700 years ago. The emperor’s name was Muhammed-Bin-Tuqhlaq. He is infamous in history for shifting the capital of his empire from Delhi to Daulatabad,” Sinha said referring to Tuqhlaq’s move to replace gold and silver coins with token currencies made of copper and bronze.

Speaking at an event organised by “Lokshahi Bachao Abhiyan”, where former Gujarat chief minister Suresh Mehta was also present, Sinha said, “Demonetisation was considered so important that the PM decided that he himself will announce it, instead of allowing the RBI Governor or the Finance Minister to do it. While announcing it through an hour-long speech, he mentioned black money 74 or 75 times. Fake currency and terrorism were also mentioned, but no where was digital and cashless economy mentioned.”

The veteran BJP leader said when Modi felt the targets of demonetisation were not being achieved, he started talking about cashless economy. “Nobody had cash then. The country had already turned cashless,” said Sinha as the audience, largely consisting of senior citizens in Thakorbhai Desai, Hall applauded.

Sinha said Modi himself had said 18 lakh deposits were being probed after demonetisation. “A message is going across the world that India is a nation of thieves; we all are involved in illegal activities; there is nobody honest here,” said Sinha, while claiming that the entire process of demonetisation and the dip in economic activity together had caused a loss of Rs 3.75 lakh crore to the nation.

“These days, a there is a new tradition. Everything is a media event. Nobody has done anything before us is a remark that has become common. Atal Bihari Vajyapee ruled the nation for six years. If you say, nothing has been done for the last 70 years, then has Vajpayee ji done anything that was worth taking note of? If that is so, then why was Bharat Ratna given to AB Vaypayee,” Sinha said, adding that the stand taken that “only I am right, and nobody else is” cannot work.

He also narrated how Vajpayee emphasised on reaching a “consensus” with the opposition parties about United States when the Iraq war broke out. “I learnt a very important lesson from Vajpayeeji. Consensus should be created… Opposition (parties) is not an enemy,” he remarked.

Sinha said that the deadlines of every promise that the government made before ascending power in May 2014 had been extended to 2022. “We have to tell the people of this country what all we did in 2019,” he quipped.

Economy standing on one leg

Talking about the state of the economy, the former finance minister said, “Today the finance minister claims that our economic fundamentals are strong… Our fiscal deficit is under control at around 3 per cent, our current account deficit is around 1.25 per cent, inflation is under control, stock markets are booming and there is an atmosphere of happiness and peace all around. Now, we also have a certificate from US President (Donald) Trump.” Sinha said all this was due to the low prices of international crude, which fell from $110 per barrel in May 2014 to $29 in the subsequent months after the NDA government took charge in New Delhi.

“This (the fall of crude prices) did not happen because of us. It was not that the lion of Gujarat roared and all the oil exporting countries got scared and decided to lower the prices,” Sinha remarked. He said the government had failed to take advantage of the fallen crude prices and did little to boost domestic economy.

“What we are seeing today is the silence before the storm. Now the prices of crude has increased to $60 per barrel, the stock markets have turned volatile, the rupee has weakened against the US dollar and the feeling of comfort that existed, now seems to be ending…I do not want to be a prophet of doom,” Sinha said, adding that the rise in crude prices could destablise the economy.

“Today our economy is standing on a single leg,” Sinha said. He said the economy’s lone support was low prices of international crude and nobody could predict how much longer the prices would remain subdued. “Domestic demand and domestic savings will be the guiding principles of Indian economy, not foreign demand and investment,” he added.

**1. Have Smt. Sonia Gandhi or Shri Rahul Gandhi benefited financially from Young Indian?**

No. As directors or shareholders of Young Indian, a non-profit, Section 25 company, they are prohibited by law from drawing (and have not drawn) any financial benefits from the company.

**2. Have any assets been transferred from The Associated Journals Ltd. (AJL) to Young Indian (YI)?**

No. All the assets and the income of AJL remain with the company. Not a single paisa has gone to YI, YI Directors or YI Shareholders.

**3. Does YI today own the property owned by AJL?**

No, both YI and AJL are separate entities. All assets and properties of AJL continue to remain with AJL. This allegation is akin to falsely alleging that a shareholder in Indian Hotels Ltd. has rights on hotel properties of the Taj Group and owns a particular hotel or can move into it!

**4. Young Indian was created to usurp the property owned by The Associated Journals Ltd.?**

False. On the contrary, Young Indian, being a non-profit Section 25 company, as the major shareholder AJL, in fact, enhances the safeguards on the properties of the AJL.

**5. Why did the Congress Party give loans of Rs 90 crore to AJL?**

The Congress Party financially supported AJL over several decades through the financial ill health of the company. This reflected the Party’s commitment to support AJL, the voice of the freedom movement. The founding document of AJL from 1937, i.e. the company’s Memorandum of Association, states in Object (t): ""The policy of any newspaper, periodical, magazine or journal issued by the Company shall generally be in accordance with the policy and principles of the Indian National Congress."" This demonstrates the inextricable link between AJL and the Congress Party from AJL’s inception. The Congress Party sought to fulfill its own objects by supporting AJL.

**6. Arun Jaitley called Young Indian a real estate company. Is this true?**

Absolutely false. YI does not own a single real estate asset or immoveable property. AJL continues to own all its assets. The allegation is, therefore, completely baseless.

**7. Why did AJL not go to a bank in 2010 to repay its Rs. 90 crore debt?**

There was a Rs. 90 crore loan from the Congress Party on AJL’s balance sheet. No commercial bank was willing to lend a single rupee to AJL due to the negative worth of the company, its meager income and its over-levered balance sheet.

**8. Are political parties allowed to give loans?**

Yes. There is no restriction in law on political parties giving loans. In fact, the Election Commission of India issued a clear order in this regard in November 2012. Shri Subramanian Swamy had sought the de-recognition of the Congress on this ground but his complaint was dismissed by a full bench order of the Election Commission.

**9. How bad was AJL's financial position?**

Details of profit and loss (in Rs. Lacs) are below. Please note that after AJL’s debt of Rs. 90 crores was extinguished in February 2011, AJL was able to declare its first profit in several years in 2011-12 and came into the black from the red. This was only as a result of the financial revival plan of AJL as conceived by the Congress Party.

[AJL Profit / Losss](https://imgur.com/a/XpXIA).

**10. What did AJL do with the financial support given by the Congress Party?**

The money was used to pay unpaid salaries, VRS, taxes, dues to civic agencies and statutory and other liabilities/payables.

**11. Why were the assets of AJL not liquidated?**

The majority of AJL’s properties were government leases, which prohibited sale of land.

**12. Were the shareholders of AJL cheated, as some have alleged?**

All the shareholders present and voting at the Extraordinary General meeting in 2011 unanimously approved issuance of fresh equity to YI to extinguish debt of AJL. The question of cheating shareholders does not arise.

**13. Will the National Herald be revived?**

AJL has every intention of reviving the National Herald newspaper and restoring the media voice that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had founded.

**14. Why should a political party have anything to do with a newspaper?**

Every political party needs to effectively communicate its ideology and its policies to the public at large. A newspaper provides a channel through which to do this.

**BJP is clearly ahead of the Congress in Gujarat in terms of performance and perception** 

 ______ 
Indian elections are a psephologist’s nightmare. With the deep penetration of digital media and social media, the access to information that an average voter has is much more today than in the past. That has led to greater maturity in the electorate.

There used to be a time when pundits would assume that politics is a group activity. It was easier to analyse voter behaviour then. All that the person had to do was to try and analyse the behaviour of the group and predict the outcome. This is no longer the case. Elections are no longer are a group activity. The old school electoral analysis that a particular caste or group would vote in a predictable manner no longer holds water.

The voter today is an enlightened citizen. Voting happens on the people’s assessment of the leader, his policies and, most importantly, his connect and traction with the masses. In other words the voters today look for performance or the ability to deliver.

When performance becomes the benchmark, perception becomes the battleground. Performance doesn’t lie in the figures that one doles out or the publicity material that is put out. It boils down to how people perceive your performance.

The ongoing assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat need to be seen from this perspective. The BJP hopes to perform well in both states. It enjoys a distinct advantage over its main rival – the Congress – on both counts viz. performance and perception. Prime Minister Modi continues to be massively popular across the country. He is one leader who has defied the conventional political logic of incumbency. After almost three-and-a-half years, his popularity doesn’t seem to have dipped at all. He has acquired a cult status among the masses, which will certainly help BJP at the hustings.

In terms of its performance, while the Congress government in Himachal was seen as a corrupt and inefficient one, the BJP government in Gujarat has many things to its credit in terms of good governance and delivery. Over 40 months of excellent performance by the central government in various sectors too will favour of the BJP.

The two parties are locked in a perception battle. Yet the immaturity of the Congress leadership, that comes out pronouncedly on many occasions, leaves it way behind in this battle too. Take the example of GST. It was a tax regime that had been brokered by the central government through absolute consensus. It is in fact a classic example of cooperative federalism in action. The Congress’ sustained attack on the government on GST is no doubt aimed at winning a perception advantage. Yet one fails to understand Rahul Gandhi’s one tax slab solution of 18% GST on all goods.

Perceptions are created through the media – mainstream and social. The BJP is way ahead of Congress in this regard. While the mainstream media remains fiercely independent, it is on social media that battlelines are drawn in politics. Although infused with a new team and technique, the Congress is no match for BJP’s well-oiled machine.

The Congress is certainly failing on two fronts. Its efforts to ridicule development through slogans like ‘vikas pagal ho gaya’ will boomerang on it in states like Gujarat where the fruits of the state’s development are being enjoyed by a large section of the people. Rahul Gandhi himself, after criticising the BJP for lack of development in Gujarat, had to praise the skill and industrial progress in Surat and elsewhere. Second, their reliance on smaller caste group leaders in the hope that they will provide bulk votes betrays the Congress’ inability to understand the changed face of India’s polity.

The BJP has not yet launched its carpet-bombing exercise through the extensive visits of the prime minister himself and dozens of our star campaigners. Once that begins, the Congress will be no match as it clearly lacks charismatic and inspiring leadership at both the national and state levels.

We take every election – small or big – seriously. We are doing the same in Gujarat as well. The only sense of satisfaction that the Congress may perhaps draw is in the fact that it has succeeded, largely with the help of the mainstream media, in creating an impression that a battle royal is on in Gujarat; whereas it is far from reality. In military parlance it is said that the generals shouldn’t be in trenches. The Congress can draw some satisfaction from the fact that it has been able to send some of the BJP’s generals into the trenches.

Otherwise the results of this round of assembly polls are clear.

Have you forgotten 1993 Mumbai blasts: Dawood aide threatens India Today

A caller from Karachi identified himself as D-Company's Usman Chaudhury. He said that Dawood Ibrahim was particularly miffed after his properties were auctioned off today.

By IndiaToday.in |

After India Today aired a conversation between underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and one of his aides in connection with providing security to Nadeem Saifi, accused in singer Gulshan Kumar murder case, the channel's reporters have received threat calls from the D-company. The D-company also warned that it would not allow anyone to build on Dawood's 3 properties, which were auctioned in Mumbai today.

India Today reporter Virendrasingh Ghunawat got a threat call from a Karachi-based number within 24 hours after Dawood audio tapes were aired.

""Have you forgotten 1993 blasts?"" asked the caller, who identified himself as Usman Chaudhary and a member of Dawood's gang.

The caller warned of a bigger attack than the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai. He added that Dawood was particularly miffed after his properties in Mumbai were auctioned to Saifi Burhani Trust and that the don would not allow anyone to construct on the auctioned land.

'DARE NOT CONSTRUCT ON BHAI's LAND'

""We dare anyone to construct on bhai's land,"" he said.

The caller added that Dawood was not scared of the Modi government and warned of a major attack in the days to come.

India Today has handed over the threatening audio recording to Mumbai Police, which is now investigating the same.

""We have informed the Mumbai Police regarding the call and have alerted them. Mumbai Commissioner of Police and Joint CP (crime) have been informed about it"", India Today crew said.

India Today had on Monday aired telephonic conversations of Dawood Ibrahim with members of his terrorist network. Nadeem Saifi spoke to India Today after the tapes were aired on television. Saifi says he has never heard Dawood's voice before and he never got any security cover from the D-Company as referred to in the audio tapes. The former Bollywood music director said he lives in Dubai running a perfume business which apparently is not faring well these days. Here's what Nadeem told India Today .

**France Rejects Congress Rafale Charge, Reliance Defence Threatens to Sue** 

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

France has categorically rejected allegations made by the Congress party that
the Narendra Modi government has negotiated an overpriced deal with French
company Dassault to supply the Indian Air Force with 36 state-of-the-art
Rafale fighter jets, while the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence Limited has
threatened to sue the opposition party if it does not retract its charge that
it was unfairly picked to be the French firm's Indian partner.

""This fighter jet has been selected for its outstanding performance and
competitive price. It was selected through a fully transparent and competitive
process,"" French diplomatic sources said, today describing the Congress
allegations as ""a domestic political matter"" that they would not like to
enter.

The Congress has alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has
caused an ""insurmountable loss"" of taxpayers' money in signing the deal for 36
Rafale aircraft from France for Rs 58,000 crores (7.8 billion Euros). The
opposition party alleged on Tuesday that the cost of each aircraft is three
times more than what the previous UPA government it led had negotiated with
France in 2012.

The Congress has also asked why the government ""promoted the interests of one
industrial group, i.e Reliance Defence Limited, which has led to the company
tying up and entering into a joint venture with Dassault Aviation worth Rs.
30,000 crores?""

Responding to the allegations, Reliance Defence said, ""Government policy
issued on 24 June 2016 allows for 49% FDI in the Defence Sector under the
automatic route, without any prior approval. No approvals from the Union
Cabinet or CCS were required for the formation of the aforesaid Joint Venture
company under the automatic route."" The company said its reserves the right to
take legal action against the Congress if the allegations against it are not
withdrawn.

Several of the allegations raised by the Congress to question the deal are not
new. For more than a year, critics have suggested that India has got a raw
deal on the Rafale jets, which will form the cutting edge of the Indian Air
Force's fighter fleet once the aircraft start getting inducted.

While it is true that the unit price of each aircraft is more than what had
earlier been negotiated, several aspects of the deal that have sent the cost
up have not been stated by the Congress in its latest allegations.

For one, while the Rafale had emerged as the lowest bidder (Rs. 54,000 crores)
in an international tender in 2012, the final deal could never be closed by
the UPA government. By the time the BJP-led government came to power in 2014,
the deal was completely deadlocked with Dassault refusing to certify key
components of the jet which were to be built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
unless a series of conditions were met.

With no deal around the corner and with successive Air Chiefs telling the
government that India's air defence would be seriously affected without the
jets being inducted, PM Modi had announced an off-the-shelf purchase from
France during a visit to Paris in April 2015. ""France has always been a
reliable supplier for India from jet fighters to submarines,"" the Prime
Minister said.

Also, the cost of the overall deal would have gone up since it was calculated
that manpower required to assemble each jet was nearly three times higher in
India than it was in France.

When the deal for the Rafales was finally signed, they came at 2016 prices,
significantly higher than what was on offer four years earlier. Apart from the
aircraft, the price also includes several key items, including state of the
art weaponry, spares support for seven years and India-specific customisation
of the jet that the French Air Force and Navy operate.

Under this deal, the Indian Air Force Rafales will come equipped with the
Meteor, the world's most advanced Beyond Visual Range Air to Air Missile which
can hit targets further out than any comparable missile at the moment. India
is acquiring the SCALP cruise missile which can hit ground targets more than
500 km away and will be customised to eventually deploy a variant of India's
BrahMos anti-ship cruise missile.

Software codes and patches will be provided so that future integration of new
weapons systems take place in India. An Israeli helmet mounted display will be
integrated into the jet.

Significantly for the Indian Air Force, which has faced enormous problems with
the reliability of its Sukhoi-30 fighters, the French will guarantee the
performance of the Rafale and provide complete logistics support to ensure
that 75 per cent of the Rafale fleet will be battle-worthy when required. The
IAF has struggled to get over 50 per cent mission availability for its Sukhoi
fighters.

Nine Indian Air Force personnel including three pilots will be trained in
France with the IAF also getting access to French Air Force Rafales for
training.

In order to reduce costs, the government capped the European inflation indices
to 3.5 per cent which means that if inflation goes down, so will the cost of
the overall deal, the payout for which happens in tranches.

The first Rafale jets are to enter service with the Indian Air Force from 2019
onwards and Dassault has been negotiating with the government of India for a
deal of 36 more jets which would form two more squadrons.

**Narendra Modi remains 'by far' most popular figure in Indian politics: Pew survey** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains ""by far"" the most popular figure in Indian politics, the Pew said today, releasing the main findings of its latest survey conducted among 2,464 respondents in India. Modi at 88 per cent is 30 points ahead of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (58 per cent), 31 points ahead of Congress president Sonia Gandhi (57 per cent) and 49 points ahead of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal (39 per cent), said the survey conducted between February 21 and March 10 this year.Pew said the public's ""positive assessment"" of Modi is buoyed by ""growing contentment"" with the Indian economy: more than eight-in-ten say economic conditions are ""good"", up 19 percentage points since immediately before the 2014 election.The share of adults who say the economy is ""very good"" (30 per cent) has tripled in the past three years, it added.Overall, seven-in-ten Indians are now ""satisfied"" with the way things are going in the country. This positive assessment of India's direction has nearly doubled since 2014, Pew said.According to Pew, at least nine-in-ten Indians in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana and in the western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh hold a favorable view of the prime minister.The same is true for more than eight-in-ten in the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal and the northern states of Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.""Since 2015, Modi's popularity is relatively unchanged in the north, has risen in the west and the south, and is down slightly in the east,"" it said.Notably, the survey reflects a 21 percentage points drop in favorable view of America among Indians from 70 per cent in 2015 to just 49 per cent in 2017.Only 40 per cent express confidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs, down 34 points from their faith in his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015.Same is the case with China, whose favorability rating among Indians have dropped from 41 per cent in 2015 to 26 per cent in 2017. The survey was conducted before the Doklam crisis.According to Pew Survey , despite periodic outbreaks of religious violence, relatively few Indians see communal relations as a very big problem.""Similarly, despite Prime Minister Modi's decision last November to abolish high-value bank notes, less than half of the Indian population sees the lack of availability of cash to be a major problem,"" it said.

**GST disruptions help Maruti, Tata Group and Godrej to gain market share as small firms struggle** 

 ______ 
Many smaller companies are suppliers to large businesses and they were worried about business continuance and tax challenges. (Reuters Photo)

India’s biggest tax overhaul since independence has driven a wedge between companies that have adapted to the new levies and a vast swath of small businesses, representing almost half the economy, that are struggling. The trend emerging from the first quarter of earnings since the goods and services tax, or GST, was introduced on July 1 shows bigger companies such as the Tata Group’s Titan Co. Ltd, India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. have used the disruptions to gain market share. Smaller operations are reporting that increased compliance costs, supply-chain disruptions and policy changes have hurt profits and forced some to shed workers. Last week the government cut the tax payable on about 200 items and eased filing norms after it was criticized by some for a chaotic roll-out as companies grappled with the multi-tier structure and onerous reporting system. The disruptions have hit traders, traditionally a large vote base for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party. Addressing any slump in activity among the country’s 58 million small enterprises, and the businesses they supply, will be crucial for growth to rebound in Asia’s third-largest economy.

Modi’s Challenge

It will take time for small and medium-sized enterprises to recover from the “GST blues” as many weren’t prepared and couldn’t deal with the changes, said M.S. Mani, a partner overseeing GST at Deloitte India. “This led to some of them putting all operations on hold and it will now take some time for them to revive their business. Many smaller companies are suppliers to large businesses and they were worried about business continuance and tax challenges.” India’s GST has been more than a decade in the making and is expected to make dodging taxes more difficult, bringing the nation’s vast cash economy into the mainstream. But its disruptive roll out and concerns about a widening gap between better-run companies and the laggards — often smaller firms and those in the informal sector — poses a challenge to Modi who rode to power in 2014 on the promise of more inclusive growth.

The difference for Mithun Chittilappilly, managing director at V-Guard Industries Ltd., which deals with both large and small companies, is down to how cash intensive a business was as well as how prepared they were to make the necessary accounting and technology changes. The consumer durable goods sector, which is more formalized, has better transitioned than others including electrical goods players, said Chittilappilly, whose company manufactures stabilizers, pumps, cables, electrical and solar water heaters. “In the case of the electrical trade, in many other parts of the country we saw that they were not doing really anything. There is a lot of unorganized sales happening,” he said, adding that many companies didn’t even have technology systems in place on July 1.

Technology Hiccups

Citigroup Inc. analysts Jamshed Dadabhoy, Aditya Mathur and Arvind Sharma traveled through the state of Madhya Pradesh in October to meet local companies, wholesalers and traders. In most conversations, owners indicated increased compliance costs and difficulties with the technology and network to upload tax invoices. On the other hand, Nisaba Godrej, executive chairwoman of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., said remaining “agile” helped her 120-year-old soap company navigate channel disruptions and deliver 10 percent volume growth. The gold and jewelry industry is another example of how organized retail has side-stepped any overall volume declines. Titan — which gets 80 percent of its revenue from jewelry — reported a 71 percent rise in second-quarter net profit from a year earlier and a 29 percent increase in sales. At the same time, gold consumption in India dropped to a seven-year low in 2016 as efforts to formalize purchases damped demand. Volumes will probably remain near last year’s level in 2017 as well, estimates the World Gold Council. “There are a few companies that are doing well from a market share capture perspective, like Titan Co. Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Hero Motocorp India and organized retailers, but we didn’t get the impression of an acceleration in demand yet,” the Citigroup analysts wrote in a report.

That view was shared by the chief of one of India’s largest electrical equipment manufacturer, Havells India’s Anil Rai Gupta. Businesses have been slow to replenish inventories that were emptied out before GST due to the uncertainty stemming from the new levies, he said. Billionaire Uday Kotak, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. expects companies in the informal sector to lose out unless they change the way they do business. “That is pretty straight forward. Players in the informal sector will realize that the old ways are dead. So either change or perish,” he said in an interview.

Small Traders

Credit Suisse analysts, Neelkanth Mishra and Prateek Singh cited surveys by Tally Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a software provider, to highlight the pain of many small enterprises. The surveys indicate businesses are holding back payments to their suppliers till they are convinced the supplier has paid the tax and uploaded the invoice. “This is because they are unsure they will get any credit,” they wrote in a report. “If this is systemic and not just a few anecdotes, it could slow down activity levels in many supply chains for several months.”

 ______ 
BONN: Set to become a legal entity in December, the India-led International Solar Alliance ISA ) plans to add 1,000 gigawatt (GW) of solar power across the globe by 2030 with an investment of nearly 1,200 billion euros.ISA's future plans were made public here in Bonn on the sidelines of the ongoing UN climate change conference (COP23).India had earlier planned to disclose details of ISA's agenda next month during the alliance's first global summit in Delhi. The inaugural summit has, however, now been deferred due to postponement of French President Emmanuel Macron 's India visit.Macron was earlier expected to attend the summit on December 9 during his India visit. The mega meet is now expected to be scheduled early next year, depending on availability of Macron and PM Narendra Modi ISA is India's brainchild and is meant to bring 121 solar rich countries on a single platform to explore ways to utilise and promote solar energy.The alliance was jointly launched by PM Modi and the then French President Francois Hollande in Paris on November 30, 2015. Since France had been quite active on this Indian initiative to forge a global coalition to harness solar energy, India is keen to have Macron on board at ISAs inaugural summit.""We have had discussion on the issue here with the French government's special envoy for implementation of ISA, Segolene Royal. Fresh dates are being explored, keeping in mind the availability of PM Modi and President Macron.The summit is likely to be held early next year,"" said Anand Kumar , secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy, on Tuesday. Kumar said member countries had been proactively working on their solar goals and achieving the target of 1,000GW by 2030 would be a collective goal.The current installed global capacity of solar power is around 303GW, including 12GW in India. Nearly 75GW of solar power was added globally in 2016. India had in 2015 revised its solar power target from 20 GW to 100 GW by 2022. So far, 44 countries have signed the ISA framework agreement.

**Modi remains 'by far' most popular figure in Indian politics: Pew survey** 

 ______ 
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal +

economy is ""very good +

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains ""by far"" the most popular figure in Indian politics, the Pew said today, releasing the main findings of its latest survey conducted among 2,464 respondents in India.Modi at 88 per cent is 30 points ahead of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (58%), 31 points ahead of Congress president Sonia Gandhi (57%) and 49 points ahead of(39%), said the survey conducted between February 21 and March 10 this year.Pew said the public's ""positive assessment"" of Modi is buoyed by ""growing contentment"" with the Indian economy: more than eight-in-ten say economic conditions are ""good"", up 19 percentage points since immediately before the 2014 election.The share of adults who say the"" (30%) has tripled in the past three years, it added.Overall, seven-in-ten Indians are now ""satisfied"" with the way things are going in the country. This positive assessment of India's direction has nearly doubled since 2014, Pew said.According to Pew, at least nine-in-ten Indians in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana and in the western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh hold a favorable view of the prime minister.The same is true for more than eight-in-ten in the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal and the northern states of Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.""Since 2015, Modi's popularity is relatively unchanged in the north, has risen in the west and the south, and is down slightly in the east,"" it said.Notably, the survey reflects a 21 percentage points drop in favorable view of America among Indians from 70% in 2015 to just 49% in 2017.Only 40 per cent express confidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs, down 34 points from their faith in his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015.Same is the case with China, whose favorability rating among Indians have dropped from 41 per cent in 2015 to 26% in 2017. The survey was conducted before the Doklam crisis.According to Pew Survey, despite periodic outbreaks of religious violence, relatively few Indians see communal relations as a very big problem.""Similarly, despite Prime Minister Modi's decision last November to abolish high-value bank notes, less than half of the Indian population sees the lack of availability of cash to be a major problem,"" it said.

**Amid Modi wave, Arvind Kejriwal's popularity wanes: Pew survey** 

 ______ 
a figure that has barely altered since 2015 +

88 per cent of Indians hold a favourable opinion of Modi, while nearly 70 per cent view him very favourably,, the one-year milestone of his term as Prime Minister.At least nine-in-ten Indians in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana and in the western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh hold a favorable view of the prime minister. The same is true for more than eight-in-ten in the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal and the northern states of Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.Public support for PM Modi far exceeds that enjoyed by his political allies and rivals. PM Modi ranks 30 points higher than Congress scion Rahul Gandhi at 88 per cent, and 49 points above Delhi chief minister and AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal , making him the the most popular figure in Indian politics.While majority of adults hold a favourable opinion opinion of Rahul Gandhi and his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, public backing for Arvind Kejriwal has waned. After capturing the public imagination with a massive anti-corruption campaign, Kejriwal's popularity has consistently dipped after coming to power in Delhi in 2015. Two years on, only 39 per cent Indians view him in a favourable light.The PM's popularity is buoyed by the public's satisafction with his handling of domestic issues. At least seven in ten Indians approve of how he has helped the poor and handled unemployment, terrorism and corruption.Public approval of his handling of corruption is up 11 points and support for his dealings with terrorism is up 10 points.As a result, more than 85 per cent trust the NDA government, with nearly 79 per cent quite satisfied with the way the Indian democracy is currently working. Overall, BJP supporters are more trusting and satisfied with the Centre's performance than Congress backers.PM Modi's lowest ratings are for his handling of communal relations, with 50 per cent Indians critical of his policy with regards to the Hindu-Muslim dynamic and caste politics. Moreover, 52 per cent people are dissatisfied with his efforts to curb air pollution. Women (48 per cent) are particularly critical of how he has dealt with the issue of price rise.86 per cent adults believe the military has a good influence, although the intensity of that support is even greater at 62 per cent. Again, BJP supporters (63 per cent) are more likely than Congress party backers (46 per cent) to say the influence of the military is very good.Around 67 per cent Indians hold the view that human rights organizations and the police are a good influence.While most Indians expressed great satisfaction with the country's democratic apparatus, 53 per cent of them also support military rule.At 55 per cent, support for autocratic rule is higher in India than in any other nation surveyed. And India is one of only four nations where half or more of the public supports governing by the military.Roughly 66 per cent Indians say a good way to govern the country would be experts, not elected officials, making decisions according to what they think is best for the nation.About seven in ten people say that life in India is better than it was 50 years ago. Only 17 per cent say life is worse.Despite a recent economic slowdown, Indians are upbeat about both current economic conditions and the future of their economy. More than 83 per cent Indians say the nation's economy is good, and 30 per cent say it is very good.Despite Prime Minister Modi's decision last November to abolish high-value bank notes, less than half of the Indian population (45 per cent) sees the lack of availability of cash to be a major problem. It is noteworthy that the Pew survey was conducted during February 21 to March 10, 2017, when the process of remonetisation following the note ban was still underway.

**Secular word is the biggest lie, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath** 

 ______ 
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (File Photo) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (File Photo)

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the word “secular” was the “biggest lie” that has been told since Independence, and has damaged the country. The BJP leader also said that “distorting history was no less a crime than sedition”, and claimed that the word “Paki” was the “biggest insult” used in Europe.

Responding to a question on communalism and secularism at a function organised by the Dainik Jagran group in Raipur, Adityanath said, “Mera maanna hai ki azadi ke baad Bharat mein sabse bada jhooth dharmnirpeksh shabd hai. Nagrikon ke saath, Bharat ke logon ke saath… un logon ko maafi maangni chahiye, jinhone is shabd ko janm diya aur jo yeh shabd istemaal karte hai… koi vyavastha dharmnirpeksh nahin ho sakti. Rajneetik vyavastha panthnirpeksh ho sakti hai. Agar koi humse kahega ki shasan us upasna vidhi se chalni chahiye, toh nahin chal sakti. UP ke andar dekhunga to 22 crore logon ko dekhna hoga. Mein in logon ke suraksha ke prati, unki bhavnaon ke prati javabdeh hoon. Lekin ek samuday ka dushtikaran karne ke liye bhi nahin baitha hoon. Panthnirpeksh ho lekin dharmnirpeksh nahin ho sakta” (I believe that the word secular is the biggest lie since Independence. Those that have given birth to this lie and those that use it should apologise to the people and this country. No system can be secular. Political system can be sect-neutral. If someone were to say that government has to be run by one way of prayer, that is not possible. In UP, I have to look at 22 crore people and I am answerable for their security and their feelings. But I am not sitting here to ruin one community either. You can be sect-neutral but not secular).

Referring to India’s standing in the West during the interaction, Adityanath claimed that the words “Pakistan” and “Paki” carried a derogatory connotation in Europe. “Europe mein sabse badi apmaan-janak shabd hai to voh Paki shabd hai. Pakistan shabd hi gaali ka prayaylay ho gaya hai (Paki has become an scornful word in Europe. The word Pakistan itself has become a synonym for abuse),” he said.

Earlier, delivering a short address at the interaction, Adityanath said, “Itihas ko tod-marod ke prastut karna, rashtradroh se kam nahin (Distorting history is no less a crime that sedition).”

The UP Chief Minister also attended a felicitation organised by the BJP in a separate function at the indoor stadium in Raipur, where he targeted the Congress for committing mistakes that led to terrorism, Naxalism and separatism in parts of the country.

“Congress ne is desh ki mool bhavnayon ke saath khilvaad kiya. Apne swarth ke liye is desh ko jaati ke naam par, bhasha ke naam par, kshetra ke naam par vibhajit kya. Desh mein kahin aatankvaad, kahin naxalvaad, kahin algavaad ko janm diya. Uksi keemat ye desh aaj bhi chuka raha hai… Humare liye sampoorna Bharat ek parivar hai. (The Congress played with the core emotions of this country. For its own selfish aims, it divided the country on the lines of caste, region, language. There is terrorism somewhere, Naxalism somewhere, separatism somewhere. We are still paying the price… for us, the entire country is one complete family),” he said.

Comparing the Narendra Modi government to “Ram Rajya”, he said that while the Prime Minister understands the pain of the people, the Congress does not.

Adityanath said that Chhattisgarh goes to polls in exactly a year and exhorted BJP workers to begin preparations. The BJP was out in full force at the party event, with slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” renting the air, and many Chhattisgarh ministers garlanding Adityanath and touching his feet.

**Over 1 Lakh Jobs Created In US By Indian Companies, Says Report** 

 ______ 
**Washington**

: Indian companies have created more than 113,000 jobs in the US and invested
nearly $18 billion in the country, according to an annual report which gives a
state-by-state breakdown of the tangible investments made and jobs created by
100 Indian firms doing business in America and Puerto Rico. The report, titled
'Indian Roots, American Soil', released by the Confederation of Indian
Industry (CII) on Tuesday, states that Indian companies have also contributed
$147 million towards corporate social responsibility and $588 million as
research and development expenditures in the US.

Together, 100 Indian companies employ 113,423 people across 50 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the report said, adding that the total
value of tangible investments made by these companies exceeds $17.9 billion.

The top five states in which Indian companies have generated maximum
employment are New Jersey (8,572 jobs), Texas (7,271 jobs), California (6,749
jobs), New York (5,135 jobs) and Georgia (4,554 jobs).

According to the report, the top five states in which Indian companies have
contributed the highest foreign direct investment are New York ($1.57
billion), New Jersey ($1.56 billion), Massachusetts ($931 million), California
($542 million) and Wyoming ($435 million). The average amount of investment
received from Indian companies per state/territory is $187 million, the report
said, noting that 85 per cent of the companies plan to make more investments
in the US.

As many as 87 per cent of the companies plan to hire more employees locally in
the next five years.

Indian industry and professionals are making significant contributions to the
US economy, said Indian Ambassador to the US Navtej Sarna.

""The presence and reach of Indian companies continue to grow each year as they
invest billions of dollars and create jobs across the United States,"" he said.

Industry body CII's director general, Chandrajit Banerjee, said the story of
Indian investment in the US is one that showcases how intertwined the two
countries are that contribute to each other's success.

Indian firms are among the fastest growing investors in the US, contributing
to growth and job creation in the US economy, said Senator Chris Van Hollen.

As the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy, a strong
US-India partnership is vital for the 21st century, said Congressman Ami Bera.

The friendship between the two countries has continued to grow under President
Trump's administration, said Congressman Pete Sessions.

Indian businesses have brought hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands
of jobs to Texas and, at the same time, the reforms led by Prime Minister Modi
have opened doors for American companies to expand their operations in India,
he said.

""I am glad to see, as CII's event today proves, bonds between our nations -
both commercial and strategic - continue to grow stronger,"" Mr Sessions said.

""According to CII's survey, Indian companies in Virginia have invested over
$37 million in my state, and I can only hope that they will continue to invest
in Virginia and that our engagement with these companies will continue to
grow,"" said Congressman David Brat.

In addition to spurring economic activity, particularly in North Carolina,
this type of investment serves to strengthen the bond between our two
countries, said Congressman George Holding.

The report shows that Indian companies have invested over $195 million in the
state of Illinois, and created over 3,800 jobs, said Congressman Raja
Krishnamoorthi.

""I hope that Indian companies continue to put down roots and invest in our
state, as our economy and community are strengthened by their engagement with
us,"" he said.

""As the largest India-headquartered multinational in North America, the Tata
Group has had operations and investments in the US market for many decades,""
said James Shapiro, resident director North America of Tata Sons Ltd.

Ravi Kumar, president and Deputy COO, Infosys said his company began working
with its first US client over 35 years ago and, have worked to boost American
innovation ever since.

""Earlier this year, we announced plans to hire 10,000

American workers over the next two years, partnering with local colleges and
universities to shrink the IT skills gap in the US, and are focused on
upskilling and reskilling workers seeking to grow their careers in computer
science,"" he said.

The work of Infosys Foundation USA has benefited over 4,700,000 students,
13,000 teachers and 21,000 schools across all 50 states in America since 2015,
he asserted.

I was born into a BJP worshipping household. My parents still go gaga over Modi and every shit he takes. I was not told this or that by anyone. I was very pro-BJP until 2015, then Akhlaq Khan died and BJP while conveniently asking us not to use cow politics for politics, went ahead and used 'cow' to campaign in Bihar.  It takes special kind of moron to believe that those two events were not related and BJP does not have a tangential had at best in Dadri lynching. I have read pro BJP stuff, anti-BJP stuff, and somehow, the anti makes much more sense. You can go back and check my answer to a Nehru thread I wrote in a few days back, its a quite long answer. Its easy to continue believing in what parents drilled in, I atleast went a step back and thought and then changed my views.

And as I said above, BJP deserves the most scrutiny because they are in power, and with the potential to cause most damage (@% of GDP is not a small number btw). If Congress wins or AAp wins, I will observe them not as a Bhakt but like I do with BJP now, bcs once they are in power they dont deserve asskissing. I am a customer of political parties, they provide service. I am under no delusion that they or them are always going to do everything right, and somebody else is not.

Willing to bet with an educated guess based on my experience of field research that they hardly asked 80-90 people from Tamil Nadu, and even that is being generous.

Same. My family were apolitical CPI-M supporters for a while.



&gt; (2 % of GDP is not a small number btw). 


What part of ""a post-GST short-term slowdown was unavoidable"" did you not understand? Worldwide, a big structural change like GST has alway led to a period of adjustment. Though you should rejoice, most governments haven't been successfully reelected after a GST launch. The long-term benefits to the economic growth are proven though.


 
&gt; I am under no delusion that they or them are always going to do everything right, and somebody else is not. 


Why do you think I believe the BJP is always right? I don't agree with Aadhar's forceful imposition, for example, or some of the Socialist moves. I also believe they have dilly-dallied too much with wider reforms like land &amp; labor, and privatisations. Though I also understand the priority has to be to avoid a ""Shining India"" moment, which RaGa was attempting with his brilliant ""suit-boot ki sarkar"" jibe.




&gt; Politics is always a choice between few options, we dont have luxury to wait for a dream candidate, 


Exactly. This is why I support Modi. Is he the best possible candidate? No. Is he the best from what we have? By a huge margin. Imo, Modi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RaGa &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AK.

He's pretty anti-Modi now.

Now from one of my earlier [comments,](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6uzq5i/arvind_kejriwals_speech_from_2006_when_he_won/dlx0x29/) here are a few reasons I dislike Arvind Kejriwalji:



1. Dangerous politics: Supporting Hardik Patel and Kanhaiya Kumar; and evoking dangerous Khalistani sentiments. 




2. Separate manifestos for targeted communities, including Dalits. If this is not pandering to votebanks, I don't know what is.




3. Subsidise everything, but provide the subsidies selectively (No tenants, etc. [Unless AAP won the MCD elections,](http://www.india.com/news/india/mcd-elections-2017-arvind-kejriwal-vows-to-provide-free-water-and-subsidised-electricity-to-delhi-tenants-if-aap-comes-to-power-1987207/) which they didn't). 



4. Surgical strikes. I almost never use the phrase, but AK's behaviour in this case was anti-national. Pro-Pak Twitter handles loved him though. Then, he once tweeted [a Pro-Pak and Anti-India article](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Twitter-explodes-with-rage-after-Arvind-Kejriwal-tweets-anti-India-article/articleshow/54562005.cms) I don't even know why. This was literally undermining our foreign policy stance, and AK's supposedly a CM.




5. Blatant hypocrisy and lack of values: Hugging Lalu, tie-ing up with INC, supporting Chitfund Didi. 



6. Blatant opportunism: Immediately turning on an ascendant BJP and gunning for the PM post rather than focusing on their promised objective of ending corruption in Delhi for 5 years and building a base. 



7. Disgusting tweets unbecoming of a CM. 




8. Sheer ego and arrogance: Claim to be the only moral authority, giving ""Corruption-Free Certificates."" Threw out Yogendra Yadav and anyone even slightly critical of him, and it will be Kumar Vishwas' turn soon. 




9. Constant drama and whining. The degree fiasco. All the bullshit of having ""proof"" which he never released on Sheila Dixit, Jaitley, Modi, and numerous others. AK has pioneered blame-game politics, a kind of disgusting hit and run. I hope the defamation cases teach him a lesson. Then, there's the EVM fiasco. This is similar to Mamata's claims of a planned coup a few months earlier, interestingly after a meeting with Kejru.




10. Impressively, single-handedly destroy the hopes of another credible third party rising in the near future. No one will trust it. All the established parties have to do is compare any new entrant to Kejriwal, and voters will flee in droves.



11. Finally, I will let Anna Hazare end my unplanned rant: [Arvind Kejriwal has dashed my hopes: Anna Hazare](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rKOEW4F1htvcGejlPYJfDJ/Arvind-Kejriwal-has-dashed-my-hopes-Anna-Hazare.html)

**Narendra Modi by far the most popular figure in Indian politics: Pew Research** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains “by far” the most popular figure in Indian politics, the Pew Research Center, an American think tank, said Wednesday, releasing the main findings of its latest survey conducted among 2,464 respondents in India.

Modi at 88% is 30 points ahead of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi (58%), 31 points ahead of Congress president Sonia Gandhi (57%) and 49 points ahead of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal (39%), said the survey conducted between February 21 and March 10 this year.

Pew said the public’s “positive assessment” of Modi is buoyed by “growing contentment” with the Indian economy: more than eight-in-ten say economic conditions are “good”, up 19 percentage points since immediately before the 2014 election.

The share of adults who say the economy is “very good” (30%) has tripled in the past three years, it added.

Overall, seven-in-ten Indians are now “satisfied” with the way things are going in the country. This positive assessment of India’s direction has nearly doubled since 2014, Pew said.

According to Pew, at least nine-in-ten Indians in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana and in the western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh hold a favorable view of the prime minister.

The same is true for more than eight-in-ten in the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal and the northern states of Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

“Since 2015, Modi’s popularity is relatively unchanged in the north, has risen in the west and the south, and is down slightly in the east,” it said.

Notably, the survey reflects a 21 percentage points drop in favourable view of America among Indians from 70% in 2015 to just 49% in 2017.

Only 40% express confidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs, down 34 points from their faith in his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015.

Same is the case with China, whose favourability rating among Indians have dropped from 41% in 2015 to 26%in 2017. The survey was conducted before the Doklam crisis.

According to Pew Survey, despite periodic outbreaks of religious violence, relatively few Indians see communal relations as a very big problem.

“Similarly, despite Prime Minister Modi’s decision last November to abolish high-value bank notes, less than half of the Indian population sees the lack of availability of cash to be a major problem,” it said.

**In Gujarat, BJP Plans To Drop 35 MLAs, 6 Ministers As Candidates: Sources** 

 ______ 
Gujarat Election 2017: PM Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah held a meeting last
night to discuss candidates

**Ahmedabad: **

By 2 pm, Bhushan Bhatt has clocked several hours at the BJP office in
Ahmedabad, hoping for good news. Mr Bhatt is the incumbent lawmaker from one
of the city's 182 constituencies. He is still not sure if the party will give
him a chance to run again.

Sources in the BJP, which has governed Gujarat for 22 years in a row, say that
it plans to drop 35 of its 121 MLAs; among those who may be axed are six
ministers, reportedly.

That's why Mr Bhatt is sweating it.

""If the party directs me, I will go all guns blazing; if it says no, I will
still work like a dedicated party worker,"" he claimed, as all aspiring
candidates are known to do.

Just days to go for candidates to start the contest by filing their papers,
neither the BJP nor the Congress has disclosed even a first cut of contenders.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his closest aide, BJP chief Amit Shah, held a
lengthy meeting last night in Delhi to

discuss candidates for next month's election

. Sources said 150 candidates are likely to be announced within the next two
days.

""Discussions have taken place, list will be out at the appropriate time,"" said
union minister JP Nadda.

For the BJP, a victory isn't enough. Mr Shah has said 150 of a total of 182
seats is what his party must acquire in honour of the PM, who led the state
for three terms before getting the country's top job. The Gujarat election is
the first test of the new national sales tax or GST; the clumsy roll out in
July included complex multi-rate tax slabs and required elaborate and
confusing returns to be filed. Many of the kinks have been ironed out - 178
items were moved out recently from the highest tax slab of 28%, seen partly as
an attempt by the government to win back traders who were upset in Gujarat
with the tax.

Gujarat Assembly Elections 2017: Amit Shah did door-to-door campaigning for
the elections

Though the Goods and Services Tax or GST has been praised as a sound
structural reform, its introduction while the country was still recovering
from the shock move to ban high-value notes a year ago, contributed to an
economic lull with the last quarter registering as the weakest in three years
with a growth rate of 5.7%.

Then there's the fact that the Congress, long the bridesmaid in Gujarat, is
showing a new aggression in its campaign, bold-facing the economic problems
and repeatedly making the point that there's a growing scarcity of jobs.

Three young caste leaders in Gujarat have hitched their wagons to the
Congress. Among them is

Hardik Patel

, the 24-year-old leader of the Patidar community. He has accused the BJP of
betraying decades of support by the Patidars by not extending affirmative
action policies to them. The Patidars form about 14% of the population in
Gujarat, but their traditional prosperity allowed them disproportionate
influence. A third of the BJP's MLAs are Patels; the current government has
nine Patel ministers.

Sources say that in an attempt to cancel out Hardik Patel's appeal to the
community to vote for the Congress, the BJP is keen on selecting new and young
Patidar candidates particularly in Saurashtra where Hardik Patel holds
particular sway.

The Congress is not short of math to do either. Hardik Patel wants a chunk of
seats for his caste with a say in deciding who gets them; so does

Alpesh Thakore

, the young leader of OBCs or Other Backward Castes who recently joined the
Congress. It's all good, the Congress insists. ""There is no pressure from
Alpesh Thakore or Hardik Patel for tickets. They have just given their
suggestions and based on the winnability factor, a decision will be taken,""
said Manish Doshi, a Congress spokesman.

The party had earlier assured all its 57 legislators that they would all have
the chance to run again. 14 of them have quit the party since then. Despite
that, the divvying up is proving complicated.

It appears that the BJP will beat the Congress to announcing candidates.
Voting is scheduled for December 8 and 14. Results will be known on December
18.

**9 out of 10 Indians approve of Narendra Modi, says Pew survey** 

 ______ 
The Pew survey results come against the backdrop of criticism of the way the Narendra Modi govt has been handling the Indian economy, especially in light of reforms such as demonetisation and GST. Photo: Photo: HT

New Delhi: Almost nine out of 10 Indians hold a favourable opinion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and more than two-thirds are satisfied with the direction in which he is taking the country, according to the findings of a survey by US-based Pew Research Center released Thursday.

Modi’s rating of 88% includes 69% people who express a very favourable opinion of him, said the Pew survey. And this number was 31 percentage points higher than that for Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

The survey was conducted between 21 February and 10 March—a little more than three months after Modi announced demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes on 8 November to curb corruption and unearth black money. It gathered the opinion of about 2,500 people from across 16 of India’s most populous states in the poll conduct in eight languages.

The survey results come against the backdrop of criticism of the way Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has been handling the Indian economy, especially in light of reforms such as demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST). The prime minister has also faced flak for India’s slowing economic growth and for failing to generate jobs needed for the approximately one million youth joining the workforce each month.

“Three years into Modi’s five-year tenure, the honeymoon period for his administration may be over, but the public’s love affair with current conditions in India is even more intense,” a note explaining the results of the survey said.

Modi completed three years in office on 26 May this year and has some 18 months to go before 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Pew survey noted that the highest approval ratings for Modi of 95% came from the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, followed by the western and central states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Chattisgarh at 92%. Gujarat is to go to the polls in two stages next month with results due on 18 December.

“Young Indians, those aged 18 to 29, show slightly greater intensity of support (for Modi) than their elders, ages 50 and older,” the note said, adding “no other major political figure in India approaches Modi’s level of public support”.

Despite the slowdown in the Indian economy, “there is absolutely no disagreement between different demographic groups about India’s economic situation. Overwhelmingly all groups believe that the economy is doing well including three quarters of Congress party supporters”, Bruce Stokes, director (global economic attitudes) of Pew Research Center, told an audience at Brookings India, in New Delhi on Thursday.

But 73% of those polled said “a lack of employment opportunities is a very big problem in India”, the note said adding 74% cited corrupt officials as a problem and 76% said terrorism was a very big challenge.

“Despite periodic outbreaks of religious violence, relatively few Indians see communal relations as a very big problem. Similarly, despite Prime Minister Modi’s decision last November to abolish high-value bank notes, less than half of the Indian population sees the lack of availability of cash to be a major problem,” the note said.

According to the survey, “about six-in-ten Indians expressed a positive opinion of the Congress party”, a note explaining the survey findings on the Pew website said. “But the gap between BJP and Congress backing, which was 26 points in 2015 and then narrowed to 13 points in 2016, has now widened again to 25 points. Indians in rural areas (63%) are more supportive of Congress than those in cities (51%). Those with a primary education or less are more likely to back Congress than are those with at least some college education,” the note said.

Interestingly, the survey found that 60% of Congress supporters have a favourable view of the BJP while only 45% of BJP backers hold a positive opinion of the Congress.

**Moody's upgrades India's rating citing government reforms** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: International rating agency Moody 's has upgraded India's local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Baa2 from Baa3 and changed the outlook on the rating to stable from positive. The rating agency has cited the government's implementation of its reform programme which includes introduction of the Goods and Services Tax , Aadhaar system of biometric accounts and direct benefit transfer schemes and measures taken to address bad loans in the banking system.The rating upgrade comes after a gap of 13 years - Moody's had last upgraded India's rating to 'Baa3' in 2004.The immediate impact of the rating upgrade is that the cost of international borrowing will become cheaper for Indian government and Indian corporates whose ratings are constrained by the sovereign rating. Issuers of lower rated paper have to pay higher rates to make up for the perceived credit risk. The move will also improve the sentiment in the equity markets.""Moody's believes that those (reforms) implemented to date will advance the government's objective of improving the business climate, enhancing productivity, stimulating foreign and domestic investment, and ultimately fostering strong and sustainable growth. The reform program will thus complement the existing shock-absorbance capacity provided by India's strong growth potential and improving global competitiveness,"" the rating agency said in a statement today.The upgrade comes as a major boost to the Narendra Modi government which has been under fire for the fallout of GST and demonetisation on business. ""The decision to upgrade the ratings is underpinned by Moody's expectation that continued progress on economic and institutional reforms will, over time, enhance India's high growth potential and its large and stable financing base for government debt, and will likely contribute to a gradual decline in the general government debt burden over the medium term. In the meantime, while India's high debt burden remains a constraint on the country's credit profile, Moody's believes that the reforms put in place have reduced the risk of a sharp increase in debt, even in potential downside scenarios,"" said the rating agency in a statement.Demonetisation which has been facing severe criticism after most of the currency was returned to banks has also been viewed positively by Moody's. ""Government efforts to reduce corruption, formalize economic activity and improve tax collection and administration, including through demonetization and GST, both illustrate and should contribute to the further strengthening of India's institutions,"" the agency said.On the fiscal front, efforts to improve transparency and accountability, including through adoption of a new Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, are expected to enhance India's fiscal policy framework and strengthen policy credibility. The other reforms which have helped in the upgrade are the legislation towards fiscal responsibility and the shift to a monetary policy committee for interest rate setting. ""Adoption of a flexible inflation targeting regime and the formation of a Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) have already enhanced the transparency and efficiency of monetary policy in India. Inflation has declined markedly and foreign exchange reserves have increased to all-time highs, creating significant policy buffers to absorb potential shocks,"" Moody's said.

**Free LPG scheme: 18 months after PM Modi launched Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, very few drop out** 

 ______ 
A year and half after the launch of the Modi government’s flagship Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the average rate of LPG cylinder refills by the beneficiaries stands at an annual 3.7 per connection issued. (Image: Reuters)

A year and half after the launch of the Modi government’s flagship Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the average rate of LPG cylinder refills by the beneficiaries stands at an annual 3.7 per connection issued. Though this is lower than the national average of around 7.5 refills annually for 2016-17, analysts said the PMUY refill rate doesn’t indicate any unravelling of the scheme. Among the states, while Gujarat, Bihar and Uttarakhand are among the top with more than 4 cylinder refills a year, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have witnessed less than three refills a year per connection. PMUY was launched in May 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and aims to put 5 crore LPG connections within three years in the kitchens of women belonging to the below-poverty-line (BPL) households as per the Socio-Economic and Caste Census 2011 data. The scheme has been a success as more than 3 crore connections have already been issued.

In fact, given the early success of the scheme, the petroleum ministry is expected to write to the finance ministry for an additional grant of Rs 4,800 crore for issuing another 3 crore connections, as reported by FE. The government has budgeted Rs 8,000 crore for the first 5 crore connections and it claims that 85% of the beneficiaries have come back to refill LPG cylinders. Though the refilling rate by PMUY beneficiaries is low compared with the national average, experts say it should be viewed in the context of the user profile. “A poor household may not cook multiple times or boil water, for instance, and so they consume less. By that way, the refiling rate seems reasonable,” said former petroleum secretary TNR Rao.

While there are outlier states, most states such as Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Punjab and Jharkhand have witnessed an annual refill rate of 3.5 cylinders. As per a report by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), an arm of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, easy access to free firewood in forest areas was one of the primary barriers to the adoption of LPG as cooking fuel. The study, though conducted in June 2016, was put up on the website of PPAC on October 31, 2017. The survey collected data from 1.03 lakh households without LPG connections across 120 districts in 13 states. Other barriers included access to free cowdung cakes and biomass.

In financial terms, 86% of the respondents of the survey said the high initial cost for deposit and the price of gas stove were a barrier whereas high recurring cost of the cylinder was a barrier for 83% of the respondents. Kalpana Jain, senior director with Deloitte India, agrees. “Probably they (BPL households) may not have the affordability even at the subsidised price,” Jain said, adding that poor households have shorter cooking periods. Under PMUY, while half of the initial cost of around Rs 3,200 per connection is borne by the government, the rest is to be paid by the beneficiary either upfront or through instalments which are settled by not paying back the subsidy into bank accounts while refilling.

**Modi only world statesman to stand up to China on BRI: Pillsbury** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only world statesman to have stood up to China's Belt and Road Initiative even though the US has been silent on the ambitious project till recently, a top American expert on China said today.

During a Congressional hearing, Michael Pillsbury, Director of Center on Chinese Strategy at the prestigious think-tank Hudson Institute, told lawmakers that Modi and his team have been quite outspoken against Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious project.

""The only statesman in the world who stood up to it yet, is Prime Minister Modi. He and his team have been quite outspoken, partly because the Belt and Road Initiative includes violation of Indian sovereign claims, Pillsbury said.

""But the US government, until now and this is a five- year-old initiative if you count the early part of it, has been silent, he said.

Praising the Trump administration for its new Indo- Pacific strategy, the former Pentagon official said in recent days people have heard more than 50 times by members of the Trump administration including the president himself mentioning ""free and open"" Indo-Pacific region.

""The Chinese have already attacked this. They don't like it, said Pillsbury, who is considered an authority on China- related issues.

""The Indians, fairly recently, were joking about we want to make the Indian Ocean the Indian Ocean, by which they meant the purchase of several billion dollars worth of American PA aircraft, which have weapon systems in the back that can sink ships, frankly, and other improvements including maritime situational awareness and a big new center in Delhi where the Indians can keep track of both blue holes and grey holes going through the Indian Ocean, he said.

""Chinese are very angry about this. They have criticised the Obama administration for its effort to, as they say, boost India, to a higher rank order in comprehensive power than the Chinese believe India deserves, the top American expert on China said in response to a question.

Senator Ed Markey said China's signature Belt and Road Initiative that aims to position China as the uncontested leading power in Asia ""may further coerce"" its neighbours through loans they cannot repay.

The BRI aimed at building a vast network of infrastructure projects expanding China's expertise and capital to different parts of the world includes USD 50 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) over which India has protested as it traversed through Pakistan- occupied-Kashmir (PoK).

India boycotted the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) organised by China in May this year to highlight its concerns over Beijing pushing projects through the the PoK.

He said the US companies face the threat of intellectual property theft with reports that China has been stealing cutting-edge research as well as sensitive trade secrets from the US.

And that includes companies working in the clean energy sector who cannot compete with state-backed firms, he alleged.

Pillsbury said Chinese are offering low interest loans to countries that cannot afford it.

""We're already saw the example of Sri Lanka, which fell behind in its payments and then was the subject of coercion that if you transfer the main port here in Sri Lanka to Chinese control, we will forgive the debt. The Sri Lankans did it, he said.

There were concerns of debt burden brought in by the BRI projects after Sri Lanka opted for long-term lease of its Hambantota port for USD 1.12 billion debt swap.

""...So we are beginning to see, just through the media, what the Belt and Road Initiative may mean, Pillsbury told the lawmakers.

Senator Markey said China is challenging the very underpinnings of the global order that has brought peace and prosperity.

China has not lived up to its international obligations to help denuclearise the Korean Peninsula, he said.

""No country has greater leverage than China, which is responsible for approximately 90 per cent of North Korean trade,"" he noted.

Markey said, ""China is challenging the international system elsewhere as well. It has constructed in violation of international law, military bases on artificial islands and disputed areas of the South China Sea.""

""Through economic coercion, Beijing undermined the sovereignty of its smaller neighbours and countries including South Korea and the Philippines face Chinese retaliation for taking legal and sovereign actions in their own defence,""

Finally they have come around. The view must have been taken with next 10 years in mind. 

The structural reforms being undertaken by Modi are far deeper for  a fiscal slippage for a year or two to undo. 

This is a seminal change. It's so huge and exiting word fails me to define it. 

The impact would be very significant, in long term and short term as well. 

Each sovereign rating upgrade means a permanent impact of 30-50bps or so impact on 10 year gsec yield (quoting from memory, there was a study). Huge amount of pension money will have much higher incremental weightages for investing in each of the higher rating category sovereign bonds.

**Sheen intact, but PM Modi falling short in fight against communalism, pollution: Pew poll** 

 ______ 
a survey by the Pew Reseach Center +

NEW DELHI: Past the three-year mark as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi continues to retain his popularity according tothat says nine out of 10 respondents hold a favourable opinion of the leader and approve of how the country is doing.A survey of 2,464 respondents during February 21 to March 10 this year found that Modi enjoys stronger support in south India, where 95% of the respondents were favourably disposed as opposed to only 4% who disapproved. The figures were high across the country with as many as 88% supporting the Prime Minister.The Modi appeal was visible with regard to other political rivals as well. While the survey found a 57% approval rating for Sonia Gandhi , it was 58% for Rahul Gandhi AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal came a distant fourth at 39%. These percentages are the result of a yes-no question regarding individual leaders.Modi's lowest ratings are for handling of communal relations, at 50%, and for his efforts towards curbing air pollution, at 48%. Women are particularly critical of how he has dealt with communal relations, as are people in north India. Rural Indians are less supportive than those in urban areas of his handling of both communal relations and air pollution.The interesting bit is that the survey shows BJP continues to enjoy public support.The Pew Survey notes that more than eight in 10 Indians have a favourable view of the party as against six in 10 who expressed support for Congress. ""But the gap between BJP and Congress backing, which was 26 points in 2015 and then narrowed to 13 points in 2016, has now widened again to 25 points,"" the Pew survey notes.Indians in rural areas (63%) are more supportive of Congress than those in cities (51%). The survey said 85% of those surveyed trust the government to do what is right for India while 79% are satisfied with the way democracy is working in India.Nearly three-quarters (73%) of the sample group said a lack of employment opportunities is a major problem in India. Of course, a comparable share (72%) approved of the PM's handling of this issue, an assessment which is up 10 points over 2016.A similar share of respondents cited corrupt officials (74%) and terrorism (76%) as big challenges, and roughly seven in 10 Indians approved of Modi's record in dealing with the problems.Approval of his handling of corruption is up 11 points and support for his dealings with terrorism is up 10 points. Rural Indians view the PM's handling of corruption less favourably than city dwellers.

**Moody's backs Modi, upgrades India's sovereign rating for first time in 14 years** 

 ______ 
International rating agency Moody 's Investors Service has upgraded India 's local and foreign currency issuer ratings to Baa2 from Baa3 and changed the outlook on the rating to stable from positive.The rating agency has revised the sovereign rating of India a notch above investment grade after a long gap of 14 years. Interestingly, the last time the global rating has revised the rating was when the BJP government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in power.Moody's has also upgraded India's local currency senior unsecured rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and its short-term local currency rating to P-2 from P-3, according to a statement from the agency.""The decision to upgrade the ratings is underpinned by Moody's expectation that continued progress on economic and institutional reforms will, over time, enhance India's high growth potential and its large and stable financing base for government debt, and will likely contribute to a gradual decline in the general government debt burden over the medium term,"" it said.In the meantime, while India's high debt burden remains a constraint on the country's credit profile, Moody's believes that the reforms put in place have reduced the risk of a sharp increase in debt, even in potential downside scenarios, it said.Moody's has also raised India's long-term foreign-currency bond ceiling to Baa1 from Baa2, and the long-term foreign-currency bank deposit ceiling to Baa2 from Baa3. The short-term foreign-currency bond ceiling remains unchanged at P-2, and the short-term foreign-currency bank deposit ceiling has been raised to P-2 from P-3. The long-term local currency deposit and bond ceilings remain unchanged at A1.The government is mid-way through a wide-ranging program of economic and institutional reforms, it said adding that while a number of important reforms remain at the design phase,""Moody's believes that those implemented to date will advance the government's objective of improving the business climate, enhancing productivity, stimulating foreign and domestic investment, and ultimately fostering strong and sustainable growth. The reform program will thus complement the existing shock-absorbance capacity provided by India's strong growth potential and improving global competitiveness,"" it said.Key elements of the reform program include the recently-introduced Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) which will, among other things, promote productivity by removing barriers to interstate trade; improvements to the monetary policy framework; measures to address the overhang of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking system; and measures such as demonetization, the Aadhaar system of biometric accounts and targeted delivery of benefits through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system intended to reduce informality in the economy , it said. Other important measures which have yet to reach fruition include planned land and labor market reforms, which rely to a great extent on cooperation with and between the States, it added.""Most of these measures will take time for their impact to be seen, and some, such as the GST and demonetization, have undermined growth over the near term,"" it said adding that Moody's expects real GDP growth to moderate to 6.7% in the fiscal year ending in March 2018 (FY2017).However, as disruption fades, assisted by recent government measures to support SMEs and exporters with GST compliance, real GDP growth will rise to 7.5% in FY2018, with similarly robust levels of growth from FY2019 onward, it said.Longer term, India's growth potential is significantly higher than most other Baa-rated sovereigns, it added.

**Blog: Ravish Kumar On An Insignificant Man And What It Exposes** 

 ______ 
The irony may make you chuckle. Just a day after a survey from the other side
of the world told you that 55 per cent of Indians want a strong leader at the
helm of affairs, a film opens at the theatres that tells the story of a leader
who billed his insignificance as his biggest strength. That's why you should
consider watching

_An Insignificant Man_

\- a film made by people who are still in their 30s but one that debunks myths
that no battle can be won against a strong leader and a strong party and shows
a party without any resources can be a challenger to parties with all kinds of
resources.

The film is not just the journey of the Aam Aadmi Party as it emerged with
dreams of political change; it also chronicles the journey of those who wanted
to see this change up close. Khushboo Ranka and Vinay Shukla must have been 26
at the time. When the scope of the film started to broaden, Khushboo reached
out to students of Delhi University for help and trained them in camera and
sound. Before that, Khushboo worked with filmmaker Anand Gandhi on

_Ship Of Theseus_

. Young men and women, barely 21 or 22, shot a large part of this film. More
than 50 per cent of this team were girls. You could say that the age of the
people who were dreaming of changing politics was curiously in sync with the
age of people who had decided to document it.

Arvind Kejriwal may be the hero of the film, but Yogendra Yadav too emerges as
no less than one. Arvind Kejriwal and Yogendra Yadav both stress the politics
of transparency and collective decision-making, but when it comes to the
process of winning elections, both start clashing with their own principles.
Sure, both seem to fail for a while, but their intent to change politics
doesn't change - even though politics does end up changing them.

It's evident that in an effort to bring down 400 hours of footage to a one-
and-a-half hour film, a significant portion of history does not make it to the
version we see. The film has been edited so that often, you begin to see it
through the prism of Arvind Kejriwal and Yogendra Yadav's eventual clash -
this is what creates the thrill of watching it. The age of private channels
and social media first changed Delhi into a media-obsessed society. The anchor
started believing that they could change politics, but in this film you can
see how politics is changing the anchor. Often, the film will make you laugh.
You will laugh at the anchor, you will laugh at reporters, you will laugh at
media surveys and you will laugh at yourself.

_An Insignificant Man_ debunks myths that no battle can be won against a
strong leader.

Even today, for millions of people, politics remains a mystery. What is the
leader like behind closed doors? When NDTV produced its programmes on 24 hours
with leaders on the campaign trail, its biggest draw was the exposure of what
the leader is like in their home and at their dining table. This film doesn't
catch the leader at his home, but in the space where he is prepping himself
for politics. How Arvind Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwas laugh at each other while
preparing taglines for the media is a treat to watch. Within the film, they
are seen watching a movie together. I don't know if they will watch this one
together or not.

A film like this will not get made in India again because now perhaps even the
Aam Aadmi Party would not allow any filmmaker such access. Everyone's stake at
the political poker table has grown. Films like these are often produced
abroad but in India, audiences of every political section should watch it.
Supporters of Congress and BJP should watch it the most. How Kejriwal smashes
Sheila Dikshit as an insignificant man and the BJP's arrogance in dismissing
his organisational skills are big lessons.

The glowing hallmark of a democracy is often when someone insignificant
actually becomes the leader. This is why Narendra Modi in 2014 stresses
himself as a tea-seller though he was a three-term Chief Minister. Everyone
forgot that a Chief Minister was staking claim to be a Prime Minister and
started believing that a tea-seller was about to get the country's top job.
Don't mock the ordinary. Often, it is precisely what becomes extra-ordinary.
The film may seem to be about Kejriwal but it is in truth about the common man
that Kejriwal represents.

This film offers different perspectives. How politics picks its issues,
deliberates on them and how conveniently some of these are marginalised. You
will walk out of the theatre a better voter after watching all of this. This
film is not a historical document. That document was the one which was snipped
away on the editing table. You cannot understand the Anna movement without the
characters of Anna Hazare, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan and Baba Ramdev. But
this film makes it clear that its story is of the making of the Aam Aadmi
Party and its first big promotion to power.

**Moody's Upgrades India Rating After 13 Years Betting On PM Modi's Reforms, Markets Up** 

 ______ 
PM Modi has pushed through sweeping reforms

Moody's Investors Service raised India's sovereign rating for the first time
since 2004, overlooking a haze of short-term economic uncertainties to bet on
the nation's prospects from a raft of policy changes by Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.

The rupee, bonds and stocks rallied after the ratings firm upgraded India to
Baa2 from Baa3 and said reforms being pushed through by PM Modi's government
will help stabilize rising levels of debt. That's a one-level shift from the
lowest investment-grade ranking and puts India in line with the Philippines
and Italy.

""This is an overdue correction,"" PM Modi's Chief Economic Adviser Arvind
Subramanian told Bloomberg Quint, referring to the upgrade. ""This is a
recognition of India's macro economic reforms. But it has also to be kept in
mind that these are external factors. And the government will pursue its own
reform agenda. And those will drive our economic development.""

Some investors termed it a surprise given that India recently surrendered its
status as the world's fastest-growing major economy amid sweeping policy
change. The upgrade could prove to be a big win for ruling party BJP, which
has faced increasing attacks about the economic slowdown before key elections
in PM Modi's home state Gujarat next month.

""This is a positive surprise to the markets, especially in terms of timing,""
said Vivek Rajpal, a rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore.
""One fear that was developing in the market was debt-flow positioning.""

The rupee surged as much as 1 percent to 64.67 per dollar in Mumbai while the
yield on the 10-year sovereign bond tumbled 11 basis points to 6.96 percent
and the benchmark equity index rose 1.25 percent. Markets have welcomed the
move, with the Sensex rising over 400 points on Friday morning at 33,520 and
the Nifty gaining 120 points.

**Ease of Business**

PM Modi has pushed through sweeping reforms, with mixed results. Last year's
removal from circulation of almost 90 percent of the nation's currency weighed
on growth. Expansion in gross domestic product slipped below 6 percent in the
April-June quarter, sparking expectations that the government will need to
announce a fiscal stimulus package to boost activity.

Other measures -- such as efforts to cut red tape and the imposition of a new
consumption tax -- have met with mixed success. The government won praise from
ratings firms for a $32 billion program to recapitalize banks that economists
say will revive lending and stoke demand on the ground.

The World Bank has acknowledged it's getting easier to do business in India,
with Asia's third-largest economy jumping 30 places to rank 100th in the
latest ranking released last month. Earlier this week, Pew Research Center
said PM Modi remained a popular leader and public confidence in the economy
and the overall direction had improved.

**Debt Burden**

Moody's cited the goods and services tax, which it said will promote
productivity by removing barriers to interstate trade, improvements to the
monetary policy framework, measures to clean up non-performing loans, and
efforts to bring more areas into the formal economy.

""While India's high debt burden remains a constraint on the country's credit
profile, Moody's believes that the reforms put in place have reduced the risk
of a sharp increase in debt, even in potential downside scenarios,"" according
to the firm's release.

It noted most of the measures will take time for their impact to be felt,
while some -- such as GST and demonetization -- have undermined growth in the
near term. Moody's forecast GDP growth of 6.7 percent for the fiscal year
ended March 2018, with a pick up to 7.5 percent in the following year and
""similarly robust"" levels from 2019 onward.

Those are likely to help restore some investor confidence in Indian assets
after a big sell-off in the past few weeks.

Moody's is looking through the near-term political cycle ahead of state polls
when ""populism may overshadow reform momentum,"" according to Vishnu Varathan,
Singapore-based head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. The
afterglow from the upgrade won't last long given the emerging signs of
quickening inflation and a widening current account and fiscal deficit,
Varathan said.

**PM Modi reviews performance of key infrastructure sectors** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked officials to use resources “optimally throughout the year” to build roads and houses and explore new technologies for boosting coal output as part of his government’s initiative to push economic growth.

Modi on Thursday met top officials from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), policy thinktank National Institution for Transforming India or NITI Aayog, and various ministries as he reviewed the progress of key infrastructure sectors including road, housing, coal, and power.

The chief executive of the NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant said in a presentation that 81% of the targeted habitations or 145,000 have so far been connected under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

Officials also said that “progress is being made” towards connecting all the remaining unconnected habitations within a defined timeframe.

“The Prime Minister observed that the resources available for this work should be used optimally throughout the year. He also hoped that the advancement of the Union Budget date would lead to further improvement in performance,” the PMO said in a statement.

The statement added that the Prime Minister was informed of the “expeditious resolution” of complaints received on the Meri Sadak app and called for a detailed analysis of the complaints, “so that timely remedial measures are initiated wherever required”.

Government data shows that its agencies have attained highest ever average daily construction rate of 130km for rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. This has led to an addition of 47,400 km of PMGSY roads in 2016-17. About 11,641 additional habitations have been connected with roads in the same period.

Over 4,000 km of rural roads have been constructed using green technology in 2016-17. The use of non-conventional materials such as waste plastic, cold mix, geo-textiles, fly ash, iron and copper slag is being pushed aggressively.

The Prime Minister, who has promised to deliver 1 crore houses in the rural areas by 2019, said that the positive impact of housing on the lives of the beneficiaries should be suitably examined and the focus should be on improving their quality of life.

Modi also called for renewed efforts towards underground mining and coal gasification through the infusion of latest technology inputs.

The PMO said Modi was also informed about progress in meeting the targets for rural electrification and household electrification.

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only world statesman to have stood up to China's Belt and Road Initiative even though the US has been silent on the ambitious project till recently, a top American expert on China said today.During a Congressional hearing, Michael Pillsbury , Director of Center on Chinese Strategy at the prestigious think-tank Hudson Institute, told lawmakers that Modi and his team have been quite outspoken against Chinese President Xi Jinping 's ambitious project.""The only statesman in the world who stood up to it yet, is Prime Minister Modi. He and his team have been quite outspoken, partly because the Belt and Road Initiative includes violation of Indian sovereign claims,"" Pillsbury said.""But the US government, until now and this is a five- year-old initiative if you count the early part of it, has been silent,"" he said.Praising the Trump administration for its new Indo- Pacific strategy, the former Pentagon official said in recent days people have heard more than 50 times by members of the Trump administration including the president himself mentioning ""free and open"" Indo-Pacific region.""The Chinese have already attacked this. They don't like it,"" said Pillsbury, who is considered an authority on China- related issues.""The Indians, fairly recently, were joking about we want to make the Indian Ocean the Indian Ocean, by which they meant the purchase of several billion dollars worth of American PA aircraft, which have weapon systems in the back that can sink ships, frankly, and other improvements including maritime situational awareness and a big new center in Delhi where the Indians can keep track of both blue holes and grey holes going through the Indian Ocean,"" he said.""Chinese are very angry about this. They have criticised the Obama administration for its effort to, as they say, boost India, to a higher rank order in comprehensive power than the Chinese believe India deserves,"" the top American expert on China said in response to a question.Senator Ed Markey said China's signature Belt and Road Initiative that aims to position China as the uncontested leading power in Asia ""may further coerce"" its neighbours through loans they cannot repay.The BRI aimed at building a vast network of infrastructure projects expanding China's expertise and capital to different parts of the world includes USD 50 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) over which India has protested as it traversed through Pakistan- occupied-Kashmir (PoK).India boycotted the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) organised by China in May this year to highlight its concerns over Beijing pushing projects through the the PoK.He said the US companies face the threat of intellectual property theft with reports that China has been stealing cutting-edge research as well as sensitive trade secrets from the US.And that includes companies working in the clean energy sector who cannot compete with state-backed firms, he alleged.Pillsbury said Chinese are offering low interest loans to countries that cannot afford it.""We're already saw the example of Sri Lanka, which fell behind in its payments and then was the subject of coercion that if you transfer the main port here in Sri Lanka to Chinese control, we will forgive the debt. The Sri Lankans did it,"" he said.There were concerns of debt burden brought in by the BRI projects after Sri Lanka opted for long-term lease of its Hambantota port for USD 1.12 billion debt swap.""...So we are beginning to see, just through the media, what the Belt and Road Initiative may mean,"" Pillsbury told the lawmakers.Senator Markey said China is challenging the very underpinnings of the global order that has brought peace and prosperity.China has not lived up to its international obligations to help denuclearise the Korean Peninsula, he said.""No country has greater leverage than China, which is responsible for approximately 90 per cent of North Korean trade,"" he noted.Markey said, ""China is challenging the international system elsewhere as well. It has constructed in violation of international law, military bases on artificial islands and disputed areas of the South China Sea.""""Through economic coercion, Beijing undermined the sovereignty of its smaller neighbours and countries including South Korea and the Philippines face Chinese retaliation for taking legal and sovereign actions in their own defence,"" he said.

**Another video with communal overtones surfaces in poll-bound Gujarat, lawyer goes to EC, police**

Ahead of Gujarat elections, amid the numerous controversial videos floating on social media, another video with communal overtones has surfaced. (Picture for representational purpose) Ahead of Gujarat elections, amid the numerous controversial videos floating on social media, another video with communal overtones has surfaced. (Picture for representational purpose)

Ahead of Gujarat elections, amid the numerous controversial videos floating on social media, another video with communal overtones has surfaced. A human rights advocate from Ahmedabad has written to the Election Commission to stop its circulation, claiming the video can be misused to polarise voting and invoke hatred against ‘Muslims’ in the state.’

In the video, a young girl is shown walking hurriedly on a public road as a sound similar to azan, the Muslim call for prayer or namaz, is heard in the background. At the same time, a couple, supposedly the parents of the girl, are shown waiting anxiously in their house.

The 1.15-minute long video, in Gujarati language, flashes this statement — ‘Gujarat ma sanjhe 7 pachhi avu thai shake chhe. (This can happen in Gujarat after 7 in the evening)’ — right in the beginning.

An idol of Lord Krishna is also shown in the background of the girl’s house. As soon as the girl reaches home, her mother hugs her while her father pats her on head. After this, the girl’s mother faces the camera and says, “Ek minute, kem navai lagi ne ke aa Gujarat ni vaat chhe? (One minute, are you surprised to see if this is Gujarat?)”

The girl’s father says: “Bavis varsh pehla pan avu j thatu hatu. Ane avu thai shake chhe. Jo e loko avshe to. (Twenty two years back, this used to happen. And it can happen, if those people come to power.)”

Girl now says, “Pan don’t worry. Koi nai ave. Kemke ahi Modi chhe. (But, don’t worry. Nobody will come. Because, Modi is there.)”

The video concludes with these Gujarati words in saffron colour: ‘Apno Vote, Apni Suraksha (Our Vote, Our Security).’

The lawyer, who has lodged the complaint with the Election Commission and Ahmedabad City, has been identified as Govind Parmar from Human Rights Law Network.

“It is clear that the intention of the video is to spread a feeling of fear among majority community members from Muslims and that it has been made to spread hatred towards Muslims and for polarisation of votes which is an offence,” Pamar has stated in his complaint with a demand to stop circulation of the video immediately and to take legal action against the persons shown in the video and the ones who have made it.

Speaking with The Indian Express, Parmar said, “I have sent my complaint to the Election Commission and to the Crime Branch through RPAD (Registered Post Acknowledgment Due). I have also sent it through an email to the Election Commission.”

When contacted, Additional Chief Electoral Officer L P Padaliya said, “(So far) We have not got any complaint in this matter.”

Amid all this, the IT Cell of Gujarat Congress has launched a campaign called ‘Gujarat ne Daravsho Nahi (Don’t frighten Gujarat.)’ on social media.

Head of Gujarat Congress’s IT Cell Rohan Gupta says, “We have launched this trend on social media as there are videos coming up that try to instill fear among the public, specially women, (against Congress party.) We are not naming any party responsible for this (video), but I personally think that this could be the surrogate campaign of BJP as the only party that can benefit by it is BJP.”

Pankaj Shukla of Gujarat BJP’s Social Media Cell, however, denies BJP having any role in it. “We do not know, if who has made the video. We have not done it. But, there are so many well-wishers of BJP party who must have turned their feelings into the video.”

Next big move by Modi? Bank cheque facility may be withdrawn to push digital transactions, says CAIT official

A senior functionary of industry body CAIT today said the Centre may withdraw the bank cheque book facility in the ""near future"" to encourage digital transactions.

A senior functionary of industry body CAIT today said the Centre may withdraw the bank cheque book facility in the “near future” to encourage digital transactions. Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said the government needs to encourage use of debit and credit cards. “In all probability, the Centre may withdraw the cheque book facility in the near future to encourage digital transactions,” he said. Khandelwal was talking to reporters at the launch of ‘Digital Rath’, a joint initiative of the CAIT and Mastercard to encourage traders to adopt different modes of digital transactions and promote cashless economy. The CAIT secretary general said, “The government spends Rs 25,000 crore on printing of currency notes and another Rs 6,000 crore on their security and logistics. “Moreover, banks charge 1 per cent on payments through debit card and 2 per cent through credit cards. The government needs to incentivise this process by providing subsidy directly to the banks so these charges can be waived.”

Khandelwal said only 5 per cent of the total 80-crore ATM-cum-debit cards are used for cashless transactions, while 95 per cent of them are used for cash withdrawals. Mastercard Executive Director (Global Community Relations) Ravi Aurora said this initiative with the CAIT will provide a “major fillip in our endeavour to move towards a less-cash society”. “Under the digital literacy campaign, we have held about 450 conferences during the past three years. By the end of next month, we have set the target to reach to 10 lakh merchants to support the government’s target of powering 2,500 -crore digital transactions,” Aurora said.

Aurora said ‘Digital Rath’ would further strengthen the nationwide movement of ‘Cashless Bano India” in line with the government’s vision of digital India. “We believe small traders and merchants are an important constituency to help India transform into a knowledge economy.” He said Mastercard has invested about USD 500 million in India during the past couple of years and it plans to pump in another USD 700-800 million. CAIT president B C Bhartia said a sizeable part of the Indian population consists of youths. “Youths prefer digital transactions. Even temples have put up machines for digital transactions. Now, the government needs to make digital transactions more attractive,” he added.

**PM Modi Only World Statesman To Stand Up To China: Top US Expert** 

 ______ 
**Washington: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only world statesman to have stood up to
China and their Belt and Road Initiative, even though the US has been silent
on the ambitious project till recently, a top American expert on China said
today.

During a Congressional hearing, Michael Pillsbury, Director of Center on
Chinese Strategy at the prestigious think-tank Hudson Institute, told
lawmakers that PM Modi and his team have been quite outspoken against Chinese
President Xi Jinping's ambitious project.

""The only statesman in the world who stood up to it yet, is Prime Minister
Modi. He and his team have been quite outspoken, partly because the Belt and
Road Initiative includes violation of Indian sovereign claims,"" Mr Pillsbury
said.

""But the US government, until now and this is a five-year-old initiative if
you count the early part of it, has been silent,"" he said.

Praising the Trump administration for its new Indo-Pacific strategy, the
former Pentagon official said in recent days people have heard more than 50
times by members of the Trump administration including the president himself
mentioning a ""free and open"" Indo-Pacific region.

""The Chinese have already attacked this. They don't like it,"" said Mr
Pillsbury, who is considered an authority on China-related issues.

""The Indians, fairly recently, were joking about we want to make the Indian
Ocean the Indian Ocean, by which they meant the purchase of several billion
dollars worth of American PA aircraft, which have weapon systems in the back
that can sink ships, frankly, and other improvements including maritime
situational awareness and a big new center in Delhi where the Indians can keep
track of both blue holes and grey holes going through the Indian Ocean,"" he
said.

""The Chinese are very angry about this. They have criticised the Obama
administration for its effort to, as they say, boost India, to a higher rank
order in comprehensive power than the Chinese believe India deserves,"" the top
American expert on China said in response to a question.

Senator Ed Markey said China's signature Belt and Road Initiative that aims to
position China as the uncontested leading power in Asia ""may further coerce""
and bully its neighbours through loans they cannot repay.

The Belt and Road Initiative aimed at building a vast network of
infrastructure projects expanding China's expertise and capital to different
parts of the world includes $50 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor or
CPEC over which India has protested as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-
Kashmir or PoK.

India boycotted the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) organised by China in May this
year to highlight its concerns over Beijing trying to push projects through
PoK.

Speaking about alleged theft by China, he said the US companies face the
threat of intellectual property theft with reports that China has been
stealing cutting-edge research as well as sensitive trade secrets from the
United States. And that includes companies working in the clean energy sector
who cannot compete with state-backed firms.

Mr Pillsbury also said the Chinese are offering low interest loans to
countries that cannot afford it. ""We're already saw the example of Sri Lanka,
which fell behind in its payments and then was the subject of coercion that if
you transfer the main port here in Sri Lanka to Chinese control, we will
forgive the debt. The Sri Lankans did it,"" he said.

There were serious concerns of debt burden brought in by the Belt and Road
Initiative projects after Sri Lanka opted for long-term lease of its
Hambantota port for a $1.12 billion debt swap. ""...So we are beginning to see
what the Belt and Road Initiative may mean,"" Mr Pillsbury told the lawmakers.

Senator Markey said China is challenging the very underpinnings of the global
order that has brought peace and prosperity. China has not lived up to its
international obligations to help de-nuclearise the Korean Peninsula, he said.

""No country has greater leverage than China, which is responsible for
approximately 90 per cent of North Korean trade,"" he noted.

Mr Markey said, ""China is challenging the international system elsewhere as
well. It has constructed in violation of international law, military bases on
artificial islands and disputed areas of the South China Sea.""

""Through economic coercion, Beijing undermined the sovereignty of its smaller
neighbours and countries including South Korea and the Philippines face
Chinese retaliation for taking legal and sovereign actions in their own
defence,"" he said.

And no offence to anyone but let's not kid ourselves, most in this sub are the upper 10% who have no exposure to rural India other than the maid, driver or street hawker being from a rural area.

445,"&gt; India is a rapidly developing economy with numerous developmental needs. A major component of India’s developmental plan is the upgradation of current rail networks as well as the development of new high speed rail corridors popularly known as bullet trains. The Mumbai – Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project, is a visionary project by the NDA Government which will herald a new era of safety, speed and service for the people, and help Indian Railways become an international leader in scale, speed and skill.
&gt; 
&gt; New technology has not always been adopted easily, and has at most times seen resistance. However, history shows us that new technology and advancements are highly beneficial for the country. For example, we see that naysayers had also criticised the start of the Rajdhani Trains in 1968. Even the chairman of the railway board opposed it; such things keep India backward. But today, they are the trains that everyone wishes to travel in.
&gt; 
&gt; Another example of when people thought India was not ready for new technology was when the mobile phone was introduced into the market. At the time it was considered to be elitist and expensive with a phone call costing Rs. 16 per min. But today India has the 2nd largest market for mobile phones in the world with almost every Indian owning a mobile.
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, the Bullet Train project will also help Indian Railways revolutionise every passenger’s journey. Here’s how this project will help the nation and Railways grow in many ways:
&gt; 
&gt; A Low Cost Project
&gt; 
&gt; The bullet train project not only adds to the rail networks in terms of transport capabilities but also adds to the growth capabilities of the country. Here’s how:
&gt; 
&gt; The project is funded by a loan on terms which tantamount to a grant
&gt; The Ministry of Railways has been given Rs. 88,000 crores as a soft loan from the Japanese government which will help Railways to kick off the process.
&gt; The minuscule interest rate of 0.1% and the repayment time of 50 years is economically advantageous to our economy.
&gt; As the repayment of loan is to begin after 15 years of receiving the loan
&gt; It is not compromising on funds from safety since, this money for the bullet train is coming from Japan. I have already addressed the steps we are taking to improve safety in an earlier quora post.
&gt; 
&gt; Promoting Make In India Vision
&gt; 
&gt; As per the agreement, the project has ‘Make in India’ &amp; ‘Transfer of technology’ objectives. This is how it will add fuel to the Government’s ‘Make In India’ mission:
&gt; 
&gt; The Make in India objective will ensure that most of the amount invested in this project would be spent and utilized within India
&gt; Working With A Cutting Edge Technology
&gt; 
&gt; Active interactions are already taking place between the industries of India and Japan. The country is getting a cutting-edge technology for the high-speed train project. Here’s how the 50 years old Shinkansen Technology by Japan will uplift the project:
&gt; 
&gt; The train delay record of Shinkansen is less than a minute with zero fatality
&gt; The project is set to provide reliable and comfortable service with high standards of safety
&gt; Technology regarding disaster predictions and preventions will also be acquired
&gt; New technologies in ballast-less tracks, under sea tunnels etc. will be developed, and we will work towards proliferating these across Railways
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, with the presence and availability of this technology, India will leapfrog to the cutting edge of latest train developments with passengers able to reach their destination in 2 hours as against the current 7-8 hours by train.
&gt; 
&gt; Helping India’s Economic Growth
&gt; 
&gt; The Bullet Train project will also help the nation boost its economic growth by:
&gt; 
&gt; Manufacturing in India, will give a boost to job creation and exporting to the world
&gt; Total 12 stations, 4 stations in Maharashtra &amp; 8 in Gujarat, will emerge as economic powerhouses powered by easy travel
&gt; Long run costs are also expected to fall through the advantages gained by economies of scale further developing our network
&gt; Creating More Jobs
&gt; 
&gt; Hon’ble PM Narendra Modi rightly stated that the prestigious bullet train will be a game-changer for the nation, besides being ‘a symbol of New India’ that his government seeks to build by 2022. Here’s how this project will be a major driver in job creations:
&gt; 
&gt; It will create employment opportunities both in the Short Run and Medium Run and generate employment for about 20,000 workers during the construction phase
&gt; High Speed Rail Training Institute being developed at Vadodara would train 4000 workers resulting in standards that are on par with Japan
&gt; 300 young officials of Indian Railways are being trained in Japan to give them exposure in High Speed Track Technology
&gt; It will create a highly skilled and capable work force in the long run
&gt; The development of the New Shinkansen Technology by Japan will ensure more growth opportunities
&gt; 
&gt; Some other salient features of this project are as follow:
&gt; 
&gt; The art of cleaning trains in approx. 7 minutes will also help in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
&gt; C02 per km travelled by the train is ~ ¼ th of an aeroplane and below ⅓ rd of a car will ensure environment efficiency
&gt; 
&gt; The bullet train project will not only add to the rail networks in terms of transport capabilities but will also add to the growth capabilities of the country.",2017-11-18 01:03:55

It was still way behind the half way mark of 145 seats in the 288-seat assembly. Clearly, the BJP is now ‘supposedly set to win’ 260 seats there, according to Pew’s imaginary survey.

Elections are with multiple parties but such comparison is generally done with previous govts.

**Next: 1 billion UIDs, accounts and mobiles?** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Seeing the Moody's upgrade, preceded by a 30-spot jump in 'ease of business' rankings, as an endorsement of major initiatives like demonetisation , GST and Aadhaar, the government is set to pursue an unique and ambitious "" 1 billion-1 billion-1 billion "" connectivity vision.This means one billion unique Aadhaar numbers, linked to one billion bank accounts and one billion mobiles. The target follows the success of demonetisation in bringing about a substantial Rs 6 lakh crore reduction in value of high value notes that would have been in circulation and a rising trend of bank accounts and digital payments, said official sources.There is confidence in government circles that the ""1 plus 1 plus 1"" figure will happen soon - though no target dates are spelt out - and this will mark a big step towards expanding the financial and digital mainstream.According to official statistics, estimated high value notes at the end of September, 2017, add up to approximately Rs 12 lakh crore as against a value of Rs 15.44 crore in November, 2016 when PM Narendra Modi announced demonetisation. ""The number has more or less stabilised now,"" said a source.The rate at which specified bank notes were growing meant they would have been of the order of around Rs 18 lakh crore and they have been effectively brought down by Rs 6 lakh crore. ""There is no shortage of currency of high value or other notes. This reduction eliminates the potential to store this amount as black money,"" said a source.The Modi government finds positive references to politically contested measures like demonetisation, GST and Aadhaar as particularly gratifying as it has waged a bitter battle over these programmes with its policy critics and the opposition. The improved rating, which was shared with the government a day before release, sees these steps as serious attempts to formalise the economy and make it more transparent.The government has sought to counter attacks that the return of 99% of denotified currency, despite being contrary to what was initially anticipated, does not signal a failure of demonetisation.If this was the only objective, said sources, the government would not have offered several windows to exchange old notes. The sharp reduction in the number of high-value notes is seen as a significant step towards a less cash economy promised by the government and, coupled with measures such as limits on such payments for property purchases, is expected to accelerate the process.Despite criticism against the rollout of GST, the tax reform has received widespread approval even from economists who were doubtful of note ban. The fillip to digitalisation , read in conjunction with Aadhaar and measures like BHIM-UPI, is also being recognised by ratings agencies, and the reduced transaction costs are also making a difference, said sources.The UID schemes and its linkage with welfare payments as well as PAN cards and other use by private firms have been criticised for exclusion as well as intrusion of privacy. The thumbs up to UID as a means of quickly establishing identity of a beneficiary or payment maker is a shot in the arm for the government.

Which photo is this and no it's not like school uniforms are very very costly. I can find you quite some people who were poor and had uniforms back in the day in any small town or big villages. Most of them were also donated too. Considering his father was close to RSS , it's highly possible that he simply got some donations. Nothing that actually proves anything.

**Moody’s India ratings upgrade: Congress, CPM not happy, ask if poor should eat these numbers** 

 ______ 
Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Friday downplayed US-based Moody’s upgrade to India’s sovereign credit rating.

Opposition leaders from Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Friday downplayed US-based Moody’s upgrade to India’s sovereign credit rating. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that PM Narendra Modi and Moody’s failed to gauge the ‘Mood of the Nation’. “Modiji &amp; Moodys ‘जोड़ी’ have failed to gauge the ‘Mood of the Nation’. Hunger Deaths, Farmer’s shootings, Agri Distress, Job Losses, Lowest Credit Ratings, Rising Prices, Plunging Exports, Flawed GST, Demonetisation Disaster, Stagnant Growth are the real indices to measure it, (sic)” Surjewala said.

He further accused Centre of making desperate attempts to claim its lost crediblity. “After destroying India’s economy, Modi Govt is clutching at straws to claim lost credibility. They rely upon a World Bank report of Delhi/Mumbai to claim all is well &amp; quote a PEW survey of 2464 people to claim victory. At this pace, Modiji should be fighting next election abroad, (sic)” Surjewala added.

On the other hand, CPI (M) chief Sitaram Yechury said Modi government wants to people to eat ratings. “All indices of real lives of Indians: Jobs, Growth: are down. Rural distress, Malnutrition, gender gap and hunger is worsening,” Yechury wrote on Twitter. “Inequality of Wealth is up in 3 years sharply. 1% own over 58% of Indian wealth. Who is this govt fooling?” he added. “Modi govt wants the poor, the hungry, protesting farmers, jobless and those hit by the Economy crumbling, to eat these ‘ratings’? They can keep raising a toast to themselves. This only taunts and mocks those suffering the hopelessness brought in by BJP’s Jumlanomics,” said the CPI(M) chief.

Earlier, US-based Moody’s upgraded India’s sovereign credit rating by a notch to ‘Baa2’ with a stable outlook citing improved growth prospects driven by economic and institutional reforms.

The rating upgrade, which came after a gap of 13 years, was hailed by ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Earlier, India was a part of ‘Baa3’ rating, which was the lowest investment grade just a notch above ‘junk’ status.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley termed the upgrade of India’s credit rating by Moody’s after a gap of 13 years as a “belated recognition” of reforms in the last few years. Jaitley vowed to continue them while maintaining fiscal discipline. He said that upgradation is a recognition that India continues to follow the path of fiscal prudence which has brought stability to the economy.

“It is an upgrade which has happened after 13 years. We welcome it and believe that it is a belated recognition of all the positive steps taken in India in the last few years which have contributed to the strengthening of the Indian economy,” he told reporters. “The decision to upgrade the ratings is underpinned by Moody’s expectation that continued progress on economic and institutional reforms will, over time, enhance India’s high growth potential and its large and stable financing base for government debt and will likely contribute to a gradual decline in the general government debt burden over the medium term,” Moody’s said in a statement.

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only world statesman to have stood up toeven though the US has been silent on the ambitious project till recently, a top American expert on China said.During a Congressional hearing, Michael Pillsbury, Director of Center on Chinese Strategy at the prestigious think-tank Hudson Institute, told lawmakers that Modi and his team have been quite outspoken against Chinese President Xi Jinping 's ambitious project.""The only statesman in the world who stood up to it yet, is Prime Minister Modi. He and his team have been quite outspoken, partly because the Belt and Road Initiative includes violation of Indian sovereign claims,"" Pillsbury said.""But the US government, until now and this is a five-year-old initiative if you count the early part of it, has been silent,"" he said.Praising the Trump administration for its new Indo-Pacific strategy, the former Pentagon official said in recent days, people have heard more than 50 times by members of the Trump administration including the president himself mentioning a ""free and open"" Indo-Pacific region.""The Chinese have already attacked this. They don't like it,"" said Pillsbury, who is considered an authority on China-related issues.""The Indians, fairly recently, were joking about we want to make the Indian Ocean the Indian Ocean, by which they meant the purchase of several billion dollars worth of American PA aircraft, which have weapon systems in the back that can sink ships, frankly, and other improvements including maritime situational awareness and a big new center in Delhi where the Indians can keep track of both blue holes and grey holes going through the Indian Ocean,"" he said.""The Chinese are very angry about this. They have criticised the Obama administration for its effort to, as they say, boost India, to a higher rank order in comprehensive power than the Chinese believe India deserves,"" the top American expert on China said in response to a question.Senator Ed Markey said China's signature Belt and Road Initiative that aims to position China as the uncontested leading power in Asia ""may further coerce"" its neighbours through loans they cannot repay.The BRI aimed at building a vast network of infrastructure projects expanding China's expertise and capital to different parts of the world includes USD 50 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) over which India has protested as it traversed through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK).(BRF) organised by China in May this year to highlight its concerns over Beijing pushing projects through the the PoK.He said the US companies face the threat of intellectual property theft with reports that China has been stealing cutting-edge research as well as sensitive trade secrets from the US.And that includes companies working in the clean energy sector who cannot compete with state-backed firms, he alleged.Pillsbury said Chinese are offering low interest loans to countries that cannot afford it.""We're already saw the example of Sri Lanka, which fell behind in its payments and then was the subject of coercion that if you transfer the main port here in Sri Lanka to Chinese control, we will forgive the debt. The Sri Lankans did it,"" he said.There were concerns of debt burden brought in by the BRI projects after Sri Lanka opted for long-term lease of its Hambantota port for USD 1.12 billion debt swap.""...So we are beginning to see, just through the media, what the Belt and Road Initiative may mean,"" Pillsbury told the lawmakers.Senator Markey said China is challenging the very underpinnings of the global order that has brought peace and prosperity.China has not lived up to its international obligations to help denuclearise the Korean Peninsula, he said.""No country has greater leverage than China, which is responsible for approximately 90 per cent of North Korean trade,"" he noted.Markey said, ""China is challenging the international system elsewhere as well. It has constructed in violation of international law, military bases on artificial islands and disputed areas of the South China Sea.""""Through economic coercion, Beijing undermined the sovereignty of its smaller neighbours and countries including South Korea and the Philippines face Chinese retaliation for taking legal and sovereign actions in their own defence,"" he said.

**Comrades mistook Tom Moody for Moody's, shower criticism on cricketer's FB page** 

 ______ 
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The cyber warriors of the CPM in Kerala turned out to be laughing stocks after they mistook Australian cricketer Tom Moody for the international credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service.Immediately after news broke out regarding the improved credit rating Moody's has accorded to India, hard-core CPM activists hell bent on promoting the party ideology have started showering criticism against the cricketer on his Facebook page wall.The comrades, most of them in their prime youth bluntly told Tom Moody that he should be ashamed of himself for giving an improved rating to the Indian economy under the Modi government. Some of them even dared Moody to visit Kerala.While one Comrade said Moody would fail in his mission as even Israel's secret agency Mosad could not inflict even a minor injury to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan . However, there were some other comments which tried to expose the communists, but such seemingly mild criticism failed to deter the comrades from understanding their blunder attack against Tom Moody.According to one comment, Moody gave such positive report after taking commission from Modi. Some Malayali Facebook users who understood the drama were also seen tendering apology to Tom Moody for the bizarre criticism against him. Apparently, it was only on October 4 that Moody had his last post, saying thanks for all those wished him birthday wishes.

New Delhi/Mumbai: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s wriggle room to relax his deficit targets just got reduced by Moody’s Investors Service.

On Thursday, the government was talking about easing its budget goals as sweeping policy changes hurt growth and revenue. Then, early Friday, Moody’s upgraded India’s sovereign rating to the highest since 1988, prompting a U-turn from the administration.

“We’ll continue to maintain the glide path,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said at a briefing in New Delhi on Friday, referring to his plan to shrink the budget shortfall to 3.2% of GDP in the year through March 2018 and a decade-low of 3% the next year. “The upgrade is a recognition of the fact that India continues to follow a path of fiscal prudence.”

Jaitley’s words contrast with his comments to investors in Singapore on Thursday, when he said “challenges arising from structural reforms could change the glide path.” He can’t afford to follow through on that now because Moody’s one-notch rating upgrade is a bet that India will contain public debt.

Both S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings rate India at BBB-, a notch above junk status. S&amp;P’s highest ever rating for India stood at BBB in 1990 from which it was downgraded in March 1991. Fitch Ratings’ current rating stands as its highest ever.

While rating companies have lost some of their allure abroad after they failed to predict the financial crisis of 2008, they’re still considered a stamp of credibility in emerging markets, where local statistics can often be dodgy.

Modi needs such a boost: he faces elections in his home state of Gujarat next month, where polls point to the closest contest in years. Voters are concerned about a lack of jobs and higher inflation after Modi’s decision last year to invalidate almost 90% of currency in circulation and the disruptive roll out of a consumption tax this July. Moreover, India’s financial assets have seen a sell-off over the past weeks.

“The government will likely remain on the path of fiscal consolidation as it is mindful of maintaining investor confidence,” said Dhawal Dalal, chief investment officer for debt at Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd. “There has been significant increase in positivity generated among foreign investors as they have appreciated fiscal policy and various measures taken by the present government in order to improve economic growth.”

The rupee strengthened as much as 1% in Mumbai on Friday, the most since mid-March, while the main equity index rallied 0.7%. The yield on 10-year sovereign bonds, which slipped from a 14-month high to 7.05%, could fall to 6.95% by March, according to Yes Bank Ltd. It predicts the currency may strengthen further if Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings follow Moody’s in upgrading India.

Currency and bond markets have come under pressure in recent weeks due to rising crude oil prices and talk of potential fiscal slippage.

“The timing is a surprise given concerns regarding the fiscal metrics right now,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong of Moody’s move.

More cautious

“S&amp;P and Fitch are more cautious and will not follow suit soon,” said Anthony Chan, an Asian sovereign strategist at AllianceBernstein Holding Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The upgrade cited reform progress, especially GST, but GST’s tax dilution was a disappointment and caused many to forecast bigger fiscal slippage.”

Chan was referring to Jaitley’s decision last week to slash tax rates on more than 200 goods and services. The move will cost Rs20,000 crore ($3 billion) in lost revenue. It is seen as a step to curb prices that are rising at the fastest pace in seven months and an attempt to encourage companies to invest and hire more, ultimately soothing voters.

Growth in gross domestic product slipped to a three-year low in the April-June quarter, muddying the near-term outlook, though the GST is expected to boost productivity in the longer term. Moody’s predicts annual expansion will slow to 6.7% in the year through March 2018 — from 7.1% — but rebound to 7.5 next year.

“The space for expenditure contraction is much less than other years,” said Pronab Sen, country director at New Delhi-based International Growth Centre and India’s former chief statistician. “There will be pressure when it comes to meeting the fiscal deficit target.” Bloomberg

**Chidambaram mocks at Narendra Modi government’s sudden love for Moody’s**

Mumbai: Mocking at government’s elation over the sovereign rating upgrade by Moody’s, ex-finance minister P. Chidambaram said only a few months ago the regime had flayed the rating methodology.

“Just some months ago, government had said the Moody’s methodology was all wrong... A long letter was written by Shaktikanta Das (ex-economic affairs secretary) questioning Moody’s ratings methodology, saying they’ve to revise their methodology as it’s all wonky,” he told the Tata Literature Live in Mumbai on Saturday.

Moody’s had on Friday upgraded the sovereign ratings by a notch to Baa2 with stable outlook, citing the Modi government’s various reform programme and higher growth prospectus. The last rating upgrade was in 2004.

Ridiculing the way government has reacted to the upward rating revision, the senior Congress leader recalled that for the government “Moody’s, whose methodology was all wrong circa 2016”. On higher growth, which was cited by the agency as one of the key reasons for the rating action, he said the same agency and government project growth at 6.7% for the current financial year.

“It was 8% in 2015-16, 7.1% in 2016-17 and will be 6.7% in 2017-18. Is that north or south, you conclude,” he said. According to him, there are three key indicators — gross fixed capital formation and within that private sector investment; credit growth, especially for small businesses, and jobs — which are critical to assess the health of an economy.

“But the dashboard is flashing red on all these three indicators,” he lamented. Reeling out numbers, Chidambaram said gross fixed capital formation is down 7-8 points from its peak and there’s no sign of it recovering in the near future as well. Further, he said private investment is at its lowest in the past seven-eight years.

In addition, several projects are stalled on one hand and may companies are on the other being referred to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. All these would lead to closures and downsizing and loss of jobs. Secondly, the former finance minister pointed out that credit growth has been the lowest in two decades.

“It has crept up 6% year-on-year, but for medium industries it has been negative credit growth...SMEs are struggling and have to find finances outside the formal lending system.” He also referred to the criticality of job creation saying, “government is unwilling to come up with reliable and authentic data...CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy), which is a quite credible agency, stated that between January and June 2017, as many as 19,60,000 jobs were lost.”

The senior Congress leader also said over 90% of jobs are in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector which requires an urgent push to boost the economy.
