That priest is not extreme, but RSS in Kerala accuses him of conversion. He has his own church and loyal followers. Understandable some people got pissed. In fact, some who expected instant Hindu Rashtra are super angry, and some who expected instant development are angry too.

Now to the rest:

&gt; These are additional supplementary battles to ~~support the larger war~~ to win next election.

Both, I think. Modi and BJP, the next election above all. RSS, the larger cultural war. 

Pre Elections, the deal between Bhagwat and Modi was, Hindu Rashtra will come but for that, Modi has to rule for 10-15 years. (This is from multiple journalists close to the RSS). So leave him be, let him do it his way. Post Elections, that changed. RSS became impatient (or parts of RSS did) and they have started their larger cultural war for the soul of the nation (At the moment, BJP is cool with it due to achche din not happening fast enough).",2016-03-22 00:26:23

---

&gt;* Kanhaiya Kumar, the student who was arrested on sedition charges, is scheduled to arrive tomorrow at the Hyderabad university where Dalit student Rohith Vemula killed himself after alleging caste discrimination.Mr Kumar, 28, will meet students who say that Mr Vemula was driven to suicide by university officials who suspended him and his friends in December, a month before the 26-year-old hanged himself in his hostel.University officials say Mr Kumar's meeting with students, which is likely to include a speech, has not been sanctioned.

&gt;* The meeting is to be held on the part of campus where students have set up a makeshift memorial for Mr Vemula.

&gt;* The police should be deployed to ensure the meeting happens,'' said Prashant, a close friend of Mr Vemula, to NDTV.Adding to the tension on campus is the return to office of Appa Rao, the Vice Chancellor of the university, who had gone on leave in the midst of the furious protests that followed Mr Vemula's suicide.Mr Vemula's suicide note said he did not blame anyone for his death, but a month before that, a despairing letter sent by him to the Vice Chancellor said Dalit students should be given a rope to hang themselves at the campus.Mr Vemula's death has been blamed by his family, a section of students, and the opposition on the vice-chancellors, union minister Bandarau Dattatreya and Union Education Minister Smriti Irani, who have been accused of hounding Mr Vemula and his friends based on a complaint filed by student leaders affiliated to the BJP who study at the same university.

&gt;* The government has denied that Mr Vemula and others were persecuted as a result.Weeks after the tragic ending to Mr Vemula's life, the government enlisted another massive controversy involving students when Mr Kumar was arrested from Delhi's famous Jawaharlal Nehru University or JNU on charges of making anti-national remarks.

&gt;* Video evidence of that speech, cited by the police, turned out to be doctored.Mr Kumar, who is on bail, has established himself since as a gripping orator whose speeches pledge a movement against what he describes as the divisive policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government.

&gt;* The shift to link the programs with market rates is testing Modis resolve as he seeks to kickstart growth that remains shaky despite outpacing other major economies.

&gt;* A backlash already prompted him to backtrack on a budget proposal to tax the provident funds of 37 million employees, a sign of his reluctance to stick with difficult political decisions ahead of a slew of state elections.

&gt;* Modi has struggled to fend off opposition attacks that his government favors the rich over the poor, a narrative that prompted him to drop efforts to make it easier to acquire land.

&gt;* Still, the cuts to small savings rates -- by as much as 130 basis points -- reflect the tensions over his broader goals to revive investment while keeping inflation under control in anation where the majority of the population lacks social security and lives on a few dollars per day.

---

&gt;* Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Prime Minister Narendra Modis popularity among the relatively well-off ahead of a series of state elections.

&gt;* Price increases for services deemed a luxury for most Indians could also complicate the central banks plans to cut borrowing costs, with decades of low investment in schools and hospitals meaning they will remain expensive for some time.

&gt;* Owners of motorcycles and cars are further upset that the government took away some windfall gains from falling oil prices in the form of taxes, and people across the country are cutting back on discretionary spending as expenses outstrip earnings.

&gt;* A disgruntled middle class also poses problems for Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan, who has pledged to bring down consumer price inflation to 5% by March, 2017 and 4% in the medium term.

&gt;* The spare capacity in the economy is not getting reflected in the core inflation number, which means the challenge for monetary policy to control the demand side pressure is much more, said one senior policymaker, hinting at the difficulty of deep rate cuts beyond April.

38,"I have been following the elections and I know exactly what Trump says. Looking at it as ""what Trump says in rallies"" versus ""what Modi says"" is completely meaningless because you could build similar cases in favor of Putin, Xi Jinping, Erdogan, Milosevic or if you don't want to consider ""nasty"" international figures just consider indian politicians who don't really say much but represent something dangerous - jyoti basu for example. You could even look at leaders like Rajiv Gandhi (under whom the Sikh riots happened), Indira Gandhi (who was almost a dictator at one point) and criminal thugs in power in multiple states who rule like dictators or monarchs - People like mamata, Lalu yadav, mulayam, shiv raj singh chauhan.

You mention violence at rallies - do you stop to think about political violence in India where people are regularly murdered? Or is the USA held to a different set of standards? Encounter killings in WB by communists ? Encounter killings by sangh affiliated groups?

Don't just look at Modi the person, look at the current state of indian politics and what is acceptable to the majority, and even the hardline fringe.

If you're going to define America by its most vocal Trump supporters you should be looking at sangh fanatics in India.

Being less PC doesn't mean he's literally Hitler. Are our politicians PC ? Is our society PC? marital rape is not part of criminal law , being gay is illegal and Africans or North East Indians regularly get violently discriminated and even lynched ? is the indian caste system PC?

Trump is going to be part of a democracy that largely works and have innumerable checks and balances and American society keeping him in check.

Modi doesn't have to say even a single world and could be the nicest person in the world, but the state of the Sangh parivar that many of his hardline fans vehemently support, and the state of indian society make it completely absurd for Indians to take the moral high ground. 2nd hand american leftist hysteria and paranoia, desi denialism, general ignorance about the world and India and crazy double standards every time this topic comes up.

39,"&gt; Hotasar, a small village of about 200 people in the Rajasthani desert, is very difficult to reach. In April last year, it was one of 18,452 Indian villages without electricity. In the past few months, that number has fallen to 12,100 under a flagship programme launched by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.

The credit is due to Piyush Goyal. I wish he accomplish his all missions.",2016-03-23 12:32:59
40,"First off I would support someone like Bernie Sanders (he's not a ""communist"", he's actually not saying something too far off from, say, FDR). Hillary is *probably* going to get the nomination though, but even she is better than Trump by a mile. Democrats are the obvious choice right now, and Democrats would be good for America and the world.

I've elaborated on this in considerable detail in other comments both in this thread and in the past why Indians trying to take the moral high ground with the ""haha look at america and europe going to shit, lel trump, lel euronazis"".

What a blowhard politician says himself isn't everything, people give far too much importance to ridiculously sensationalized and extremely leftist American media.

&gt;Also, talking about shootings, you have the police in the US shooting unarmed people

You have to understand that America has the 2nd amendment so police are taught to always think that an uncooperative arrest = assume the suspect is armed. That's what drives the shoot to kill policy. Yes mistakes do happen, but it's nowhere near as wretched as what goes on in India. You should really consider yourself lucky to be living in a western country where human rights abuses aren't anywhere close to India - and if you are not an NRI but an Indian posting on reddit: you should see yourself lucky that you are shielded from all of the human rights violations that happen in the country.

Shooting someone like Michael Brown (an armed robber who got into a scuffle with the police), is just nothing compared with the rampant custodial deaths, custodial rapes and encounter killings that happen in India. People are just beaten up randomly and tortured for being drug addicts by the police. People talk about racial profiling in America, do you think Indian police don't profile ? They profile lower classes, lower castes, muslims and drug addicts.

Indian police is so corrupt that they are regularly just extensions of mob/thug rule in many states, they are paid off to just look the other way in heinous crimes.

&gt;fringe politicians in the US who have said dumb stuff as well. 

Of course they have - except the number of people in India in politics who say completely vile stuff, and the support they have is immeasurably worse.

Trump the political figure as painted by the media could appear as the literal incarnation of Hitler, he's a blowhard and he thrives on the attention - being at the center of a reality show is exactly what he excels at. Think of him as an American Lalu Yadav.

Ultimately just leaders themselves are not everything and ""Modi vs Trump"" makes little sense. What makes even less sense is Indians constantly trying to hold on to the moral high ground by saying ""hey look our politics is so much better"".

For all we know Modi might be a wonderful human being and Trump might be a gigantic douchebag (probably is too). The thing is that's not the entire story. Trump if he does somehow manage to get to power, will be subject to all the checks and balances an American President is held accountable to. Trump doesn't have anything as mainstream AND extreme as parts of the Sangh and their sympathizers supporting him.

I explained this in another comment but there are many leaders who are perfectly civil and ""PC"" but they (or their minions) have wrought far greater evil in countries.",2016-03-23 12:42:29
41,"You do make some good points there. But I am generally talking on the precursor of **what appears to be on face value**. Our conservative leader *appear* as moderate when it comes to extremists views. Trump *appears* to be straight up fascist. I know our leaders are nothing as they pretend to be of-course, but many people take these politicians on the face value. Trump, on the face value, appears to be a narcissistic self loathing and fascist thug. And republican Americans STILL are accepting of this behavior by large. Modi has fooled millions by his political correctness, like Frank Underwood did on TV, so in my view *it is understandable* why Indian public would sympathize with him.

Don't mistake me for denialist and ""America worse, our kuntry besht"" mentality. I have time and again pointed out on this sub that we need to be more accepting of criticism as a nation and not get our panties twisted whenever someone says something bad about this country or generalizes our country.

I am talking of same standards here. US is pretty great overall, except for their expensive as fuck healthcare, education and insanely high gun crimes and military expenditure. A democratic socialist candidate is the most popular candidate in the young America for crying out loud, which is absolutely awesome and worthy of praise. We cannot even dream of a candidate like that in next few decades.

Obviously we are worse off than the US. But as far as Trump is considered, it is highlighting the worst side of America, which we never knew existed. The fact that Political incorrectness and fascism on face value is acceptable to a big chunk of Americans is more troublesome than gullible Indians who fall for political correctness of our dear leader and ignore all the 'fringe elements'. That's the POV I am talking about.",2016-03-23 12:43:20
42,"Thanks, I'm happy that you understand where I'm coming from on this. Yes, I'm pointing out exactly how face value is not everything.

Fascist is a bad word to describe Trump though. He's populist, protectionist, anti-migrant and a blowhard - he isn't authoritarian or dictatorial in any way and has exhibited no sign of trying to kill democracy. Fascist has an extremely specific definition. I wouldn't even call Modi a fascist. KKK is neo-fascist, many parts of the Sangh is neofascist. In Europe the likes of golden dawn, EDL, BNP are fascists. In fact I would argue fascism is a bigger problem in Europe and a much much much bigger problem in India.

On the topic of mislabeling Trump as a fascist, please take a look at this article: 

http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/donald-trump-fascist/424449/

&gt;And republican Americans STILL are accepting of this behavior by large.

Well, we can't say for sure until people actually go to the polls.

&gt;Don't mistake me for denialist and ""America worse, our kuntry besht"" mentality. I have time and again pointed out on this sub that we need to be more accepting of criticism as a nation and not get our panties twisted whenever someone says something bad about this country or generalizes our country.

Yes I know - sorry if my comment made it appear otherwise.

&gt;US is pretty great overall, except for their expensive as fuck healthcare, education and insanely high gun crimes and military expenditure. 

Let's pick these apart shall we: 

Healthcare - America is well on track to becoming a country with insurance coverage for all. Obamacare is insanely popular and no matter what Trump says all he'll do is probably change it slightly. If you look at the average, median per capita income Indian on the other hand, healthcare is just completely out of reach. People just die without basic treatment. People die from a lack of painkillers, something that's just laughably cheap. They literally die from the shock of severe pain from cancer or some such because their village cannot supply pain meds. Public health care centers have stray animals just running around, with ""beds"" just being some rags on the floor. And by stray animals I mean dogs, cats, rats and even pigs. This is what the average Indian has to go through. Yes it is true that amongst the 1st world nations america probably has the worst healthcare for the underprivileged.

&gt;education

America has one of the best higher education systems in the entire world. It is *the* knowledge economy superpower. I'll grant you this that the primary and secondary school system isn't the best and other 1st world countries are better. I hope I don't have to get into how shitty Indian education is. Both at the lowest and highest level, from a free govt level to a private level.

&gt;insanely high gun crimes 

I'll give you this point. Yes, America has a gun problem. But it's deeply attached to America's history and to be quite fair if you look at total gun deaths; a huge number of them are suicides or completely justified actions by the police, or self defense: 

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html

&gt;military expenditure

Look at how much India spends on military at the detriment of healthcare and education. The %s are much worse than America. The %s are worse compared even to other BRICS countries. We just don't have a leg to stand on when we accuse America of spending too much on military.

&gt;A democratic socialist candidate is the most popular candidate in the young America for crying out loud, which is absolutely awesome and worthy of praise. We cannot even dream of a candidate like that in next few decades.

Yes I agree.

All societies have a nasty side, but in America it has been relegated to the fringe. In India the nastiness is very mainstream. Views held by the KKK or EDL are unthinkable in most of the West, in India we hear such stuff regularly emanating from the Sangh.

While America jokingly talks about building a wall to keep out mexicans, we have incidents of Bangladeshis dying to a weirdly fucked-up shoot-to-kill policy; where the value of human life is so worthless that both India and Bangladesh just go ""whoops"" and move on.",2016-03-23 13:05:29

&gt; * He may have some tricks in his bag to introduce before the next election,"" he said, adding that it would be sad for the Congress party if it does not come back to power.Khurshid also accused the Modi government of non- performance.

&gt; * ""I think, it is important for us at this point of time to provide an alternate vision of India of tomorrow that would not rely on his failures or his lack of success,"" Khurshid said yesterday as he gave a critical appraisal of the Modi government since it was voted to power in May, 2014.

63,"&gt;Obama rebuffed congressional advice last year to suspend some aid to Pakistan and impose travel restrictions on Pakistani officials known to have ties to terrorists. Even when Osama bin Laden was found holed up in a lair next to Pakistan’s top military academy, Obama shied away from imposing sanctions.

Those who got fooled by his sloganeering didn't realise what he really meant was ""Yes I can""

&gt;In September 2014, Modi told the UN that “a serious bilateral dialogue with Pakistan” was only possible “without the shadow of terrorism”. But after Obama’s 2015 India visit, Modi made a U-turn in his Pakistan policy, only to induce new cross-border terror attacks, from Gurdaspur to Udhampur.

Obama got it easy here because he saw a man who can be duped and which will be counted as 1 of his many U-turns. Explains why we need a PM who can stick to his ideals.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Peeing in public places may attract a spot fine of Rs 200, while throwing garbage on roads could cost you Rs 100 per day.The Centre has asked all states to emulate a Rajasthan law by April 15 which has penal provisions for littering.

&gt;* The move is seen as the biggest upgrade to Swachh Bharat Mission of Prime Minister Narendra Modi The Centre had earlier planned a central legislation but changed its plans on being advised that states would have to legislate on the subject.BJP-ruled states are now expected to immediately play ball with the Centre's letter to chief secretaries of all states on March 17 asking them to introduce an enabling provision in their state municipal bye-laws by April 15 for levying a spot fine on citizens who defecate in the open or indulge in littering.A timeline has been issued by the Centre asking states to ensure the roll-out of spot fines is done in at least one ward of each city by this April 30 and all cities by September 2018.Urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu had last month cited the example of Singapore where heavy fines on littering are imposed to say such penalties for ensuring cleanliness was a ""last resort"" after creating awareness.His ministry, it its letter to all states on March 17, has stressed that the Swachh Bharat is a ""time-bound mission"" and that its success depends on a large extent on influencing behavior change among citizens.

&gt;* ""It is agreed that once the provisioning has been made and the awareness created, driving behavioral change is also affected by punitive provisions for citizens indulging in wrong practices,"" the letter says.

&gt;* PMO is said to be driving the move, a source said.

76,"Yes I never made the claim that Trump's popularity and the rise of the far-right in Europe are the same thing. Both Bernie and Trump are outside of establishment democrats and republicans and cater to a lot of the insecurities many Americans have that the government isn't working for him, but approached in different ways.

I'm not ""justifying"" the atrocities of the police at all - I'm saying that if something like Michael Brown happened in India no one would bat an eyelid because shit like that happens all the time and nobody cares.

&gt;I have never felt unsafe.

Neither have I. And I never will in my lifetime.

The human rights situation in USA vs India isn't about you or me personally, so anecdotal evidence like this is completely irrelevant. You (or me) would enjoy a really privileged lifestyle in India, which has zero bearing whatsoever on the human rights situation of the country.

Not directed at you obviously, but it really makes me laugh when people actually attempt to compare the human rights situation in America vs India, and try to build the case that ""America is not that good either"". No - it's infinitely better. Unless you are living in a privileged bubble in India, the country is a hellish shithole.

&gt;India hasn't had a Prime Ministerial candidate spouting anything close to the garbage that Trump spews out of his mouth

India has had Indira Gandhi who essentially became a dictator. How on earth does bluster and blowhard comments matter ? Trump isn't even president yet. Also btw, did you ever listen to some of the stuff Modi said before becoming Prime minister ? It's all well and good that he's mellowed down now and is a ""nice guy"", but do we just forget about everything he's said and done ? Yes - Modi was not implicated in the 2002 riots. But innumerable people in the Sangh and his party were. A big reason for the popularity of his party in Gujarat was the idea that muslims are being taught a lesson. That's how fucking bigoted indian society is. Even if someone is 100% innocent, think for just a second how much power someone would wield in a civilized western nation if they were in power when riots where 1000 people died happened EVEN if they were not complicit in any way whatsoever. And you are worried about comments that aren't PC, lol. Or someone punching a heckler.

Try being a heckler at an Indian politician's rally - you'll be skinned alive.

How far would people strongly connected to the KKK get in American politics ? And, how far do sympathizers of equivalent sectons of the Sangh Parivar get in India ?

The biggest irony of all is people sitting in America telling Indians what to think, I can empathize with Indians who are clueless about American politics, but this is just sad. And what's worse - they support a far FAR left candidate like Bernie in America, but an extremely right ideology of Hindutva in India. And a very right-wing political party, the BJP which has very strong connections with the far-right. 

&gt;As if the human-rights abuses that do exist in the US are nothing to worry about.

Here's the rub - most NRIS *are* in another country, where they probably *do* get worried about the 'murrican far right turning its sights on the Indian community, or the police force doing the same.

But in India since it's always going to be ""those other people"", where naturally these NRIs won't particularly care. So they jump to the party that protects them and panders to them (the dems). Hilariously, when muslims or dalits are pandered to in India, the same set of NRIs will cry about ""secular vote bank politics"". Lolmax self-centered world views. Because thinking about the marginalized for even one second hurts the great desi nationalist ego. Muh roots and all that.

&gt;Y implies that Y has no faults whatsoever.

Said no one ever. The faults of America are discussed every day on reddit, in American and international media. But the faults of India, Hindus, and Indian society ?

85,"&gt; I'm saying that if something like Michael Brown happened in India no one would bat an eyelid 

You've talked to all 1.2 billion Indians and found out that ""no one cares""? The whole Ishrat Jahan thing, as fraudulent as it was, is an instance of people and media ""not caring"" about extrajudicial killings? You have zero basis to label an entire nation as apathetic simply based on your own personal opinion and anecdotal evidence.

&gt; it really makes me laugh when people actually attempt to compare the human rights situation in America vs India, [...] Unless you are living in a privileged bubble in India, the country is a hellish shithole.

Stating that India has never had a PM candidate akin to Trump doesn't translate to ""comparing the human rights situation between US and India"". No wider context has been invoked, and no wider comparison has been made. Trump is far worse than any PM candidate India has had, and that's the extent of the argument. Extrajudicial killings and what random fringe politicians say are irrelevant; no one even brought it up.

&gt; India has had Indira Gandhi who essentially became a dictator.

Oh hey somebody moved the goalposts. Indira became a dictator, **but that still doesn't change the fact that India still hasn't had a PM candidate like Trump**. If you want to talk about bad leaders of state, there's Nixon who among numerous other things, went out of his way to **actively support** Pakistan's atrocities in Bangladesh. You talk about Indira Gandhi as a counterexample to Trump as if to establish that US is not a ""hellish shithole"" like India. The last administration invaded a country under false pretexts. Compared to that Indira Gandhi is a blip. We can do this all day, but guess what, **it doesn't matter because no one brought it up**.

&gt; Trump isn't even president yet. 

He is a serious contender for the position, has openly-racist positions, and even more troubling, **has wide support**. It's telling that you have to bring up random things like extrajudicial killings, Indira Gandhi, and whatever other random bullshit because you know for a fact that you have *zero examples* of an equivalent situation in India. I know that you consider India to be an extremely horrible place and so it probably causes you cognitive dissonance that in *this* instance India *is* actually better than the US. But that's your problem, not mine.

&gt; Also btw, did you ever listen to some of the stuff Modi said before becoming Prime minister ? [...] do we just forget about everything he's said and done ? 

There's no example of anything he's said that is even remotely close to the level of batshit insanity shown by Trump. The Indian media was already trying to portray Modi as some sort of Hindu Nazi, so I'm sure you can find numerous examples to prove otherwise.

&gt; Modi was not implicated in the 2002 riots. But innumerable people in the Sangh and his party were.

You can say the same about politicians in the US. Republicans kept bringing up the racist preacher who preached at Obama's church. But guess what, people didn't give a shit, **because it wasn't Obama being racist**, just like **Modi wasn't implicated**. 

&gt; A big reason for the popularity of his party in Gujarat was the idea that muslims are being taught a lesson. That's how fucking bigoted indian society is. 

[Clearly.](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-wins-over-muslim-electorate-in-gujarat/1/238743.html). Also, hilarious how you went from Gujarat to ""Indian society"" as a whole. 

&gt; [...] think for just a second how much power someone would wield in a civilized western nation if they were in power when riots where 1000 people died happened EVEN if they were not complicit [...] 

This is such an idiotic argument. One would assume **the fact that they were not complicit** would outweigh anything because, I dunno, **most people are smart enough to know that guilt-by-association is bullshit**? Or maybe you know, because **the apex court of the country found that he was not complicit**? Or maybe, could it be the fact that the apex court found that **he did everything he could to gain control of the situation and stop the riots**? 

&gt; And you are worried about comments that aren't PC, lol.

Worried? No. But I'm absolutely amused by this trainwreck of an argument that you're presenting: America is better than India because a) India has a PM who was not only found non-complicit, but found to have exerted due diligence in controlling a riot and b) Trump is not a big deal because he's just a loudmouth, obnoxious racist with openly racist, xenophobic, and misogynistic views who also happens to enjoy **widespread support among Republican constituents**. Yeah, real stellar argument there champ.

&gt; Try being a heckler at an Indian politician's rally - you'll be skinned alive.

lolyeah not like [this](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/11/22/video_trump_supporters_beat_up_black_lives_matter_protester_at_rally.html) [shit](http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2016-02-27/police-3-stabbed-at-kkk-gathering-in-southern-california) [happens](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-trump-20160313-story.html) in the US. And ""not that bad of a guy"" Trump kinda supports it too. Sure, there is no comparison in the kind of poll violence you see in India vs. the US, but guess what **no one was even talking about that**. You know what I was talking about? **Trump being a jackass and how India hasn't had a PM candidate like that**. 

&gt; How far would people strongly connected to the KKK get in American politics ? And [...] sympathizers of equivalent sectons of the Sangh Parivar get in India ?

**L-O-FUCKING-L**. [Do](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/25/politics/david-duke-donald-trump-immigration/) [some](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/28/politics/donald-trump-white-supremacists/) [research](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelangelo-signorile/post_10496_b_8544540.html) [plox](http://www.vocativ.com/news/206807/white-supremacists-and-nazis-for-trump/). Your boy Trump has endorsements from the KKK and White Supermacist groups, but oh noo he's not getting far in American politics at all, no siree. Hilarious how you're completely discounting the fact that Trump **has openly aired his racist sentiments**, but apparently that's not as bad as not having such sentiments, but having support from racist groups. Oh but wait, Trump has that too, **but India is still a hellish shithole and America is better because fuck I don't even know anymore because this whole Fukushima of an argument makes no fucking sense**.

&gt; The biggest irony of all is people sitting in America telling Indians what to think, 

I'll tell you what's irony: the fact that you're sitting here claiming people sitting in America shouldn't tell people in India what to think, **but you're doing the exact same thing telling people in the US that Trump's ""not that bad""**. To make it clear, the irony in the situation is that your expected outcome of bolstering your argument and claiming the existence of irony was completely undone by a) your hypocritical argument b) failure to show irony. **NOW THAT'S FUCKING IRONY**.

&gt; I can empathize with Indians who are clueless about American politics, but this is just sad. 

Yeah it's pretty obvious who's demonstrated a better grasp of American politics.

&gt; And what's worse - they support a far FAR left candidate like Bernie in America, but an extremely right ideology of Hindutva in India.

Oh hello there false dilemma. Or, y'know, maybe it's something like oh I dunno, a person is not *entirely* left-wing or *entirely* right-wing? That they espouse some policies from both sides, because, you know, everyone talks about where they are on a **political spectrum**? It is idiotic to claim that simply because a person supports the BJP, they necessarily buy into the Hindutva agenda or that they are rightwingislamophobichindunazis. Not that I have to justify anything, least of all to you, but the BJP is the only party in India that actually has an implementation of a secular framework (UCC) as part of their platform. In addition, India is a classic example of too much socialism, where US is an example of too little (especially post-Reagan) with an over-reliance in the idea that the ""free market will solve everything"". I don't trust governments, but I trust corporations even less. I think that there needs to be a set of regulations loose enough to allow growth, but strong enough to disincentivize predatory, anti-consumer, and monopolistic business-practices. So I'm sorry that I fit into your neat little bucket of hindufascistislamophobes or whatever you think I am, but honestly I really don't give a fuck.

&gt; [...] most NRIS are in another country, where they probably do get worried about the 'murrican far right turning its sights on the Indian community, [...] So they jump to the party that protects them and panders to them (the dems).

Yes please tell me my reasons for supporting the democrats. Clearly you know better. 

&gt; Hilariously, when muslims or dalits are pandered to in India, the same set of NRIs will cry about ""secular vote bank politics"".

Because pandering to the Indian diaspora is exactly what the Democrats do and exactly why I support them. Apparently supporting the UCC is also votebank politics. Indian ""leftists"" need to get this through their self-hating and self-described ""liberal"" and ""intellectual"" skulls - i don't give **a flying fuck** about *who* you are, who you *think* you are, your religion, caste, color, or any of that fucking crap. And I think governments should think the same fucking way too. **That is why support the UCC and that is why I support the Democrats, because as flawed as they are they are the only party moving in that direction.** But if it makes it easy for you to deal with this complicated world by reducing everything to absolutes, fucking have at it. God knows critical thinking isn't for everyone. 

I'm fucking done here.",2016-03-24 12:24:29
86,"No hatred or political agenda against PM Modi: Kanhaiya Kumar: The Hindu

---

&gt;* He was only demanding honour and respect for all nationalities on university campuses which had come under increasing attacks under the present regime headed by Mr. Modi.

&gt;* He recalled that when fascism emerged in Germany under Hitler's rule, the prime target of the rulers was the organised sector.

&gt;* The most organised sector in the present days were the university campuses as they contributed in a large manner to the right to expression which was the core of democracy.

&gt;* Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar blamed the Modi government for the attacks as it aimed to cover up failures owing to development agenda taking the back seat in the last two years.

&gt;* He condemned the violence on UoH campus two days ago in the wake of the return of the Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao and said it was triggered by people who were already deployed in the VC's office.

90,"First off it's pretty odd that you think I'm a Trump fan when I've clearly said that Bernie and failing that, Hillary is the best candidate.

Extrajudicial killings, snooping, custodial deaths, rapes and human rights atrocities simply are not major electoral issues. We don't even have any kind of overall anti-war movement, that's how ignorant most Indians are and how little they care about anything. Most of the Indian electorate doesn't even understand the level of inequality in the country - things really are that tragic. India is a democracy which is decided by an eternally impoverished poor class that is driven by anti-incumbency : i.e. vote the MP/MLA out of power when prices become unbearable. That's all what matters in India.

Every time you talk about ""Indians"" you are looking out of your own little urban elite bubble and comparing that with the average American. You take the most progressive and educated set of Indians, and compare them to the masses of America.

This subreddit is predominantly about India - maybe you should try /r/ABCDesis if you want to look at the American NRI perspective on everything. You can also see some bonus discussion on how white people celebrating Holi is the end of the world from some people there. This is an Indian subreddit so why exactly should I be obsessed with criticizing Trump ? Anyhow I've done that too a number of times.

&gt;Stating that India has never had a PM candidate akin to Trump 

The entire Indian political system is such a joke, this comparison is meaningless. Sorry NRIs want feel all fuzzy inside about their homeland being some wonderland, it's not. We have a handful of competent leaders and whether or not they ""say"" anything that's not PC is irrelevant. We've had people like Indira Gandhi become basically dictators, we have Narendra Modi launching to power after not being able to stop riots in the state that he was chief minister. Should we talk about Modi's comments during the gaurav yatra ? [Source](http://www.sabhlokcity.com/2013/09/analysis-of-modis-9-september-2002-hate-speech-at-bahucharaji-gujarat-gaurav-yatra/) what about the [muslims are dogs comments](http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-narendra-modi-s-puppy-remark-is-as-bad-as-rajiv-gandhi-s-when-a-tree-falls-comment-1860801) ? Personally I don't care, but you seem to give a huge amount of significance to bluster. Shouldn't we use the same standards ?

When an Indian leader like Rajiv Gandhi justifies the massacre of Sikhs, that's okay; but when Trump jokingly says ""lets build a wall to keep out mexicans"" (which obviously will never happen) that's somehow unacceptable in comparison. You can't have both.

Somehow all of these things Indian leaders say are okay because none of these people ""say"" anything that's not politically correct (and even that's not precisely true). Jyoti Basu presided over a reign of terror and was extremely close to becoming PM - he watched over encounter killings throughout a state and crushed all opposition with terror. But that's all fine and dandy to people like you because he isn't a blowhard, he just stabs you in the back silently. He was always a very ""sensible"" and shrewd politician, never making idiotic comments in the media. Slobodan Milosevic too is a really nice guy, because largely he's PC in his conversations with media, amirite ?

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Demand-for-justice-for-victims-of-Burdwan-Sainbari/articleshow/19022991.cms

&gt;The Sains who were known to be Congress loyalists were attacked and two brothers Pranab Sain and Moloy Sain were brutally murderd in front of their mother and later their mother Mriganayani was forced to eat rice which was stained with her sons blood.

And here we are talking about hecklers getting punched. 

You keep pointing out Trump supporters beating up hecklers. Like I told you earlier: what about BJP and CPM people in Kerala just murdering each other ? What about political goondaism where UP/Bihar political thugs just murder entire villages, same shit happens in UP too. Is that all ""irrelevant"" because you aren't willing to step out of your NRI-visiting-india urban bubble where it doesn't affect you ?

Try heckling Modi at one of his rallies or try throwing a tomato at him and see where you would land up. Any politician for that matter, left or right.

&gt;Your boy Trump has endorsements from the KKK and White Supermacist groups

So ? Everyone knows about this. Trump doesn't come from the KKK, he wasn't a lifelong wizard if-you-know-what-i-mean, and neither did he get popular based off murderous riots. KKK is fringe in America. This would be like saying naxalites who barely vote support the congress ergo congress is pro naxalite. Trumps ""base"" isn't the KKK and I think you yourself stated this a few comments ago. You also seem to not understand that I don't like Trump at all so ""your boy Trump"" is odd. Modi's dedicated *base* is the Sangh and their sympathizers. A large portion of the Sangh is as bad as the KKK, or the BNP/EDL in the UK.

&gt;a person is not entirely left-wing or entirely right-wing?

Actually there's another word for that. Political opportunism and selfish voting or that wonderful word modi fanboys love : ""hypocrisy"". Where only issues that affect you from your own perspective matter. This is one of the reasons why vote bank politics exists, and democracy as a system often fails. Many Indians are deeply conservative, selfish and prejudiced against the marginalized or ""the other"", so this kind of attitude doesn't really surprise me.

Dems in America pander to Blacks and Latinos as much as parties like the congress pander to Muslims. Yet of course NRIs never have a problem with this. They don't go shouting pseudo-sec or other genius-level social media buzzwords for that. Because that's when they become good-boys and good-girls - 'model minorities'.

And about that random rant about UCC. Where is the BJP on UCC ? or was this just a desperate comedic touch at the end of your comment ?

I would be totally fine with UCC - I'm a Hindu so it would actually benefit me. I would be okay with total separation of church and state because I think fundamentalist religion is a disease. I find both namaaz in the morning and fukken bihari bhajans on loudspeaker loathsome, and if they were all banned that's good too. I would actually like a French hardline version of secularism, where no outward religious display is allowed - and burqas or niqabs are banned.

But I understand that in a country like India that's simply not realistic. BJP understands this, Congress understands this, everyone does. It's only a handful of clueless and naive right wing 'optimists' that keep thinking this will actually change that do not.

I don't support any party in India, I don't even vote. They're all garbage. It's just that BJP turned out to be an ever bigger disappointment than I'd expected, and the cancerous Sangh is now quite malignant. 

&gt;In addition, India is a classic example of too much socialism
&gt;US is an example of too little (especially post-Reagan) with an over-reliance in the idea that the ""free market will solve everything""

Hilarious - at no point has this even been about economics. Why don't you tell us what kind of welfare schemes India has and how they are comparable to America ? Wanna talk about public healthcare ? Because by that metric India is nowhere. Crony capitalism is far worse in India - completely unregulated capitalism where cooperations will just hire thugs to murder people to get off their land, in bed with ... wait for it ... the congress. Of course the BJP still continues the same good work started by the congress.

The BJP is just as socialist as the Congress if the last few budgets are any indication. Did you actually listen to all of it ? I listen to every word of every budget, for the last 4-5 years. There's barely any significant change in economic policy. This is another example of pre-election rhetoric being meaningless, because it doesn't really match what follows.

&gt;you're doing the exact same thing telling people in the US that Trump's ""not that bad""

Nope not at all. Everyone *should* be voting for Hillary or Bernie - a democrat. Trump is much much worse than either of them. But given the very robust nature of the American political system even if Trump were to come to power he would probably be just another Reagan.

It's also rather intriguing how NRIs immediately look at America through a leftist lens where the American (leftist) media is unquestionable, but the moment a leftist lens or even center-left lens is used for Indian politics that suddenly becomes ""evil bloody pseudo-secular anti-national"". Critical thinking is something modi and Sangh acolytes have a problem with.

Since you're a Bernie supporter and Democrat, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and consider you an NRI that just isn't that well informed on India. Which is actually fine. Lot of Indians are quite ignorant about Indian politics too.",2016-03-24 17:48:46

Of course this is the case. 

When you have a central government that completely ignores family planning what do you expect to happen.

Furthermore, this river linking scheme the Modi-government is trying to revive is going to be a fucking disaster.

River-linking is a crime against nature. How about instead of linking rivers you just control your population growth, Christ. India's population is expected to peak between 1.6 billion and 1.8 billion sometime around 2060 according to a recent UN study. That is simply unsustainable.

&gt;* The Odisha unit of peasants organisation All-India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha (AIKMS) has decided to oppose Mahanadi-Godavari river linking project as well as over-promotion of ground water use for agriculture in the State.

&gt;* Speaking to newsmen, organisation national general secretary Sushant Jha and State president Natabar Pradhan claimed that river linking project and over-tapping of ground water would be a major bane for environment and agriculture.

&gt;* They criticised the government for over-promotion of bore wells for irrigation purposes, which, according to them, would be a major reason of ground water depletion in near future.

&gt;* Our aim is to make micro level analysis of problems being faced by farmers and possible remedial measures through discussions, said national committee member of AIKMS Bhala Chandra Sarangi.

&gt;* Mr. Natabar Sarangi was sceptical about the second green revolution being promoted by the NDA government in eastern India, including Odisha.

&gt; * And others say that Mr Modi agreed to stick with a budget deficit of 3.5%, which is restrained by Indian standards, in order to save up for a bigger splash next year, when the more crucial state elections loom.

---

&gt;* 3) And can you please stop singling out California's Hindu children for condemnation as somehow being innately casteist and sexist because of their very identity while the role of other religions in worldwide genocide and imperialist is sanitized?

&gt;* A group of South Asia Studies professors continue to think that none of the above concerns are valid, and an entire mass movement of parents, students, and scholars that has lasted one whole decade now is nothing more than a Hindu nationalist ""revisionist"" conspiracy.

&gt;* A community trying to fight off colonial-era myths about it being taught as fact and history, or a group of scholars deploying the privilege of their positions to assert a dogmatic theory about India never having existed before 1947 over children?

&gt;* The scholars, it appears, would rather lose the chance for thousands of children to learn that the two greatest epics of Indian civilization were written by people born into lower-caste all in the name of empowering them.

&gt;* They do not see a need to fight orientalism in their own academic paradigms, rooted in the privileged halls of Western academia, and crushing the hopes and dreams of a postcolonial people in a minority situation again and again.

&gt;* I know someone personally who interacts with the Finance ministry bureaucrats and the word is that there is a lot of FDI waiting to enter India but has been held back due to stalling of reforms by the opposition.

&gt;* Even after 65 years, India didn't have electricity in all the villages, proper roads, an efficient railways, closing on the disagreements with neighboring countries and even giving the Defense personnel their due.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Indian economy is expected to grow at 7.2 per cent in 2016-17, a tad lower than Central Statistics Office's advance estimates of 7.6 per cent in the current fiscal due to weak investments and external headwinds, says BMI Research.

&gt; * ""We forecast India's real GDP growth to come in at 7.2 per cent for FY17 from our estimate of 7.3 per cent in FY16 and 7.2 per cent in FY15,"" the research firm said in a statement.Indian economy continues to face multiple challenges, and this is being reflected in high frequency data such as industrial production and trade, it added.

&gt; * ""Weak private investment and external headwinds will be hurdles to higher growth, and we forecast real GDP growth to come in at 7.2 per cent in FY2016/17 (versus 7.3 per cent in FY2015/16), the statement said.Central Statistics Office had projected 7.6 per cent GDP growth rate in its advance estimates for the current fiscal released earlier in February this year.Contrary to the BMI Research view, last month the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament had termed external environment as challenging.However, the Survey had projected a 7-7.5 per cent GDP growth rate in the next fiscal which could accelerate to eight per cent in a couple of years.But it had cautioned that if the world economy remains weak, India's growth would face considerable headwinds.According to Japanese financial services major Nomura, India's GDP growth is likely to pick up to 7.8 per cent in fiscal 2016-17 from 7.6 per cent this year, largely driven by higher discretionary demand.BMI Research said, ""Modi administration remains committed in enacting incremental economic reforms, which we believe will be positive for economic growth over the coming years.

&gt; * ""The disinflationary environment, coupled with the government's fiscal prudence, opens space for the Reserve Bank of India to reduce its repurchase (repo) rate as it attempts to support the economy.

more gems

&gt;At this moment in its long tumultuous history, India is seeing a renaissance of a narrowly defined, ultranationalist, militant Hindutva ideology. Modi is the poster child of this ideology. This ideology places a lot of emphasis on India’s most beloved epics and historical stories. Sadly at the heart of these ballad like mythological stories lie lurid tales of sex that glorify rape.
The God Vishnu is said to have raped Tulsi/Vrinda by assuming the guise of her husband.
On seeing her husband, Vrinda was delighted, she forgot her sorrow, dormant passions kindled up. She embraced her husband right there in the middle of the forest. But, at the end of the intercourse she realized that it was Vishnu and not her husband. Vrinda rebuked him angrily. Vrinda said, “Fie on Vishnu in outraging the modesty of another man’s wife.”

and theres more

&gt;Yet this horrible act is justified and glorified, because Indians believe that Tulsi’s husband, Shankachuda/Jalandhar, was invincible in war unless her chastity was first destroyed. Therefore to defeat Jalandhar, it was imperative and gallant of Vishnu to rape Tulsi. Vishnu is seen as a hero for raping her.

---

&gt;* It has become apparent that the Americans are making great efforts to establish a military and political partnership with India, a major power that has traditionally gravitated towards maintaining good relations with Russia.

&gt;* During his meeting with the Indian PM Modi, Vladimir Putin said Russia was in favour of India becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council, noting that it was a great power, conducting a balanced and responsible foreign policy.

&gt;* The fact that the Indian authorities are seeking to diversify their suppliers, buying weapons not only from Russia, but also from the United States, Israel, and other countries, does not indicate any anti-Russian intentions on the part of Delhi, the analyst said in an interview with the Russkaya Planeta.

&gt;* Most analysts agree that Modis government was elected on the basis of its policy of pragmatism, and this is understandable because, despite the fact that in the first months of 2016, India has managed to overtake China in terms of economic growth rate, a large proportion of the countrys population still lives below the poverty line.

&gt;* Washington, according to many analysts, is making every effort to derail the current Indo-Russian partnership, and it is hoped that Indian politicians maintain the necessary cool headedness, and keep at the right distance from their American colleagues, and not become involved in the confrontation between the West and Russia.

&gt; * Indias leadership in establishing the International Solar Alliance (ISA) which was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris last fall,is a part of New Delhis big bet on solar.

&gt; * Within this context, Modi took the lead in organizing the International Solar Alliance.

&gt; * There are however impediments to be overcome if India is to exercise international leadership through the International Solar Alliance.

&gt; * Standing at the junction of technology, finance, and consumer application, India, through its domestic solar bet and the International Solar Alliance, can have a transformative effect on the application of solar power and earn its place in the sun.

&gt;* Instead, the factory promises to create an enormous, positive ripple effect both inside and outside India that will impact employment and supply chains, as well as promote radical new designs and industrial innovation like never before.

&gt;* This means that places like the Chakan plant will be pressed into service to handle global production shortfalls by simply printing out nozzles from India thanks to a CAD design of the part housed on their server.

&gt;* Sharing information in real time will allow the factory's computers and machines to adapt to changes in the production schedule, deal with downtime, avoid shutdowns, and manage inventory.

&gt;* GE's Oil and Gas unit in Japan, for instance, designed and printed a key control valve part for its Kariwa plant in Niigata Prefecture in just two weeks, when it would have previously taken three months.

&gt;* The Economic Times reported that an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) committees proposal for a three-fold fee increase, along with the creation of a 2,000-crore non-banking finance company (NBFC) to achieve greater financial autonomy for the schools, is finding favor with India Inc.

158,"&gt;The developed countries already had good GDP before internet became popular and cheap.
Do you realize that you are reading that correlation completely backwards? Those countries have good broadband penetration because they have high GDP and people in those countries are rich enough to buy high speed internet connections. If India's median income was as high as those countries, we would also have amazing internet penetration, no problem.

I meant GPD growth rate, not GDP, sorry.

&gt;we would also have amazing internet penetration, no problem.

So you do admit that our internet penetration is not ""amazing"". The way you were defending broadband, it felt like you were defending a broadband superpower. Even Facebook has one day in the week with low speed internet to remind themselves how poor internet is in India. If that doesn't speak for itself, I don't know what will. What will it take you to admit that internet simply isn't up to international standards in India?

&gt;This is one of the stupidest things I have heard, and everyone keeps repeating it as if this is such a jewel of idea. What do you think changing the definition of broadband will achieve? Is it going to change the supply-demand equations of internet services in our country? ISPs will simply keep the same plans and start calling it ""high-speed internet"" instead broadband.

It's a sign that they're moving up. I doubt the US government would be doing it if it was ""stupid"".

&gt;Because it is not govenment's job to run businesses.

Why not participate in opportunities with future earnings potential? What's so wrong with it?

Even if it ceases to be an ISP, it should still invest in infrastructural projects that will make it easier for private players to set up and operate. Hopefully this ease will translate into better tariffs. Broadband and telecommunications are sectors that need a boost and I'm sure I'm not being unreasonable by expecting the government to give it a boost.

&gt;* After the recent meeting of its Pratinidhi Sabha at Rajasthans Nagaur, the RSS leaders on Tuesday held discussions with top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders at Deendayal Shodh Sansthan.

&gt;* Sources said the RSS leaders expressed displeasure over the remarks made by Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu, describing Modi as Gods gift to the nation, and suggested the BJP leadership not encourage individual worship as organisation is supreme in the RSS.

&gt;* Naidu made the comments while presenting political resolution on the last day of the national executive meeting on Sunday.

&gt;* According to sources, the issue of reservation also came up at the meet and BJP leaders requested the RSS leadership not to express its views publicly on reservation because it embarrasses them and the prime minister is required to clarify the partys position on the issue.

having said that why you get good assembly required furniture abroad is for example an ikea bed for 295pounds is because they have offloaded the per hour 100pound skilled labor as a customers problem and more so by automatizing everything to such an extent that some items are not even touched by more than a couple of humans. BECAUSE LABOR IS FUCKING EXPENSIVE. here the labor to automatizing ratio is heavy towards keeping it labor intensive.

when ikea comes to india they will have to source 50% of the furniture from india as per the specifics of the fdi as per my last understanding of it. I think that has been removed. none the less they will be giving full assembly backup to ""educate"" the customer to get used to assembling furniture in the future. kinda ease them into it.

but imho IKEA IS SHIT. they are coming to this country and they will decimate the poor small furniture manufacturer and contractors, in fact the whole unorganized sector which is completely neglected/heavily taxed/non incentivized/ harrased by officials at every step till death, with ready made SHIT which doesn't last more than a couple of years. and people will pay for it.

* Shinzō Abe, current Prime Minister of Japan; no word on whether or not he still practices TM.

* Dilma Rouseff, current President of Brazil; Her government is currently negotiating to have 48,000 school teachers trained as TM teachers--one for each public school in Brazil--so that all 45 million public school students in Brazil can learn TM for free. The police department of Rio [is currently checking](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/hum-guns-rios-elite-police-meditate-peace-mind-161737158--oly.html) to see if every police officer should learn TM in time for the Olympics.

* Juan Manuel Santos, current President of Colombia; His government works with [Father Gabriel Mejia](http://www.claret.org/en/news/03-01-2010/gabriel-mejia-cmf-archbishop-romero-prize-2008), sending him all the former child rebels hey capture for rehabilitation in his orphanages and centers and recently the government has announced that all juvenile offenders will be taught TM and yogic flying as part of their prison sentence.



* Yukio Hatoyama, the former Prime Minister of Japan; He just gave the [Commencement Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY0gRUP_wEM) at the Maharishi University of Management and said that he and his wife are dedicated to getting as many students as possible in Japan involved in TM.




* Joaquim Chissano, the former President of Mozambique; He won Africa's highest honor for the work he did while President, which [he insists was entirely due to his involvement with TM](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/22/jamesastill), earning him the nickname [""the meditating president""](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/out-the-darkness/201212/can-meditation-change-the-world).


&gt;There's even Yogic Flying Competitions.

Here's a fun little video of [Boy Scouts in Colombia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6daNyp884Po) practicing Yogic Flying. In fact, all 5,000 of the children in the care of [Father Gabriel Mejia](http://www.claret.org/en/news/03-01-2010/gabriel-mejia-cmf-archbishop-romero-prize-2008) practice TM and all the older kids and the 800 staff in the [orphanages he runs](http://www.fundacionhogaresclaret.org/index.php/english-site) practice TM and Yogic Flying as well.

The kids in the orphanages are former child sex-workers rescued off the streets of Medellin or child-rebels captured by the Colombian government and given over to Father Mejia for [rehabilitation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4sS3tHvQRQ).

Father Mejia's rehabilitation network has a 75+% success rate for reintegrating these kids into society, and the Colombian government now wants all juvenile offenders at all prisons in that country to participate in TM and Yogic Flying.

But hey, its all a scam.

190,"It could be seen that a flat industrial output growth rate so far in this financial year is signalling that the growth momentum in the economy has remained vulnerable.

---

&gt; * With the implementation of the seventh Pay Commission and OROP recommendations as well as a potential upturn in rural demand, it is expected that domestic consumption demand will increase and this would boost India's economic growth going forward.In view of various initiatives initiated by the Modi government and on the basis of the Budget focus on a few sectors and emerging strength in the Indian economy, companies and sectors that are likely to be the key beneficiaries include banks and financial companies, FMCG , infrastructure, oil and natural gas, auto and IT.The government has been giving a concerted push to accelerate growth through its various initiatives such as 'Make in India', 'Digital India', 'Skilled India', 'Housing for all' and much others and states are competing with each other, which has added to the dynamism of the Indian economy.In the Union Budget , it could be seen that the government prioritised bolstering domestic demand, particularly rural consumption, without endangering its commitment to fiscal consolidation.Actually, deteriorating corporate profitability, a depreciating currency and concerns that the reforms momentum has grown slower have badly impacted some of the Indian blue chip companies, especially in the capital goods sector.The capital goods sector has been reeling under pressure, with the size of the market and the total production stagnating at $41 billion and $33.4 billion in FY 15.

&gt; * Over the past three years, the $41 billion Indian capital goods industry has seen production grow at just 1 per cent CAGR.In order to increase production of capital goods over next 10 years and increase the share of exports from 27 per cent to 40 per cent of production and reduce the share of imports from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, the government has issued the national capital goods policy 2016.Some Indian steel companies have started performing better on the operational front but on the financial front, most of them are debt-laden and are on the verge of default.

&gt; * In order to rescue the debt-laden Indian steel companies, the government has decided to impose minimum import price (MIP) on steel products.In order to illuminate the power sector, the government has launched the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) to turn around the highly-indebted state power distribution companies, which have debt of almost Rs 4.3 lakh crore.The rescue plan UDAY, as per the government, would be implemented through four initiatives - improving operational efficiencies of dicoms, reducing cost of power, reducing interest cost of discoms and enforcing financial discipline on discoms through alignment with state finances.With the recent weak IIP data (third time in a row) that came in at 1.5 per cent (January 2016) driven by a sharp decline in production of capital goods and consumables and inflation in the comfortable zone, it is expected that the Reserve Bank of India in its April monetary policy review will lower interest rates and if that happens, this would be a significant step from the central bank to push growth in the economy.It could be seen that a flat industrial output growth rate so far in this financial year is signalling that the growth momentum in the economy has remained vulnerable.However, going forward India is hopeful of gaining momentum as the government continues to undertake structural reforms, and the continuous decline in oil prices, which has helped the Indian economy shrink the current account deficit (CAD), should provide the much-needed relief to the government on the fiscal front.

The tobacco lobby has ensured that India' pledge to take hard-hitting measures to reduce the use of tobacco at a regional meeting of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Timor-Leste remains just in paper and nowhere near action!

In a paper in the ‘British Medical Journal’, British experts Nicholas S Hopkinson Martin McKee, and K Srinath Reddy of the Public Health Foundation of India say that some governments in Asia were complicit in protecting the interests of the tobacco industry.

The paper titled ‘Tobacco industry lobbying undermines public health in Asia’ identifies India, Pakistan and Laos where the tobacco industry was reportedly targeting control policies.


It says: “The implementation of tobacco control measures is a political choice. Although tobacco control will improve the wellbeing of the populations that governments serve, the industry spares no attempt to deter, dilute, or delay effective measures for tobacco control, be it taxation or prominent pictorial health warnings”.

* Adhaar compulsory for 10th, 12th and graduation in govt and govt aided schools/colleges. Private won't be far behind.

* Adhaar compulsory for ecomm, buying cars, bikes, cycles, homes, malls, highways/tollways, railways, airways, metro etc etc.

* Adhaar compulsory for giving all govt exams, including UPSC.

Dear Narendra Modi,

I read that you paused your speech when you heard Azaan.

Please remember - As a muslim, I don't expect you to pause your speech when you hear Azaan. You are under no obligation to stop your speech when you hear Azaan as you are not a practising muslim.

The only expectation from you is : You should protect the minorities (not just muslims) during the riots. From the goons who were unleashed on this country when you came to power. In Gujarat and outside Gujarat.

We expect you to take action against your ministers when they make provocative anti-muslim speeches/statements.

We expect you to stop the persecution of innocent muslims at the hands of security agencies.

We expect you to ensure justice is delivered to all those innocent muslims who became victims of your political ambition from Godhra to Muzaffar Nagar.

We expect you to take necessary measures to expedite the trials of all those innocent muslims who are languishing in jails on false terror charges.

We expect you to take necessary measures to prevent mob lynching of muslims the way it happened in Dadri.

We expect you to send a strong message to perpetrators when innocent muslim cattle traders hanged by Gau Raksha Activists.

So next time you are delivering a speech and you hear Azaan, please continue with your speech. Just remember what we expect from you.

Thank you!",2016-03-28 09:24:01

On randia you will find people arguing so many times, that India doesn't elect the prime minister, but it votes for the representatives, who in-turn elect the prime minister. Well, they don't vote for the ruling party or CM either, if same logic is extended. If the representatives don't find the CM's performance well enough, they have the right to form a separate party or defect to other party. That's what happened when Sankarsinh Vaghela became CM of gujarat with support from Congress. 

Let's not get into accusations of horse-trading. [It's pretty clear when randia ignores such issues,](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/uttarakhand-congress-rebels-sting-harish-rawat/) [and when it forgets them.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Arvind-Kejriwal-encouraged-horse-trading-to-form-govt-in-Delhi/articleshow/46529842.cms) 

For those who don't like Modi, well, here is the thing. You still need a central party around which a coalition can form. If you reaaaaaly want Modi to go away in 2019, send a strong message to Congress leadership that they need to up the ante.

264,"&gt; have just shown how pathetic and incompetent Congress leadership

No it doesn't. If congress were really that pathetic or incompetent than all it's members would have defected. There are some bad apples aka members who will sell their membership for money in every party. There was an **anti-defection law** to prevent exactly this kind of phenomenon. Situation gets more critical in smaller state where defection of few members can change the balance of the house. Some of these smaller states are also critical from security point of view. Therefore anti-defection law was also beneficial for national security. But Jaitley says the said law doesn't exist as of now. 

&gt; Congress is in full panic mode.

As they should be and the country is also panicking with them. This kind of extra-constitutional and anti-democratic process should put any peace-loving Indian in to not just panic but also action. Because government toppling in border areas or Maoist-effected area will not be met favorably with the people who live there and who want to be represented by people who they have elected and not by president-rule. 

&gt; they have the right to form a separate party

Nothing wrong with your logic. Except there used to an anti-defection law to prevent horse-trading. If **significant proportion (33%)** of members want to defect than it is all right. But one or two members defecting indicates there is something *daal mein kalaa*

&gt; Let's not get into accusations of horse-trading

No one is going into accusation. But it is very much clear to anyone with any sort intelligence that such defection don't happen without large sum of money involved. This is also something over which the entire country should ponder.

&gt; If you reaaaaaly want Modi to go away in 2019,

There is a good probability that Modi may die before 2019.",2016-03-28 13:38:01
265,"&gt;No it doesn't. If congress were really that pathetic or incompetent than all it's members would have defected.

That doesn't make any sense. It is like saying if global warming was real, all the polar caps would melt away once and not gradually.

&gt;There was an anti-defection law to prevent exactly this kind of phenomenon. 

Anti-defection law was used in Uttarakhand and 9 MLA were disqualified by speaker. However issue is that speaker passed the budget without division even when 35 out of 70 members on assembly wanted it. That alone is enough to send signal that something is wrong with the Uttarakhand assembly and government. 

&gt;As they should be and the country is also panicking with them.

I don't see any panic anywhere. People voted for MLAs and same MLA are in assembly, apart from 9 which speaker suspended.

&gt; But it is very much clear to anyone with any sort intelligence that such defection don't happen without large sum of money involved.

Yes I agree with you. That is why it is worrisome that there is a alleged tape recording of Congress CM Harish Rawat engaged in horse-trading, and it is great that UK government is now dismissed, so the charges can be investigated. 

&gt;There is a good probability that Modi may die before 2019.

Wouldn't that be great for Modi-haters? :) They have been praying for that from more than a decade. But Allah seems to love Modi for some reason. Modi seems to be healthy and happy. Sonia Gandhi on the other hand, is already suffering from cancer. All of the BJP will be praying for her long life, since it would ensure that Rahul will remain at the helm of Congress.  And thus Congress will remain away from the government. 

And if Modi dies in an unfortunate attack by misguided people from radical islamist or leftist ideology. It would ensure that Amit Shah would become a PM in the sympathy wave like Rajiv Gandhi.

The CM there is apparently a people's man, he interacts with the community a lot and is seen in a good light by the people in his cabinet. I also feel it's extremely unprofessional of MLAs to switch sides between the term, if they were unhappy with their leadership, they should've either left and joined another party, or waited till the term ended and then switched. They had all the reason to talk to the media, spread the word about this, but they rather choose to break down the government. It's incredibly shady all this, and the next elections will hold the key. I don't hate Modi, but I don't think BJP has the best intentions in mind.

&gt;* WhenIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into power in 2014, he did so with an ambitious mandate to reboot the economy, stamp out corruption and lure foreign investment by streamlining the countrys convoluted regulatory regime.

&gt;* And it is definitely moving though I agree that the speed is not enough, Parrikar told a press conference here at the Defexpo.

On the top of my head I can give examples of putting the cart before the horse in the case of Aadhar, where the best interests of the people have been sidelined, with the government still not coming up with atleast a promise of a Privacy Law let alone discussing nad charting it and implementing it. 

&gt;
Section 4 of RTI Act lays down ""Obligations of public authorities"", which include publishing of particulars of the organisation, powers and duties of its officials, documents held by it, a directory of officials, monthly remuneration received by its officials, and other details.
&gt;
Section 4(2) of the Act says, ""It shall be the constant endeavor of every public authority to take steps... to provide as much information suo motu to the public at regular intervals through various means of communications, including internet, so that the public have minimum resort to the use of this Act to obtain information."" The government, however, has not been implementing this in true spirit.

Only lays bare the aversion this government has in coming clean to the public it wants itself to see as the one it serves. You want to be the Prime Sevak but you don't want to come clean and provide information to the public lest they call your fallacy out!

But hey, no surprises there because your track record speaks for itself!

You need to have a peaceful mind. Start a little bit of meditation. Even max 5 min just after you get up will do great. 

When in group try not be the first to open your mouth. 

Observe the flow of conversation &amp; see where is the majority going. In group of friends, there is always one bakra &amp; it's always the one who is against the majority. 

If you feel to contribute somethings against majority then do it in a indirect way. Dont ask direct questions. Try to be logical. e.g If you guys are having conversation on ""Is Modi best PM ever"" then bring only facts to the discussion &amp; back it up with valid evidence. Hope you got the point. 


If you can't go with majority then, don't express your opinion if topic is really not that important. Sense the mood of others &amp; try to express in general terms without hurting anyone. 

If things get too heated just mention to everyone to not take anything seriously. Let them know that you are unable to control yourself in some situations. nothing wrong in it. 

Lastly, agree to disagree. Don't argue unnecessarily for the sake of it. If someone proves you wrong, accept it &amp; move on.

&gt; #Lahore attack: India can’t afford a govt that directly or indirectly encourages majority extremism

&gt; *The new BJP narrative of an overly religious/Hindu national identity will be the antithesis of everything the freedom movement had sought to avoid and foreclose.*

&gt; Written by Ujjal Dosanjh | Updated: March 28, 2016 12:08 pm 

&gt; Unfortunately, it could if India and its governments aren’t careful.
And I don’t mean Pakistani terrorists from across the border which unfortunately has been quite common or local Muslims who have only occasionally engaged in it. I actually mean elements of the Hindu population doing to Indians what Pakistani Taliban do quite regularly to their own majority and minority populations in pursuit of a theistic extremist agenda.

&gt; Terrorism is as old as humanity and isn’t about to wither away forever from our earth anytime soon. As our world civilised terror receded as a way of resolving our differences or challenging the status quo. Its presence and extent always denotes a corresponding diminution of civility and humanity. It easily takes hold when narrow dogmas and differences – be they political or religious – trump and degrade our common humanity.
 
&gt; In the last few years Islamist Jihadi terror has been taking its toll in Africa, Asia and Europe. In the Middle East ISIS has been killing Sunnis that disagree with its diabolic interpretation of Quran. They kill Shias, Yazidi Christians and Kurds without any compunction what so ever. They wreak havoc in Turkey too. They have carried out attacks in Spain and Britain and more recently killed and maimed civilians in Paris and Belgium. The New York 9/11, Mumbai 26/11, London 7/05 and scores of others preceded the more recent spate of terror. 

&gt; With all of these attacks, the puritan Jihadists have sought to style themselves as the true inheritors and guardians of all things Muslim. They have tried to frame their onslaught in civilisational terms; them against the West and the rest. With the Mumbai attacks they tried in one fell swoop to cast themselves as the potential ‘liberators’ of Kashmir and the sworn enemies of the Hindus, Jews and the Westerners. Since the whole raison-d’être of the Pakistani state was and is its religious identity, its Madarssaisation and Jihadisation was somewhat inevitable. For that to not have happen, the rulers would have to have been farsighted and vigilant. Instead successive Pakistani regimes have tried to achieve legitimacy by appealing to peoples’ narrow religious sentiments. 

&gt; Thus an almost complete Jihadisation of the society can’t be said to be an altogether unintended or unanticipated development. Though the United States of America assisted and encouraged it, the original Taliban was the creation of Pakistan itself -ultimately proving to be its very own Frankenstein’s monster. Had US not taken a short sighted view of things, had Bush junior not unnecessarily invaded Iraq and had Pakistan not resorted to the proliferation of Madarassas, the modern terror monasteries, the world today would have been a different and much less violent place. 

&gt; The most recent Jihadi terror attack in Lahore is part of the Islamist agenda of complete Jihadisation of an already officially Islamic Pakistani state started by Zia Ul Haq, often encouraged and definitely not stopped by any of his successors. There have been many brutal terror attacks in Pakistan. The last to attract any significant world attention was the Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar peopled by children of the Pakistani military elite. The Peshawar attack had killed and injured scores of students and many teachers. The Lahore attack came on the Easter weekend in a Park at the time full of Christians and others. Once again the Jihadists are telegraphing their ultimate aim of eliminating religious minorities from Pakistan turning it into a monolithic Sunni ghetto in South Asia. The sad irony is the site of the attack Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park had been so named in the memory of the famous poet Muhammed Iqbal who had once written the unofficial national anthem of India – the still beloved and revered “Saare Jahan se achcha Hindustan hamara“. Shortly after writing and singing this memorable song he had been swayed by the forces of religious division to write another song this time praising his Islamic religious identity over his culture of India. He subsequently supported the division of India and creation of Pakistan which subsequently and inevitably became a theistic state. I refer to poet Iqbal not out of any disrespect but to simply point out that often even the ablest and sharpest of minds succumb to narrow, dangerous and inevitably destructive interpretations of identity rather than claiming the larger cultural heritage of their societies as their own. The most recent Indian example of the dangers of narrow identity exclusive of our common country or humanity was the barbarism and violence in Haryana in the name of caste. 


&gt; India is going through a crucial phase where narrow dogmas, religions, castes, regions, languages and whatever else comes easily to the opportunistic politicians in pursuit of narrow political ends is used to divide Indians from each other. ‘Treason’ and ‘patriotism’ are the latest epithets in aid of pure partisan objectives not even remotely connected to or concerned with India’s collective good. Eighty per cent of Indians are Hindus. But vast majority of them and other Indians do not believe India is or should be a Hindu country; it is a country of all people and faiths that call India home. Unfortunately the Hindutva narrative is incessantly being pushed by the Indian state under the BJP as the national narrative. 

&gt; Though the Congress has been guilty of many crimes including pandering based on religion, caste, region and language it never advanced any one religion as the basis of a national narrative. The new BJP narrative of an overly religious/Hindu national identity will be the antithesis of everything the freedom movement had sought to avoid and foreclose. Across the border to the West of India is Pakistan, a monster that India must never be; India mustn’t ever be the Hindu country ISIS dreams for it to be. In Pakistan it is the elements of the majority Sunni population that want to turn it into fascistic Islamic state. In India we have seen the recent deadly violence against rationalists, intellectuals and just simple Akhlaqs. 

&gt; The perpetrators have been known to be from the religious majority community. Some believe Abhinav Bharat’s hand may have been behind the Samjhauta Express blasts. Is it then too far-fetched for anyone to be afraid of some from the majority faith turning into Taliban style marauding terrorists? Could what happened in Gulshan-e-Iqbal in Lahore happen in India? One can’t categorically dismiss these fears. The BJP mustn’t allow India’s rich religious diversity to become its weakness. The BJP can’t be oblivious to the dangers of the narrow narrative and path of pushing Hindutva it has chosen under Modi. India can’t afford a government that directly or indirectly encourages majority extremism or turns a blind eye to it. If BJP is even remotely blind to the dangers of where it is leading India with its Hindutva narrative it doesn’t deserve to continue to govern India; not for a nanosecond more. For the sake of India the only option BJP government has is to change course or resign! ",2016-03-29 09:26:30

&gt;* Even at LIGO Science collaboration, we were a little skeptical because what we were trying to measure was really tiny and there are always the chances of it not working well.

&gt;* In scientific terms, we knew we would be able to make our first discovery soon, but I think it came a little sooner than anyone expected and that was exciting!

&gt;* In terms of age, I don't know if I should call myself lucky, but I have almost always been the youngest at a lot of things.

&gt;* And I was 23 when I started my PhD and I was doing what younger people do as opposed to my other colleagues (which is to go out and get sloshed occasionally), so it was a little difficult to fit into this older group at the beginning.

&gt;* Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments qualify as genuine reformpolicies such as dismantling the licence-permit-quota Raj, divestment of public sector units (PSUs), loosening controls on foreign trade and investment, and so forth.

&gt;* It is often asserted that these second-generation reforms are of factor marketsland, labour and capitalalong with continued divestment of PSUs, rationalization or elimination of remaining distorting subsidies, paring back of large social welfare schemes, and so forth.

&gt;* Chagrined perhaps that their idol turned out to have feet of clay, even if this was based on misunderstanding him, they have now pivoted to claiming that there is almost no reform happeningand you can bet that this note will be sounded loudly and repeatedly from now until 2019.

&gt;* They also discount the reality that Modi is a supremely successful politician, who never lost an election he contested as chief minister, and who defied all odds to lead his party to an overwhelming electoral victory in 2014.

&gt;* Great to see the guidelines around 100% FDI in ecomm marketplaces.

&gt;* Glad the govt recognises and supports an industry transforming India!

&gt;* Companies like Flipkart and Snapdeal can now be owned entirely by foreign firms, the government has decided by formally allowing 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment or FDI for e-commerce retailers which are a ""marketplace"" or aggregate products from different manufacturers and sell them to customers.The new sanction does not apply to e-commerce sites that own the products they sell.Global giants Amazon and EBay currently own and run online marketplaces in India without local partners while home-sprung majors like Flipkart have raised billions of dollars from foreign investors.So what the new policies offer is clarity - and considerable comfort - for e-commerce after brick-and-mortar retailers - or traditional shopkeepers- have in court accused online retailers of violating foreign investment rules.Snapdeal founder Kunal Bahl was all thumbs-up for the new move.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to make business easier and draw more foreign investment for the rapidly growing ecommerce space in India, whose surge is led by the ubiquitous mobile phone.Despite concerns that industry valuations may have gotten ahead of present reality, with a Morgan Stanley fund writing down its Flipkart stake by more than a quarter, the lure (of India) is a $25 billion market growing at up to 40 percent annually that's still considered virgin territory.

&gt;* A historic rate of first-time smartphone usage and under-developed logistics and payments render the industry ripe for investment, the Washington Post reported today.

&gt; * The problem with this response, though, is that it doesnt answer the questions that fly in close formation behind the What about 1984? question, namely, Why is the BJP worse than the Congress? and, relatedly, Why is Narendra Modi any worse than Rajiv Gandhi? specially given the latters infamous comment, When a big tree falls, the earth shakes, which seemed, retrospectively, to rationalize the systematic killing of Sikhs in the days that followed Indira Gandhis assassination.

&gt; * But the scale on which Sikhs were killed, the participation of Congressmen at every level, the total complicity of the police and the fact that the butchery happened in the countrys capital, in Delhi, made 1984 a watershed in the history of the republic.

&gt; * In this context, we should remember the way in which Rajiv Gandhis Congress exploited the Delhi pogrom by running a fear-mongering election campaign that suggested that 1984 was a feature not a bug.

&gt; * Let us return to our question, namely, What makes Modi and the BJP worse than the Congress and its dynasts, given the horror of 1984? The answer is simple and unedifying.

... From FB ...

MOHAN GURUSWAMY:
Economy: Time to get Real?

To claim that things are getting better in their tenure and because of them is an old Prime Ministerial habit. A PM is undoubtedly a very important person in our dispensation. The office is vested with great authority and there is an aura about the incumbent that often fools even the cameras whose lights seem to caress rather than expose the object of their focus. Our system of government, with so much power of patronage concentrated in one person, ensures that mostly fawning and obsequious people who constantly whip up a lather of simulated adulation surround the Prime Minister. PM’s consequently confuse the power of patronage with the power that ensures compliance. It is small wonder when our supreme leaders start thinking of themselves as King Canute’s who can order the waves about.

The reality is that like the ocean’s waves, economic waves too are cosmically controlled and PM’s are like King Canute’s who futilely wave their hands about. Happily most PM’s realize this and make sure they are seen waving their hands appropriately with the tides of growth and the ebbs of inflation. But once in a while we get a leader who actually believes that the waves are obeying him. That is when we enter dangerous waters.

I recently attended an event that Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed. Unlike most other PM’s he came promptly at almost the appointed minute and walked briskly to his place on the dais with his characteristic wrestler’s swagger. He listened as the host, an Englishman with a wry sense of humor, exclaimed how fortunate India is to be united as never before under one charismatic and bearded man. The Prime Minister looked on expectantly and the audience was suitably primed to roar its approval, when the host added, sotto voce, Virat Kohli. Mr. Modi wanly smiled at the denouement.

The Prime Minister then spoke and without much ado took the fight straight to the critics, a few of who like me were seated in the front row. He said: “For India to be at the top of the growth tables is an unusual situation. Obviously, there are some who find that difficult to digest and come up with imaginative and fanciful ideas to belittle that achievement.” This is unfair. But it is churlish to say that his critics do so because his government is getting tough on businesses with huge NPA’s. To be truthful based on facts as perceived does not mean a person takes pride in belittling one’s own country? Is the next litmus test of patriotism going to be supporting the PM’s extravagant flights of fancy?

The Prime Minister’s case is that “India’s economic success is the hard-won result of prudence, sound policy and effective management.” He repeated: “India’s growth rate is acknowledged as the highest among major economies.” With evident sarcasm he added that his critics are confused when they say, “the growth rate does not feel right” and generously offered to alleviate the confusion with “facts in place of feelings.” The point here is no critic of any consequence ever argued that the growth rate “does not feel right.” They have just said that his government’s interpretation of the facts is not right.

Take GDP growth for instance. Few argue that the “real’ GDP growth is 7.4%, as his government is claiming though there have been serious misgivings on how the GDP calculations were tweaked to jump growth a further 2.2%. The problem here is the use of the term “real.” In the real world the number that matters is the “nominal” GDP growth rate, which is a measure of current market prices.

For much of the past decade India’s nominal GDP growth was in the 10-15% range and corporate profitability growth was also in that range. Since inflation used to be in the 4-8% range, real GDP was in the 6-9% range. The present nominal GDP growth is 5.2% and instead of inflation we have a deflation of 2.2% giving a real GDP growth of 7.4%.

But the popular mood is determined by actual accruals and not by economic sleight of hand. In the real world it is the nominal GDP that matters. Corporate sales and profitability are calculated in nominal terms. Everyday commerce and business takes place in nominal terms. Government revenues are collected in nominal terms and levied on nominal incomes or sales. It is not a matter of feeling but the reality of life.

The fact is that 2015-16 has been a bad year for the Indian economy. In the budget for 2015-16 the government set a nominal GDP growth target of 11.5%. The nominal GDP growth turned out to be just 5.2%, or 6.3% below target. The real GDP growth of 7.4% is because of the collapse of world commodity prices and has little to do with the so-called “prudent policies.” Comparing apples with oranges can only fool some people for some of the time, and not all the people for all the time.

While on apples and oranges, food inflation is the inflation that matters to most people in this country where the average family expends over 60% of its income on food. This inflation has been well over 25%. The WPI that that government favors has been in the negative zone because of a huge fall in commodity prices. The prices of oil, steel, cement, engineering goods and many other items that mostly comprise the WPI basket have been falling. The global economy is suffering from a surfeit of overproduction and excess capacity.

In his unspooling of statistics the PM made a particular mention of a ‘smart pick up of credit.” He gave a figure of a pick up by 11.5% in February. Its still March now and it is unusual to get data out that fast. But then a PM can always get the data he wants? The fact is that for the last year credit off take growth for manufacturing has fallen from 21% to 7.1%; construction from 27.4% to 4.1%; mining from 17.1% to a negative 8.2%; industries from 9.6% to 5.2%. Only electricity credit off take has just about held course by dropping from 13.7% to 12.7%. Maybe February 2016 is the point of inflection. But shouldn’t we wait a bit to see if a trend is in the making?

The PM referred to a smart upturn in FDI and mentioned a figure of $42 billion for the year 2015-16. It might be so. But Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a respected Washington DC based think-tank estimated that last year Indian illicit outflows amounted to $83 billion. Last year Indian entities also officially invested $18 billion overseas as FDI. So how and where does this leave us?

In his speech the PM also specifically referred to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. The MUDRA (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency) CEO Jiji Mammen claims it has disbursed 3.22 crore loans amounting to Rs.1.22 lakh crores. The PM then makes the rather far-fetched assumption that every such loan would have created at least one job each. Thus he gets an astounding figure of 32 million jobs created by just MUDRA alone. One is tempted to dismiss this as just fanciful claims, but in these times when ones patriotism and professional integrity is apt to challenged for lesser lese majeste, it will be prudent to just say: “Aap key muh mein ghee aur shakkar!” But it is time to get real too.",2016-03-31 08:20:55

&gt; * ""The high-level engagements between our two countries since May of 2014 include six at the leader-level, including the Nuclear Security Summit this week, and we could well see more before the end of the administration,"" US Assistant Secretary of State Nisha Desai Biswal said in a note that outlined US policies and priorities for 2016 in South and Central Asia.She said, ""Much of the focus has been on the economic partnership, and while there continue to be challenges, we have seen a dramatic rise in US investment in India, which today outpaces US investment in China.

&gt; * ""The biggest factor is of course India, and the economic resurgence that is underway there,"" Biswal said.According to the US-India Business Council , nearly 30 American companies have invested over $15 billion in the past year and a half, with over 50 US firms expected to ink more than $27 billion worth of deals over the next year.According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, America's direct investments in India were estimated at about $28 billion in 2014.

&gt; * As per India's official statistics, the cumulative FDI inflows from the US from April 2000 to September 2014 amounted to about $13.19 billion, accounting for nearly 6 per cent of the total FDI into India, making US the sixth largest source of foreign direct investment into India.During Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US in September 2014, an India-US Investment initiative was decided, with a special focus on facilitating FDI, portfolio investment, capital market development and financing of infrastructure and a US-India Infrastructure Collaboration Platform to deploy cutting edge US technologies to meet India's infrastructure needs.However, the note indicates that America's focus for India is not just on economic relations.Highlighting emerging bilateral partnership in the sphere of maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region amid China's growing aggression, Biswal said the US is engaged in unprecedented cooperation with India, the region's largest maritime power.

&gt; * ""India, a regional power that is committed to advancing the rules-based international order, has therefore become a key player and an important partner in advancing maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region, according to Biswal.India's defence trade with the US has increased substantially from a mere $300 million just over a decade ago to close to $14 billion.

&gt; * WASHINGTON: The chief executive of Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) Westinghouse Electric said on Wednesday he expects to sign a deal in June to build six nuclear reactors in India after marathon negotiations that began more than a decade ago.In January, Westinghouse CEO Daniel Roderick told Reuters he hoped to be able to sign the deal in March, in time for a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend a nuclear security summit that starts Thursday.

&gt; * ""It may take until, I'm going to say, early June, which is the next time that there's going to be a government-to-government meeting with India,"" Roderick told Reuters in Washington.The deal would be the first nuclear commercial power project since the United States and India agreed in 2008 to cooperate in the civil nuclear arena.

&gt; * ""We have submitted everything that we need to India and they have reviewed it and they are in the process now of finalising the paperwork,"" Roderick said.He declined to say how much the deal would be worth, or the price per unit of electricity, but said India had judged Westinghouse to be a ""competitive energy source provider"" and this would allow the contract to go on to the next phase.Roderick said Westinghouse was still working on details of the nuclear operator liability issue, but that progress had been made.

&gt; * ""We are certainly comfortable enough to go to the next step from where we are right now, and if India continues to deliver on its milestones for the insurance programme, then that should satisfy what Westinghouse needs,"" he said.India wants to dramatically increase its nuclear capacity to 63,000 megawatts (MW) by 2032, from 5,780 MW, as part of a broader push to move away from fossil fuels, cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the dangerous effects of climate change.For decades, India was shut out of nuclear trade because of its weapons programme.

368,"Netaji survived 1945 air crash, hint newly declassified files

---

&gt;* HYDERABAD: Although successive governments in India since Independence had refused to categorically assert that Subhas Chandra Bose had survived the air crash in Taipei, then known as Formosa, there is enough evidence in the files declassified by the Modi government on Tuesday to point out that Netaji may well have lived beyond 1945.One particular file refers to three broadcasts made by Netaji, which came much after the crash on August 18, 1945.The content of these broadcasts are contained in File No 870/11/p/16/92/Pol from the Prime Minister's Office.

&gt;* A note was placed before Casey.The first broadcast was on December 26, 1945 in which Subhas Chandra Bose said: ""I am at present under the shelter of great World powers.

&gt;* The PM of England is going to send Mr Pethick Lawrence and two other members with no object in view other than let the British imperialism a permanent settlement by all means to suck the blood of India.

&gt;* ""The file also refers to the matter of Netaji allegedly dying in an air crash being taken up by the British government on October 25, 1945 with the PM of UK chairing the meet to consider, among other things, what to do with Bose in the post-war situation.

&gt;* The British cabinet also discussed a confidential note sent by the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, regarding finalisation of a policy towards Bose'.The file also mentions that Lord Mountbatten's diary indicates that he received a despatch from the British directorate of military intelligence after the news of Bose's death in the air crash was broadcast.Mountbatten was then the supreme commander of the Allied forces in SE Asia.

Issues are related to each other. If we fix the digital divide, we can substantially help that out. Online marketplace or something of that sort which gives farmers really good access to a large range of merchants/companies.

&gt;The people who will be supposed to beat those middle men would rather take hafta from the middle-men than beating them up, just like a traffic constable does.

I read an article on /r/Futurology of having some sort of program that decides on whether employees should be fired or not. We need to do the same in India. Technology can solve a LOT of our problems. Electronics are inexpensive than ever.

It will as long as we don't implement technology. It can be easy if we have real solutions...

&gt;* Therefore, the threat of communal fascism we are faced with today, there is an attack being launched on universities, because like Hitler, Modi ji doesn't have support from intellectuals in India.

&gt;* Delhi Police, whose paramount duty was to upkeep law and order situation and protect innocent lives, gave full help to rioters who were in fact working under able guidance of sycophant leaders like Jagdish Tytler and HKL Bhagat.

&gt;* It is a known fact that many jails, sub-jails and lock-ups were opened for three days and prisoners, for the most part hardened criminals, were provided fullest provisions, means and instruction to ""teach the Sikhs a lesson"".

---

&gt; * WASHINGTON: India and the US today signed an MoU for establishing Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India that will play significant role in carrying forward frontline research on various aspects of gravitational wave astronomy.The MoU comes about a month after the Union Cabinet approved the construction of the long-awaited third LIGO interferometer.Department of Atomic Energy Secretary Sekhar Basu and the US' National Science Foundation (NSF) France Cordova signed the MoU in this regard in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and LIGO scientists here.The construction of the long-awaited third LIGO interferometer, expected to be functional by 2023, will significantly improve the ability of scientists to pinpoint the sources of gravitational waves and analyse the signals.Modi, who is currently in the US to attend the two-day Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) met scientists of LIGO who recently proved gravitational waves theory.

&gt; * He also interacted with the Indian student scientists part of the LIGO project.Gravitational waves -- ripples in the fabric of space and time produced by dramatic events in the universe , such as merging black holes, and predicted as a consequence of Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity -- carry information about their origins and about the nature of gravity that cannot otherwise be obtained.With their first direct detection, announced on February 11, scientists opened a new window onto the cosmos.The twin LIGO Observatories at Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, are funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and were conceived, built, and are operated by Caltech and MIT.Advanced LIGO -- a major upgrade to the sensitivity of the instruments compared to the first generation LIGO detectors -- began scientific operations in September 2015.LIGO will provide Indian researchers with the components and training to build and run the new Advanced LIGO detector, which will then be operated by the Indian team, the press statement said.In a statement, the Union cabinet had said ""LIGO-India will also bring considerable opportunities in cutting edge technology for the Indian industry"" which will be responsible for the construction of the new observatory's 4-kilometer-long beam tubes.In addition, the Cabinet statement said ""The project will motivate Indian students and young scientists to explore newer frontiers of knowledge, and will add further impetus to scientific research in the country.

&gt; * ""Indian scientists at Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT) Indore have designed a special testing/prototype facility for receiving Advanced LIGO parts; have been training the teams that will install and commission the detector; and are currently cross-checking the IPR vacuum-system drawings against the Advanced LIGO detector drawings, to ensure a good fit and rapid installation for the third Advanced LIGO detector.In addition to leading the site-selection process, the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) scientists have been setting up a computing center for current and future data.

&gt; * This preparation should make it possible for India to carry the project forward rapidly, it noted.

They cut down UGC budget by nearly half. They're doing the same thing to universities that the previous governments did to public schools.

If you ask your parents, they'll tell you that there was a time when KVs and DAVs were respected schools with high standards.

Then the government fucked that up to favor private schools. Today, you wouldn't send your kids to KVs unless it was absolutely necessary.

The same seems to be happening to public universities. 

First, they cut the funding in half. Then they cut research funding. Then they start off attacks on elite universities.

My girlfriend is a teacher; plenty of her colleagues have got fed up and joined private universities like Sharda and Ashoka.

The comment is not talking about whether the Mundra port is a phenomenal infrastructure project or an industrial marvel. The comment merely points out that the land was acquired in the face of protest which no media house or political entity bothered to address. 

The question is not whether we need ""development"", the question is whether we achieve industrial development by abusing our fellow citizens.

&gt; * WASHINGTON: The United States and Saudi Arabia joined hands on Thursday to sanction Pakistani individuals and terrorist entities, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), hours ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Riyadh.In an unprecedented move, the US treasury department announced that Washington and Riyadh jointly taken action to disrupt the fundraising and support networks of al-Qaida, the Taliban, and Lashkar-e-Taiba(LeT) by imposing sanctions on four individuals and two organizations with ties across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.

&gt; * ""Among the individuals sanctioned are LeT operatives Naveed Qamar, Abdul Aziz Nuristani, and Mohammed Ejaz Safarash, the last of whom the treasury department said bankrolled Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi, who India says was one of the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack planners.The announcement comes as a huge embarrassment for Pakistan, which is already under the gun for its dodgy nuclear weapons policy that is putting mini-nukes in the hands of field commanders, allowing the possibility of a battlefield heist by terrorists and rogue commanders.

&gt; * In providing details about Naveed Qamar, an influential LeT leader who headed its student wing, periodical departments and also edited its Al Dawa magazine, Washington says in early 2013, Qamar led a group of Pakistani businessmen to an LeT training camp for an orientation program on LeT's operations, after which they donated and pledged support of the group.

&gt; * In 2010, Qamar also organized and attended meetings with businessmen from Karachi, Pakistan, in order to collect funds and appeal for donations for LeT militant operations.

&gt; * Yet, despite the Washington Post using the term anarchy to describe the country and respected political experts such as Tim King declaring Belgium to be Europes latest failed state (bringing back not-so-distant memories of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia in the past two decades), Belgian and European authorities did not grant election observer status to any neutral bodies from China, India, the African Union, or Mercosur, only those from the OSCE, staffed by the establishment elite of the European states themselves.

---

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Aadhaar enrolments are set to hit the 1-billion mark by this weekend  a landmark achievement that could pave the way for the rollout of the Modi government's ambitious plan to expand the use of unique identification numbers to deliver subsidies and entitlements.Equipped with statutory backing for Aadhaar after the new law was notified on March 26, the 1-billion milestone will encourage the Centre to universalize UID usage for beneficiaries of welfare schemes which cost an estimated Rs 3.50 lakh crore a year.The scheme to capture the biometrics of all Indian 'residents', launched with the setting up of the UID Authority in January 2009, has the potential of saving between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 70,000 crore a year by reducing duplication and leakages, official sources said.Aadhaar's success is expected to bolster the government's case in the Supreme Court, which has restricted the use of UID to schemes such as MGNREGA, pension disbursal, and Jan Dhan Yojana along with PDS and LPG (cooking gas) distribution.

&gt; * Aadhaar-linked bank accounts are expected to ensure that benefits reach people on confirmation of their identity through the UID authentication system that gives a simple ""yes-no"" response to a query.Use of Aadhaar as a know-your-customer (KYC) verification is likely to make opening of bank accounts, particularly for the poor, much easier.

&gt; * The milestone will accelerate the Centre's financial inclusion schemes envisaged as the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity by bringing welfare programmes on the UID platform much before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The target is to enrol all eligible residents  1.1billion  by 2016-end, paving the way to bring all welfare schemes under the Aadhaar platform.

While modi and mamata have a bonhomie and an *understanding* of sorts, the state BJP cadres harp on about issues that 90% of the electorate doesn't give a shit about - like anti-muslim FUD, illegal immigration and other divisive nonsense that failed spectacularly in even Bihar.

It's actually kinda hilarious how WB state BJP whines about Modi and Jaitley not doing enough to condemn Mamata. The disconnect is quite entertaining.

Now they're trying to get behind the joker Chandan Bose, who is utterly irrelevant. AFAIK they still don't have a good CM candidate, or whoever he is will be unknown to just about everybody.

The center was always more worried about Rajya Sabha support from parties like the TMC, or at the very least less resistance or abstain votes. Strong arming the TMC and then suddenly going lenient on them is clearly evidenced in how the whole Sharada scam was dealt with. In many ways Jayalalitha in TN was brought into the fold in a similar way.

People think Mamata Banerjee is some kind of hot-headed idiot, but she's actually an extremely machiavellian, authoritarian and shrewd political opportunist. She's perfected the art of having the opposition fight amongst themselves, solidified vote banks and utilized the thug-based political cadres to the fullest. All the while keeping herself almost completely clean and on the face of it living a rather simple day to day life. Even her corruption is almost impossible to persecute, it's not blatant like Jayalalitha or Jyoti Basu - she gets money for her artwork, which is just incredibly subjective and any price tag is technically okay. She learnt to not repeat the mistakes of the scotch communists.

If the municipal elections are any indication, TMC is in for another resounding victory. Congress and CPM will be bickering over seat sharing and BJP will prove a nuisance for them - and at best an annoying gnat for the TMC. The desperate FUD-mongering by saffronized or wannabe marwari-fied bengalis, the bitter bengalis that had to leave WB (NRIs or just for other states) who blame the left for everything; the BS about the durga puja ban, the malda ""omg caliphate coming"" nonsense and the idiotic rhetoric about Netaji or illegal immigrants who 90% of the electorate don't give a shit about. Really shows how clueless and irrelevant they are.

Lalu Yadav naturally capitalized on this and turned it into a personal affront to the entire community. The whole thing is quite amusing, explained in these articles : [thewire](http://thewire.in/2015/11/05/after-bjps-third-offending-election-message-ec-pulls-the-plug-on-hate-ads-in-bihar-14802/),  [scroll](http://scroll.in/article/767109/how-the-bjp-went-from-selling-development-as-a-holy-cow-to-banking-on-the-cow-being-holy) and [huffington post](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/11/08/bjp-bihar-election_n_8503356.html) and [indian express](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/lalu-prasad-challenges-pm-narendra-modi-to-prove-he-made-shaitan-comment/)

Looks like yet another self goal.

This is becoming a habit with the BJP - a total inability to censure or prevent far-right morons and bigmouths with foot-in-mouth disease. The chances of getting a reasonable center-right party in India like the British conservatives or Merkel's Christian Democrats is virtually nil. This just emboldens extremists and eventually the Indian public gets fed up and sees through the bullshit charade.

Instead of trying to dispel the ""brahmin-baniya"" moniker, we have people talking about how [traders are braver than jawans](http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/pm-modi-fresh-controversy-says-traders-braver-even-army-jawans/39552).

NewsX, Times Now and Zee lead the charge of the idiot brigade. And of course there's always the trusty FUD army on social media to bury any meaningful news.

463,"&gt;Bengali version of hindutva to flourish.

Very unlikely to happen. Political hinduism is dominated by the Sangh, which in turn is dominated by a very specific kind of Hinduism practiced by a specific kind of community. This is a big problem in India - there simply isn't any Hindu left or center. Congress always ignored religion and the far-right elements of the Sangh completely dominated this vacuum.

Look at how despicably the Sangh tries to bury Rabindranath Tagore's legacy, or how people like Vivekananda are misquoted to fit their agenda. Look at how they try to stifle Kali Puja and try to replace it with very subtle Diwali propaganda, or how marwarification generally happens. Same with Holi vs *Dol*.

Good Hindu groups, reformists or people carrying on the *actual* legacy of 19th and early 20th century Bengali reformers want to keep as far away from politics as possible. Look at RamKrishna mission for example.

&gt;What i have noticed is the fear mongering and the FUD you mentioned is mostly orchestrated by the central BJP. Check their twitter handles and check handles of Babul Supriyo or Chandan Mitra.

I don't know about that. Usually it is the Sangh that does this sort of thing. The central BJP under Modi and Jaitley are actually quite friendly with Mamata.

I totally agree about TMC/CPM thugs. Yes they definitely are an integral part of the mobocracy and goondaism in Bengal. CPM pioneered it, TMC is carrying on that legacy.

On the problem of immigration and islamism I think this is a largely national level problem. Basically what is happening is Sheikh Hasina is clamp down very very hard on the Islamist sympathizing BNP (khaleda zia's party), in conjunction with RAW.

There are frequent economic migrants from Bangladesh into India, but along with them there are people either fleeing persecution by BNP, or even BNP extremists themselves who are trying to escape the mostly legitimate repression they face. The India-BD is almost impossible to manage, so they set up shop in India, make bombs or organize terrorism to carry out back in Bangladesh.

This is a serious problem and both India and Bangladesh should sort it out, along with the BSF. Hardline and radical wahabi Islamism itself is a major problem that needs to be looked at - and much of it has to do with Saudi funding, or the Bangladesh pickle I just mentioned. The trouble is, whenever the Sangh talks about this, their very sinister neo-fascist agenda is always waiting in the shadows.

Even with something like UCC or triple talaq - they care precious little about the welfare of muslims.

&gt;there always be Hindustani values being forced by BJP.

Yep, this is really annoying. Even many maharashtrians are fed up with this sort of thing - pandering to the veggie fundies who want to make gated communities and kick out marathis. Of course they take it a bit too far.

&gt;* Narendra Modis much hyped Chai pe Charcha may have achieved less than it sought to, but it did succeed in putting the spotlight on the Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), a group of young graduates from institutions such as the IITs and the IIMs who organised the programmes on his behalf.

&gt;* In prose that speaks for itself, the informs us: June 2013 it was when a group of few individuals consisting of a fresh Graduate, a Lawyer, an Entrepreneur, a Software Engineer and two investment bankers began to discuss the nations current state at a restaurants coffee table.

&gt;* Under the banner Who We Are?where the unnecessary question mark perhaps suggests an unconscious compromise between the straightforward who we are and the existential who are we?the profiles of 85 young professionals who form the core of this organisation have been put up.

&gt;* This predomination of technicians, to use the word in its old sense of a person well-versed in the techniques of engineering, management, law or commerce, seems representative of a large number of those who have lent their support to the Modi campaign.

&gt;* When Modi, very rarely in this campaign, was forced to respond to a question on values, as he had to in his interview to Arnab Goswami, when they discussed the issue of India being a natural home for Hindus anywhere in the world, he answered it the only way he could, as an RSS man.

483,"Indian right-wingers are usually the first people to trash on those with humanities degrees. Remember the response to the letter signed by several Indian university professors, condemning Modi? More criticism was directed to their area of study than the content of the letter. If anything, this thread shows the skewed, bi-polar mind of the average Indian right-winger.",2016-04-03 12:16:27

487,I think all this hyper-nationalism is all an elaborate ruse. This is a non issue and they are trying to divert attention from something else or all things else. It's not like we are going great guns economy wise. Frankly I do not see too much of a difference from the UPA and no reason to vote for Modi again.,2016-04-03 14:30:11

491,"FOB = fresh off the boat.

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fob

tldr is 1st gen immigrants that generally live in a sort of ghettoised bubble, cling on to their roots and dislike assimilating. Usually they are quite nostalgic about their motherland, patriotic and in a lot of ways socially conservative. Often suffering from a victimhood complex, always seeing everyone around them as racist. FOBs frequently tend to be massive modi fans, especially those that are interested in Indian politics.

Yes obviously this is a generalization and there will be numerous exceptions.

There are similar terms like ""ABCD"" too to describe mostly 2nd gen immigrants in America.

There's a TV show about asian fobs, in fact it's titled ""Fresh off the boat"". Kinda funny but a bit too safe and smug for me.

You really should check out [""I am Offended"" starring many stellar desi standup comedians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swozBbWMzNQ)

Oh and, goodness gracious me or Russel Peters.",2016-04-03 17:13:19
