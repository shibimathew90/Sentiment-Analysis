3,"Great move. I admire Modi. He is an amazing strategist. I personally have been thinking about this since long. Cheques are a useless payment instrument nowadays. The only purpose cheques have served me in the last 10 years is for KYC. Can't recall when I last issued a cheque to pay. 

India has a bright future with NaMo at the helm.",2017-11-18 01:46:50
4,"We did something like ""Demonetisation"" what western countries couldn't do and we have most successfully taken our country to different heights according to Modiji. Please believe him, he won't follow western ideologies. He will bring desi plans of net neutrality. Long live our leader Modiji. Hail NaMo. ",2017-11-21 19:06:08

15,"Years of dog trained mediocrity. The person on the other side of the desk has learned to mindlessly ask for cards - ration, PAN, DL, I-Card, etc etc. For a person who doesn't understand the working of Aadhar - which even many educated and intelligent people don't, the default form factor for Aadhar is ""card"". 

The fact that the governments (both NaMo and MMS) have done zero work to explain Aadhar to common people is the biggest sin behind so much confusion. I remember watching promos upon promos of must smaller govt schemes like Trysem, Dwakra, etc as a kid. Nothing of that sort has been done for Aadhaar. ",2017-12-02 20:34:06
16,"&gt; Another obsession is with the military. Nobody gives a shit that you can list out all the Indian military ranks or the specs for Tejas. In fact most of the world doesn't give a shit about Tejas, many countries made their own planes 70-80 years ago.

You literally wrote what I always had in my mind regarding these army related queries, threads and comments on social media. Fuck, Indian Army fanboyism is super cancerous. Even I am proud of it but please stop slapping it on my face and others. 

Even a word against army will invite the wrath of these inbreds on every media, to the point of sexual harassment, doxxing and the usual ‚Äúmadarchod bhenchod, commie, libraandu, Paki‚Äù. 


There is this reaction style video on YT where of a western guy watching defense force parade during Republic Day. His face had this happy expression and the look of absolute awe regarding the perfect timing and power show. In between, he made this comment- ‚Äúwho are these people and why are they focusing camera on them repeatedly ??‚Äù. You can guess what the comment section was like - ‚Äúmadarchod give him respect. He is honourable PM Shri NaMo‚Äù ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

20,"True. But I think NaMo is quite vary of MMS's comments. He more often than not speaks on all his attacks by the ex PM at least. Even a couple of times in the Lok Sabha (or was it Rajya Sabha, about the raincoat statement).",2017-12-11 21:51:06
