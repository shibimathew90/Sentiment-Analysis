* Whatever the challenges between LG, center and state, Kejriwal needs to quit whining. Did he expect that after a crushing defeat, BJP will let him slide by. Off-course they are going to provoke him and block him at every turn but he needs to figure out a way to work through the challenges. Don't other state governments work with Center cordially ?

* Really needs to tone down his rhetoric and confrontational attitude. Lets be real, no matter how honest and noble you are, you need to learn to make compromises and use some diplomacy and smooth talk to get work done. This is true even in corporate world. Kerjiwal can't piss on Modi everyday and then expect Center to approve his bills. His confrontational attitude is really nauseating and is pushing all his supporters away. 

*  Make friends across party lines. Not everyone is corrupt in BJP and even corrupt people sometimes want to do the right thing, work with them. Push for progress instead petty name calling. 

* AAP started out with such a great idea and I still believe there are good honest people in AAP but Kejriwal needs to side step and let others take lead. 

* Remove non-essential free loaders like Aushotosh who blabber shit on TV and instead let the work do the talking. I think AAP is doing a tremendous job with education and health and they need to increase this charter to clean energy and promotion of solar energy adoption and electric vehicles. I think Kejriwal can easily win back Delhi if AAP can start controlling pollution. 

* Others have mentioned patching up with YY and PB and I agree. Stick to your core principles and have advisers who disagree with you. In that sense, I think both Modi and Kejriwal have surrounded themselves with sycophants.

&gt;* Junior railway minister Manoj Sinha said on Friday afternoon that he wasnt in the race to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, a day before the BJPs pick for the states top job is to be announced.

&gt;* Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, the three-time BJP MP who represents Ghazipur in the Lok Sabha said he didnt know of a race for the CMs position.

&gt;* The BJP won a sweeping victory in Indias largest state with 312 seats in the 403-member house but is scheduled to meet on Saturday to decide on a chief minister.

&gt;* Known as a Bhumihar leader, Sinha was seen as the choice of many lawmakers because of his unassuming style and hard work  praised even by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* He also had deep ties to the Banaras Hindu University that falls within Modis Lok Sabha constituency, having served as the student union president.

---

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modis government is considering easing rules for foreign retailers if they agree to sell more locally produced goods, according to an official with knowledge of the matter.

&gt;* Global companies with a permit to sell local food items -- Amazon.com Inc. is reported to have applied for a license -- may also be allowed to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25 percent of total sales, the official said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media.

&gt;* India may also allow more foreign direct investment in multibrand retail if companies such as Wal-mart Stores Inc. and Carrefour SA agree to stock only local products.

&gt;* Retail is a sensitive subject in India, and tough opposition to slash rules comes from within Modis Bharatiya Janata Party because its traditional support base has been small traders.

&gt;* About 44 percent of Indias $620 billion retail market comprises food and grocery items, said Arvind Singhal, chairman at consultancy firm Technopak Advisors Pvt.

&gt;* Long before India became ideologically polarised and social media spawned  to use Benedict Andersons term  an imagined community, as generous with its plaudits as it is nasty with its jeers, reporting on elections was an exhilarating experience.

&gt;* If the reporters copy depicts the saffron brigade slipping or caught in a tight contest, but the BJP goes on to win handsomely, the reporter will be shamed and accused of letting their secular-liberal or communist ideology blind them.

&gt;* It was the year in which BJP leader LK Advani clambered onto a rath in the hope of mustering support for a Ram mandir in Ayodhya.

&gt;* Before the 2002 Gujarat Assembly elections, the late editor of Outlook magazine, Vinod Mehta, was faced with a dilemma: should he drop an opinion poll predicting a victory for the Congress over the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose campaign Narendra Modi, then the chief minister, was spearheading?

&gt;* The unforgiving sentinel in social media has just one way to judge a journalists objectivity  did the journalist call an election in favour of the BJP, which ultimately won?

&gt; * BJP state unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who is being credited for a large chunk of the OBC votes BJP garnered in these polls, also bowed out of the race as he was given the responsibility to choose the party's pick to lead Uttar Pradesh government.

&gt; * In 2014, riding the Modi wave, Sinha became a third-time parliamentarian, but this time he caught the prime minister's eye, who is himself an organisational man, and came to the limelight as one of many first time ministers in Modi's cabinet.

&gt; * Sinha, according toCNN-News18,is also known to keep in close touch with his constituency, where at least until late last year, he was in the habit of spending his weekends.

44,"If the property was relinquished before Abida Sultan adopted Pakistani citizenship, and had already been transferred to other people by the time Pakistan became an enemy state, then I highly doubt the courts will allow it to happen, regardless of what Khan does. The government will have to prove its' claim in the court, not the other way round. Burden of proof lies on the govt, not on ""poor"" Saifu.

&gt;If this isn't war on the minority by a majority, I don't know what is.

Firstly, tell that to my distant relatives from one branch of my family who stayed behind in Pakistan. They'll laugh in your face and tell you what oppression is really like. By the way, these are the same ones from whom, nobody on our side of the border **will ever** inherit any property.

Secondly, we could just as easily frame your claim from a totally different perspective and call it ""a war on the rich, by the poor"", and breaking up these massive estates would be in line with our 'Socialist' ideals too, and suddenly nobody would have a problem with *that*. Especially if the land was broken up and redistributed among those same 'minorities' you're talking about, or the government built good subsidized housing projects all along those areas for the underprivileged. Right? 

And thirdly, what majority are you talking about? [OBC's and Dalits make up the two biggest votebanks in our whole population, totaling around 70% of the population.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/OBCs-form-41-of-population-Survey/articleshow/2328117.cms) 

Of the one billion Hindus in India, it is estimated that Hindu ""Upper/general"" castes comprise 21%, Other Backward Class comprises 45%, Hindu Scheduled Castes (Dalits) comprises 22% and Hindu Scheduled Tribes comprises 12%. That's among Hindus alone, not as a fraction of the total population, and not including Dalit Muslims, or OBC Muslims. [Out of total population (estimated)](http://www.anindianmuslim.com/2006/06/caste-composition-of-india.html): OBC: 42%, Dalit (SC): 17%, Muslims: 14%, UpperCastes: 12%, ST: 9%, Christians: 3%, Sikhs/Buddhists/Jains/etc: &lt;3%. So, I guess you meant that OBC's are oppressing Muslims? Accurate I suppose, considering Modi is OBC, but nevertheless misleading. Hindus aren't some single group that band together and oppress everyone, unlike what your narrative dictates. The BJP was out of UP for over 15 years precisely *because* the state is a blend of all castes and religions, and the OBC/SC/ST blocs didn't want a party in power that wasn't *heavily* OBC/SC/ST. Muslims **already** outnumber what *they* would consider the ""majority Hindus"".

&gt;The government is running short of money and will stop at nothing to stop spilling any more red ink in its books. They did it so recently by making so thousands of people forfeit their currency notes, writing off crores of liabilities in a single stroke. They did it previously with their ratcheting tax on fuel prices. They did it by introducing a double-tax for cleaning up the country. They added retrospective taxes on multinationals. Now they're doing it to get hold of expensive real estate by playing the same fraud on innocent minorities simply because somebody in their family once decided to immigrate to another country.

I don't care what you think about the other policies, you're free to consider them theft. I consider the Swacch Bharat cess a double-tax too, because we already pay the friggin municipalities. It's dumb. 

&gt;And since we are not officially at war with any country, there's no real definition of the word ""Enemy"" out here. It could mean any foreign country. Kannadigas and Punjabis who have immigrated to North America should beware of this government's intentions because they may soon be at the receiving end of this same treatment.

We're not ""at war"" but Pakistan and China are still extremely hostile neighbors whom we have actively ongoing *SERIOUS* border disputes with. Do you disagree with this? Also, emigration in not the same as accepting citizenship, or giving up Indian citizenship. You can move where you please. If we go to war with that nation, you will request evacuation from your embassy. Whichever country you stay with, the other will seize any assets of yours in their territory. If we go to war with Canada, then it's *obvious* the Punjabi-bros there will need to pick a side, because if they return to India, their Canadian assets are forfeit. Same for if they stay in Canada. Same for Sri-Lanka and Tamilians living in that area, or Nepal and the Buddhist/Pahari Tribes in that area. But obviously, that isn't clear-cut ""Minority"" vs ""Majority"" so that's not part of your argument. This is a simple fact of international disputes. And yes, it is permanent in every other country too. **No government** will lovingly keep those properties ""in trust"" waiting for your peaceful return to gift it back to you as a ""welcome home"" present. It seizes it and sells it to someone else, or builds a hospital/army base/subsidized housing/welfare project/sewage plant/etc over it. 

In fact, having a solid, clear policy on this is *CRUCIAL* to keeping *PEACE*, a fact that you will probably ignore. Several nations have properties/assets in India. Multinational companies, European and American businesses, Japanese companies, etc. And India and several other countries have assets/properties in *those countries, in turn. If any of these countries declare war, all those assets are instantly **forfeit** (forfeit == permanently gone, not ""borrowed""). This is why even with armed skirmishes, many nations actively avoid calling their conflicts a ""war"". To declare war, it means the potential reward of the conflict, exceeds the monetary value of the damage you would do to your own companies, individuals and economy, through the loss of those properties and assets, plus the cost of the war itself. This is one of the biggest reasons US and Saudi remain unlikely allies. Saudis have a massive investment in US markets. If US starts being aggressive towards Saudi, the Saudis will fear their assets are going to be frozen/seized, so they'll dump them on the market, devaluing them immensely and wrecking the US economy. The US will automatically forfeit all bases and claims on Saudi soil, including those fancy Westernized compounds that the Americans live in. Do you see how it keeps the peace? Now in the absence of any clear policy on assets owned by enemies, the enemy keeps pushing the boundaries to see what it can get away with, such as Pakistani adventurism along the border. To be clear, Pakistan is already an enemy state, but once ties normalize and diplomacy resumes, perhaps they would like the opportunity to invest in India once more, which would mean removing the ""enemy"" status. That wouldn't mean that old properties would be returned, but it would allow new ones to be purchased. I believe that China is still allowed to invest financially in India (quite heavily at the moment), although I doubt **buying** land is allowed. Not sure on this.

Anyway, if that doesn't give a different perspective on this matter, I have nothing else. I think the courts will decide fairly on Khan's properties. ",2017-03-18 00:52:01

After his ascension, he has performed brilliantly, first under Suresh Prabhu, then promoted to a MOS with independent charge for telecommunications.

. 

&gt;In January 2007, an altercation occurred amidst a Hindu group and Muslims during a Muharram procession in Gorakhpur which led to the hospitalisation of a young Hindu, Raj Kumar Agrahari. The District Magistrate made it clear that Adityanath should not visit the site as it may inflame tensions. He initially agreed but after Agrahari died, he disobeyed the magistrate and travelled to the site with a group of his followers. Adityanath started a non-violent dharna on the site. However inflammatory speeches were made and some of his followers set fire to a nearby mazar

. 

&gt;Adityanath shared the stage during a hate speech in which an unidentified speaker urged the Hindu audience to dig up the graves of Muslim women and rape the corpses. Recording of this event went viral on social media in March 2015.

. 

&gt;In June 9, 2015, Yogi Adityanath declared that those who oppose SuryaNamaskar, part of Yog, can leave India

. 

&gt;During the intolerance debate in the media, Adityanath compared Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed. He said, “Shah Rukh Khan should remember that majority population of the Country made him the Star, and if they boycot his films, he will also have to wander on streets. It is unfortunate SRK is speaking the same language that of Hafiz Saeed.""

&gt;* As his supporters raised slogans in Lucknow this morning to demand that Yogi Adityanath be made Chief Minister, the lawmaker flew down to New Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and returned to Lucknow on a chartered flight along with the party's UP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya.Sources said the party's ideological mentor, the RSS, vetoed the party's top choice for Chief Minister, union telecom minister Manoj Sinha.

&gt;* BJP President Amit Shah met RSS leaders today to finalise who would be Chief Minister.Yogi Adityanath, who has massive influence in eastern UP, was seen as the most popular leader among the BJP's cadres in the state, sources said.Sources said Uttar Pradesh is also likely to have two deputy chief ministers: Dinesh Sharma, the Lucknow Mayor who has party president Amit Shah's trust, and Keshav Prasad Maurya, the party president in Uttar Pradesh and the BJP's face among the state's most backward castes.

&gt; On Modi's instructions, VHP workers, protesting against Advani's praise of Jinnah in Pakistan, were beaten up by cops. The government also demolished nearly 200 temples in Gandhinagar, which provoked Togadia to call him 'Maulana Modi'.


http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Togadia-Modi-A-tale-of-animosity/articleshow/53693329.cms




&gt; Things changed when Modi won the elections. He immediately dropped Zadaphia from his council of ministers, in a clear signal to Togadia that his interference in governance was no longer required. 





&gt; 
Strangely, while Singhal patched up with Modi, Togadia remains stubbornly opposed to the Sangh's endorsement of the Gujarat chief minister's national ambitions. In recent years, he sparingly visited Gujarat, citing a threat to his life. He ridiculed Modi's ""sadbhavana"" overtures towards Muslims in 2011 and accused him of dumping the Hindutva agenda for the sake of an image make-over. 




http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/History-of-how-Modi-and-Togadia-fell-out/articleshow/34068095.cms




&gt; t is the BJP’s worst kept secret that Narendra Modi and Pravinbhai Togadia today enjoy an ambivalent relationship, to put it mildly. The two were the best of friends at one time, with Togadia boasting in 2002 that: ""Narendrabhai is riding the horse, but the reins are in my hand"".





&gt; VHP supporters who used to flaunt their connections with the state government and used to offer their services to investors in Gujarat for a small fee, found themselves cut out of all government deals. This had Togadia railing against Modi but powerless to do anything about him.




&gt; As Modi’s second term wound down and 2007 assembly elections approached, Togadia said at a press conference that the VHP would not support the BJP in the assembly elections. He also said: “No one should consider himself the most powerful person and ruling over the hearts of the people.” Modi had disturbed a significant interest group. Corruption went down visibly but the VHP became a firm, implacable enemy.





&gt; Modi is more than familiar with the lifestyle of VHP leaders and how it is supported. There was a time during previous BJP regimes that VHP workers’ salaries used to be paid out of Gujarat government funds. All that has stopped.

&gt; * LUCKNOW: It was not after all as smooth an operation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah to pick the new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister as it was in other states like Maharashtra, Haryana, Assam, Goa and Uttarakhand.

&gt; * There were many in the race, some of them the favourites of the two most powerful men in the country.But on Saturday, as the election of the new Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister tossed from one name to another, the final selection proved one of the most surprising -- Yogi Adityanath , who enjoys strong RSS backing and may not have been the first choice of the Modi-Shah duo.Till Friday Union Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha was the frontrunner for the top post in the most populous and politically crucial state of India.He bowed out of the race as other names cropped up and the suave M Tech graduate from the BHU quietly travelled to his parliamentary constituency of Ghazipur.On Saturday morning, he walked to pray in the Kashi Vishwanath, Kaal Bhairav and Sankat Mochan temples in Varanasi.Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh was already out for various reasons, a party insider told IANS.Having served as the last BJP Chief Minister between 2001-2002, Rajnath Singh was dropped for more than one reason - he is not the best known favourite of the Modi-Amit Shah duo, his electoral track record has been abysmal in the past and over all his becoming the Chief Minister would have spiked the chances of his first-term legislator son Pankaj Singh's potential entry into the state government.Sources said Sinha was almost finalised after this until party in-charge of the state, Om Mathur batted strongly for Keshav Prasad Maurya, the BJP UP unit chief who is credited with bringing in the MBC votes for the party in the assembly polls in which the BJP and its allies won 325 of the 403 assembly seats.Maurya, known to be harbouring chief ministerial ambitions, did not take the scheduled flight for Lucknow on Saturday and instead camped at the 66, North Avenue residence of Mathur.Maurya, the man who was till Thursday feeding 'Balaji's prasad laddoos to the BJP's top brass, however, saw his chances diminishing.

&gt; * His supporters, meanwhile, took to the streets in Lucknow, raising slogans favouring Maurya.The Shah-Modi duo are learnt to have conveyed their displeasure ""at this public display of indiscipline and disregard"" after which both Mathur and Maurya left for Lucknow.Five-time Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath, who had gone into a sulk following reports that his name was not being considered, was, meanwhile, flown to New Delhi in a special chartered plane.

&gt; * He drove straight to Shah's bungalow where they were closeted for some time.A decision was taken there, say sources, after consultation with and approval of Modi, who in a few minutes was to fly to Uttarakhand for the swearing in of the new BJP government in the hill state.Leaders privy to the decision said that in many ways both Shah and Modi were ""arm twisted"" into decision making.

He was never a ""riot accused"" he was accused of not doing enough to stop the riots. That charge is something many other CM's, Nehru, Indira and the true genocide monger Rajiv have on them. 

&gt; India was not constructed to be a place of Muslim and Christian appeasement and a land without laws where you can practice sectarian politics

Congress has done that starting with the genocide of Razkars in Hyderabad overseen by Patel and Nehru.

Why choose this arbitrary start point? Because it suits your false narrative?

Why not...The Parsi Muslim riots of 1850 and 57? Why not 1882 Salem Hindu Muslim riots? Why not the Moplah Genocide of Hindus? Nagpur Hindu Muslim riots of 1928?or the 1969 Ahmedabad riots? Why not 1984? Why not Nellie? Why not Bhaglpur?

&gt; Why Yogi as CM of U.P. is a masterstroke by BJP
&gt; 
&gt; Tomorrow, Yogi Adityanath (Ajay Singh) will take oath as the new CM of Uttar Pradesh. While there is no denying the fact that he is regarded as a controversial figure, his selection is not a gamble but a carefully planned strategy. The reasons that I can put forward to support my statement are:
&gt; 
&gt; He is the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini, a social, cultural and nationalist group of youth who seek to provide rightist Hindu platform.
&gt; Adityanath was the youngest member of the 12th Lok Sabha at 26. He has been elected as an MP from Gorakhpur to the Lok Sabha in the 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections.
&gt; He is well educated (B.Sc. in Mathematics) and connected to the ground level politics having support of the masses.
&gt; Currently he is Mahant of Guru Gorakhnath Temple which has millions of followers.
&gt; He is frank in nature, hard-working, bold and decisive, patriotic and works for the development of his people.
&gt; Much of the controversies associated with him are due to the anti-national and anti-Hindu media and his political opponents.
&gt; He is staunch supporter of Hinduism and there is nothing wrong in that. One should be proud of his religion and promote its good teachings.
&gt; Uttar Pradesh needed to do away with minority appeasement, religious riots, and Xtian conversions. Yogi is well suited leader for this.
&gt; Whether Kairana, or other Muslim dominated areas, Hindu exodus was happening since decades without any protest. This had to be stopped to protect rights of Hindus.
&gt; Secularism in India means vote bank politics and hence we see haj subsidy, preferential treatment to Muslims and neglecting the plights of Hindus. Appointment of Yogi as CM will give a strong message against all these.
&gt; Adityanath belongs to Eastern U.P. as an MP and this region is close to Muslim dominated areas of Bihar such as Gopalganj, Siwan, etc. His selection will influence the political map of these areas also.
&gt; U.P. was turned into a wasteland despite its potential and the credit for ruining it goes to parties like Congress, SP and BSP. Hooliganism, stagnant development, corruption had become synonymous with the state. With support of 2 Deputy CM, and under the leadership of Narendra Modi at Centre, Yogi will have a big opportunity to turn the fate of this state.
&gt; Yogi is known for protest against religious conversions, cow slaughter and Love Jihad. To check these menace, BJP needed someone of his caliber.
&gt; During state election campaign, the firebrand leader was the second most sought-after campaigner in the state in the assembly elections after Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
&gt; Not denying the fact that he is loud-mouthed, he has got enough of experience in politics to lead the party in UP from the front.
&gt; Under the reign of Akhilesh Yadav, Hindus were not allowed to worship during Ajaan time, loudspeakers were removed from temples, lands were given at cheap rates to Muslims for graveyards, electricity supply also followed a particular pattern during festivals. Hence, the annoyed Hindus consolidated for the first time and gave a clear mandate to BJP. I will like to point out that one should not have even an iota of opinion that Muslims also voted to the Right-Wing party.
&gt; His appointment is by support of RSS, BJP and Hindu saints with no objection from any other party member. This is strange considering his strained relations with BJP in the past.
&gt; Those who think that Yogi will be his usual self even after becoming the CM are having wrong notion. Just keep watching, development is going to be the prime agenda under his rule. Ram Mandir issue was just a tool for polarization of votes.
&gt; Contrary to popular belief, Hindutva and development are not poles apart, they go hand in hand. One can’t think of development without assurance of life safety.
&gt; At just 44 years of age, he has got enough time to bring about his ideas to work and strengthen the party. There are court cases pending against him but he is still to be proven guilty in any such case. And if anyone thinks that protecting Hinduism is wrong then I approve such wrong-doings.
&gt; To those who are fearing that all hell will break loose on the so called minorities after Yogi becomes CM, I can only say: stop dreaming…there are enough evidences that Adityanath is a honest leader against Casteism, corruption, and has also helped people of his region, regardless of their religious inclination. Though known more for his rightist Hindu politics, it is to his credit that people in Gorakhpur, especially around the temple, hold him in high esteem irrespective of whichever caste or community they belong to. Even Muslims around the temple are given protection by the Yogi.
&gt; 
&gt; His 5 times selection as an MP isn’t a testimony of that?
&gt; 
&gt; And my special advice to presstitutes – Stop maligning Hinduism or else you will get more heart-burns, this is just a trailer. You keep mum on inflammatory speeches of Azam Khan or Owaisi but when a sanyasi who lost his parents at young age and is dedicating his life to the cause of nationalism and Hinduism is a criminal?

I am an ardent BJP supporter especially ever since they started campaigning on the 'developmwnt' agenda. But this appointment has deeply disappointed me.

(Fortunately because he knew Yagnik by name and was to later make some snide comments about his activities and columns.) It was a long, rambling interview, but it left me in no doubt that here was a classic, clinical case of a fascist. I never use the term ‘fascist’ as a term of abuse; to me it is a diagnostic category comprising not only one’s ideological posture but also the personality traits and motivational patterns contextualising the ideology.

Modi, it gives me no pleasure to tell the readers, met virtually all the criteria that psychiatrists, psycho-analysts and psychologists had set up after years of empirical work on the authoritarian personality. He had the same mix of puritanical rigidity, narrowing of emotional life, massive use of the ego defence of projection, denial and fear of his own passions combined with fantasies of violence – all set within the matrix of clear paranoid and obsessive personality traits. I still remember the cool, measured tone in which he elaborated a theory of cosmic conspiracy against India that painted every Muslim as a suspected traitor and a potential terrorist. I came out of the interview shaken and told Yagnik that, for the first time, I had met a textbook case of a fascist and a prospective killer, perhaps even a future mass murderer.""

A lot of voters did vote for him for development, and even though demonetization failed, it showed his willingness to go against a perceived enemy of his voter base. The politicking to pull that off is unimaginable, honestly.

The tide had started to turn for Modi. The liberals and MSM had started to soften massively post the UP victory. He could have chosen to become a statesman. Already media has elevated him to Indira Gandhi level and were beginning to compare him to Nehru. Just the development plank would have got him the 2019 election. Even Muslims had started voting for BJP, if we were to believe the media.

There wasn't a electoral need to choose Yogi. 

Yet. 

So my theory is:

1. He doesn't care that much for the media and the liberal intellectuals perception of him as we think.

2. He doesn't want to repeat Vajpayee's mistake. He wants to keep loyalties of the core BJP vote bank intact. Wants to tell that Hindutva isn't just a Jumla.  

3. Ram mandir is top on the agenda.

4. Yesterday after Yogi's announcement Modi spoke on development for an hour, without batting an eyelid, at India Today conclave. So that focus isn't going away. However Temple and Hindutva are important too, is the message.

Begin by striking at the biggest criticism - hold internal election. It will throw up Rahul Gandhi as the President - he still commands respect among Congress workers but he will have legitimacy.

Then, showcase your development. Draw a line on the past, UPA is over and done. The Congress has a few states left, make them models of development - communicate the development to the people.

Give Captain a free hand, show India how the Congress can turn a state around, especially one which has been ruined because of the tacit/hypocritical support of the BJP.

Finally, start preparing for 2019 now. By now, I mean now. Make a team of leaders, start touring India, talk to people about what they want - development wise. Involve Akhilesh Yadav, Omar Abdullah, along with Shashi Tharoor, maybe, in this too, perhaps.

A lot of people are talking about a Grand Alliance. I think it will be a mistake. Lalu and Mayawati represent a politics that has no national appeal, the Opposition has to reclaim the development narrative from the BJP.

225,"Mandir wahi Banaenge means the ground zero where Babri Masjid existed before it's demolition by RSS/BJP/VHP in 1992,because some nutjob Baba, who couldn't tolerate anymore to see Masjid made by Babur 1000 years ago in Ayodhya.The supposedly place where Lord Ram was ""allegedly"" born.They wanted to build Ram Temple in that same exact place, over the top of demolished Babri Masjid foundation.Narendra Modi was part of the Demolition too as he was RSS kar sevak that time.No, he wasn't selling tea that time.He was the regular hoon with Muslim hate in his inbred brain.

From Advani to Bal Thackeray,Singhal,Bhagwat etc.. they all created hate speeches which led to demolition and Riots all over India.Muslims and Hindus were butchering each over that demolished Masjid, each claiming it is their religious area. The only countries were laughing heartily at our sorry conditions were Pakistan and Bangladesh, further adding more fuels to anger and hate. Innocents died which includes Women,Children,Babies, Older folks etc...over that Area 51 (hypothetical place).

The matter is still in Supreme Court since 1993. It still got no balls to decide to settle the matter in whose favor yet, whether Hindus or Muslims.
Whenever the topic is raised, Hindu outfits like these BJP/RSS tried to provoke this issue whenever they can to polarise and create divide among people.That made them out of power since 1993,in UP and all over India once. That's why that faggoty ass Modi wore Sheep's skin over his Wolf body, and changed the strategy to development, since that would sound more believe if nothing else can.He knows Indians are sucker for 1st world developments,that's why so many NRI's. He knew sell these idiots dreams, and while keeping the Hindutva agenda secret mission.He knew Congress won't let that happen because of it's Secularism stand.Even it is worst, but still the country was somewhat peaceful because of the congress regime
Modi tamed all those Ram Mandir hardliners to keep calm until he convinces everybody that devils don't exist, and only then strike later.

The mission is accomplished, idiotic Indians took the bait, now I hardly think RSS would even wait for a supreme court verdict to do what they'd do in coming years. I sense much more bigger riots in coming years.

I was 15 when this thing happened.Seen people peltng stones at each other, saw many small temples and Durgahs getting blown or demolished.I had not eaten well for a month due to curfews everyday.Cable TV was just introduced back then, but it had just 8 channels and nothing was Indian.So had to rely on Doordarshan news.It showed nothing else but news of bloodshed for 30 minutes and then it was blacked out for the whole day.",2017-03-19 09:56:23

I doubt that happening. Whatever respect that you talk about, I think he is a fool enough for people to realise and not vote for him. 

&gt; The Congress has a few states left, make them models of development - communicate the development to the people. Punjab is especially important for this.

Yeah, development is very important. But I think more important is to build a best-in-class PR team to conduct campaigns and take it to people. People who refrained from Congress a mere 5 years back could now associate themselves if the propaganda goes well. Induct more people in party. Maybe take in some JNU guys(?)

&gt;Finally, start preparing for 2019 now.

Surely do that but certainly thats is a lost cause. 

&gt;There is no better time to do this than now, when Modi has shot himself in the foot with the Yogi fiasco.

Agreed. They killed the goose laying golden(bhagwa?) eggs by putting Yogi as Uttar Pradesh CM, revealing their boiling, vile religions intolerance. Supporters should finally see this happening and refrain from taking part in it. If not, chutia Ram temple is certainly going to be built and riots are going to happen.

&gt; Indian populace is given a propagandized version of the developments.  

The articles being published about India in Chinese state-sponsored media can't be influenced by GoI, can they? What explains their always breathing fire in rude words about India?

&gt; Its common sense exercise, the info is all over the place

[Your first article](http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/who-is-the-biggest-aggressor-in-the-south-china-sea/) leads to an 'access denied' message on clicking the link to the actual testimony, so I won't comment over it (you would agree that this matter is beyond relying on editorial columns instead of actual official documents). [The other one made some interesting unbiased reading](http://thediplomat.com/2016/05/south-china-sea-who-claims-what-in-the-spratlys/) about the multipartite dispute, though it doesn't explain your point about how China is not the aggressor. In fact it accepts that Spratlys lie in Vietnam's EEZ under UNCLOS, and rubbishes your first source itself explicitly. On the other hand, China objects to India's involvement in Vietnamese oil exploration efforts in SCS? Any comments on that?

&gt;Whosoever controls SCS controls East Asia. This is the fundamental geostrategic reality of the region.  

Yep, but the existence of an underlying US ambition doesn't change the geographical reality. US, for one, already had such a huge number of bases and sophisticated military infrastructure in the region, that it doesn't need any of those islands to continue exerting their control. Then what's the catch? Let us keep all the self-sponsored claims of the parties aside and critically examine the ground position. Spratlys are *uninhabited* territory. So no nation can claim them on the basis of historic occupation. It is way too close to Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia landmass geographically than China for its claim to be geographically legitimate. Add to this, the fact that China entered late there (your own findings, which are true). So China can't play the 'first to discover, first to colonize' card either. Spratlys lie totally in the EEZs of these 3 countries and Vietnam's, not China's. So no question of China fishing or rigging oil there. Occupying Spratlys is by no way necessary for China's maritime security or trade either. It is nothing but bullying and Neoimperialism on part of the 'People's Democratic Dictatorship'(Oh, the paradox in those words, would make the subject of a whole book). Even if these countries build military posts there, they are in no position to play any smart games with the Chinese trade ships. One's ships are bound to pass foreign outposts in international trade. Indian ships pass through Suez canal, doesn't mean India asks to build military outposts in Egypt. India maintains good diplomatic relationship with them. India sends its warships to fight Somali pirates, doesn't reclaim submarine elevations off its coast. China needs to learn this. Speaking the other way, if they are trying 'statecraft' only, they should be ready to  cope alone with US and the host of countries feeling alarmed by their bullying.

&gt;The Island Chain Doctrine is real and its a Strategic order threat to China.

Same thing can be said about the Chinese 'string of pearls' in economic context with reference to India. Chinese always love a good game of go, don't they? 

&gt;China has every reason to lash out even more hysterically given what is happening in its vicinity but its response has been nothing short of how a Great Power ought to conduct itself. 

Awww, so nice of them. In reality they have no reason, only claims.

&gt;This is silly talk.  
&gt;Firstly go speak to a Bangladeshi like this.  

Back that day, it was totally possible. They were a surrendered nation.

&gt;Second, Bangladesh was having a guerrilla Independence movement,

Standing on the sole support of India.

&gt;Thirdly, US has Aircraft carrier in the Bay of Bengal even before the war was done

And still Ghazi was sunk. US couldn't and wouldn't wage war on India even back then. Oh yes, now you can go on claiming how Ghazi sank due to malfunction, not in fight.

&gt;they eventually ended up swallowing their pride and letting East Pakistan become Independent.  

They had nothing else to do due to the stalemate.

&gt;Had India went in and annexed the territory even the Soviets would have had a hard time maintaining the balance because that would have been seen as too extreme a step.  

Not when the Sheikh was an open supporter of Indira Gandhi and public opinion in BD was in her favour. Still, she didnt even retain military bases in BD, the way US did in JP, PH and SK. That's the point. Benevolence. We don't need to prove it. Period.

&gt; it took India 4 decades to solve its border with that country. 

Have you ever been to Indo-Bangla border in Bengal, or read about that part? People there still conduct their business as if there are no borders at all. Nobody is troubled by a disputed border. In fact locals took benefit of the ambiguity for trade and intercourse, legal and illegal. It was just the Modi government that created big news of the resolution of the issue. Indifference of the people was a bigger reason for the issue remaining pending than the Government's apathy. Still, Modi's feat was a remarkable one as the Indian Constitution expressly prohibits GoI to cede any territory under any reason whatsoever. Yet he managed to strike the deal in spite of internal and external resisting forces.

&gt; In International State affairs a Ratification IS akin to Law.  

You keep saying this as if it is some holy gospel, but actually it is rubbish. Pray tell me, when Iraq was a permanent UN member, who ratified the US led invasion of Iraq? Does it nullify their validity today? For ratification to acquire the force of law, there has to be someone at a higher level than both the parties, to *enforce* that law. Who is there on the international level? UN?? It is all a '*Jiskee laathi uski bhais*' show. Even if they don't use it in the end, India needs to retain a laathi of its own first, if they are to bring China on legitimate talking terms.

&gt;But when those British claims/positions were themselves illegal, the claim by successor will naturally be illegal as well. 

*You* are the one saying so. Nations don't give a declaration when they disintegrate, they just do. No question of seeking the approval of a disintegrated Chinese empire while signing the Simla accord of 1914.

&gt;Ratification is THE highest State instrument. 

Convenient excuse.

&gt;This is a load of utter nonsense.  

This is the law of our land. Try reading the Indian Contracts Act, 1872.

&gt;States don't just Disappear. They have successor states

Communist China cannot claim all the rights of a successor state to Imperial China, since the transfer of power wasn't a voluntary one in their case, as was with British India and Republic of India. At the risk of being termed childish, I will quote a popular saying in games '*Nayaa bhidu nayaa Raj*'.

 &gt;Furthermore, the territories lost by China from Qing, to Civil War era was handed back to the Chinese State when Japan lost the war. 

So they should have retained their claimed territories when India lost the war too. Why didn't they?

&gt;These things happened because RoC was understood to be the successor state to Qing China. 

""Okay then, we'll talk to RoC."" See where it is heading?

Furthermore, Republic of India itself is a successor state to British India. Its claims on the borders that it has on maps and things like Simla Accord are BECAUSE India claims to be successor state of the British India.  

&gt;Given your absolutely silly logic of since State fragmented and then reintegrated and hence all prior treaties null and void,

It is your silly interpretation, not my silly logic. My logic is straight and clear. Communist China cannot claim to be the legitimate successor state of Imperial China, as far as this issue is concerned. So no question of earlier treaties being in force.

&gt;it would also imply to India since it was by Legal Instrument broken up into 100's of pieces (not 17 like China) and then those pieces had the choice to join on their terms and so on.  

Explained above. That doesn't apply to India.

&gt;See where this is going.  

See where your biased opinions are taking you.

&gt;the last one holds legal ground and that is 1684 Tingmosgan Treaty

Simla accord of 1914. 

&gt;And lest one forget the British in recent years(around 2008) revised their position on Simla Accord 

We are not liable for what they do *after* they depart from India. As simple as that.

&gt;because Indian claims are based on British actions.  

When they were ruling India, not of later.

&gt;The amount of Oil in SCS is exaggerated there is no concrete modern research on this matter. And as mentioned SCS are not important for its oil, its important for its fisheries

Fish *is* a major *resource*, in case you don't know that. Mind reading my statements more carefully?

&gt;and most importantly its Geo-strategic location.  

Yes, that's the real reason China is staking illegitimate baseless claims on it, to dominate others. Already explained above.

&gt;Aksai Chin is barren as well,

Tawang isn't, in the economic sense. That can explain why recently a senior diplomat went 'back-foot' in offering Aksai chin in lieu of Tawang. I wonder what they think Indians are, nursery kids?

It is this same law that can allow the banning of books like Salman Rushdie's ""Satanic Verses"" (1988), and  'Vishwa Itihas (Pratham Bhag)' (banned in 1984) ""on the ground that it contained derogatory reference to Prophet Hazrat Mohammad which outraged the religious feelings of the Muslim community"". 

I mean, [look at this shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_India):

&gt;In 1932, some Muslim clerics denounced a young woman physician named Rashid Jahan, and threatened her with disfigurement and death. She and three others had published a collection of Urdu short stories called Angarey in which they had robustly criticized obscurantist customs in their own community and the sexual hypocrisies of some feudal landowners and men of religion. Under section 295A, the authorities banned the book and confiscated all copies.

&gt;In 1933, police arrested Dr. D'Avoine under section 295A for publishing his article ""Religion and Morality"", which was considered offensive to Roman Catholics, in the September 1933 issue of the magazine Reason. The trial judge found that the article's purpose was consistent with the purpose of the magazine, namely, ""to combat all religious and social beliefs and customs that cannot stand the test of reason and to endeavor to create a scientific and tolerant mentality among the masses of the country"". The trial judge Sir H. P. Dastur found that the article had no malicious intent and did not constitute a violation of section 295A.[17]

&gt;In 1957, Supreme Court uphold decision of lower court. Lower court found publisher Ramji Lal Modi guilty of publishing a cartoon and article which insults religious beliefs of Muslims. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and fined under IPC 295A. Petitioner argued that IPC 295A violated freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(A) of the Constitution and offense of insulting religious beliefs can be committed if there is no danger of public disorder.

&gt;In 1961, Supreme court found Henry Rodrigues guilty of insulting religious beliefs of the Roman Catholics, and acting with a malicious intention in publishing and printing the same in 'Crusader' magazine. The defendant, who was a Roman Catholic, stated that he had criticized certain practices and beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church, which were contrary to what had been stated in the Holy Bible. He further stated that similar views have been expressed in many other well-known work. He was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 200/-and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for one month.[9]

&gt;In 1960, the Supreme Court upheld a decision of Uttar Pradesh government to forfeit all six books written by Baba Khalil Ahamad because it contained derogatory reference to Muawiya, who was governor of Syria and contemporary of Prophet Hazrat Mohammad, which outrages the religious feelings of Sunni Muslim community.[10]

&gt;In 1990, Understanding Islam through Hadis by Ram Swarup was banned.[19] In 1990 the Hindi translation of the book was banned, and in March 1991 the English original became banned as well.[20] Publisher Sita Ram Goel was arrested.[21] Indian intellectuals protested against the arrest of Goel.

&gt;In 1990, Kerala government banned the play Jesus Christ Superstar. In 1991, Kerala High Court uphold the ban and observed that script is against the fundamental belief of the Christian faith and the presentation of Jesus Christ in the play was “both sacrilegious and blasphemous"". In April 2015, Supreme Court of India quashed the ban and observed that Ban has outlived its utility.

&gt;In February 2009, the police arrested Ravindra Kumar and Anand Sinha, the editor and the publisher respectively of the Kolkata-based English daily The Statesman for hurting Muslim sentiments. The police charged Kumar and Sinha under section 295A because they had reprinted an article from The Independent by its columnist Johann Hari. Titled ""Why should I respect oppressive religions?"", the article stated Hari's belief that the right to criticise any religion was being eroded around the world. Muslim protestors in Kolkata reacted to Hari's belief by violent demonstrations at the offices of The Statesman.[29]

&gt;In 2012 Blasphemy Case, Catholic Church accused rationalist Sanal Edamaruku of Blasphemy for his role in examining a claimed miracle at a Catholic church in Mumbai. He fled to Finland to evade his arrest.

&gt;In September 2014, Gujarat Police arrested Sunil Jagdishsinh Rajput whose Facebook post provoked Muslims to go on riot. He was booked under IPC 153(C) and 295(C) and bail was denied.[34]

&gt;In September 2014, Gujarat Police arrested Muslim cleric Mehadi Hasan for calling Navratri a 'festival of demons'.[35]

&gt;In March 2015, Karnataka Police arrested Sriram Yadapadithaya based on a complaint filed by Fr William Menezes of Mangaluru Catholic Diocese. The complaint alleged that Sriram's Facebook comments questioned the basic tenets of Christianity. Flavy D'Souza, president of the Catholic Sabha,had urged authorities to take strict action against people who indulge in such acts. The Catholic Sabha had warned that it would resort to agitation if the authorities failed to do so.[36]

&gt;In Dec 2015, Azam Khan, Senior Minister of Uttar Pradesh government, stated that RSS workers are homo-sexual. In response, Kamlesh Tiwari made an objectionable statement against Prophet Mohammed. Kamlesh Tiwari was arrested and bail was denied. In West Bengal, A Muslim rally against Kamlesh Tiwari lead to Kaliachak riots.[37][38]

Fortunately it seems like the SC has softened its' stance on 295A, but most of the cases since 2007 onwards haven't even *reached* the SC yet. Meaning those people are still either under arrest or facing prosecution.

&lt;/EDIT&gt;

If I start a religion tomorrow based off the ancient texts of the Necronomicon, and manage to get it legally recognized, gather a few hundred followers, and then reveal that even *listening* to the worshiping of other Gods aside from Azathoth and the Outer Gods, will curse our souls to eternal torment, as a chew-toy of this galactic being, and that I am *gravely offended* at the callousness with which my Necronomic bretheren and I are subjected to the *azan* that is played all across India, 5 times a day, effectively either exiling me from my country or damning my soul to infinite munching, then I suppose I could get the courts to ban the Islamic call to prayer forever in India as well. So the law is rife with possibility for abuse by groups with enough clout, motivation, numbers and time.

&gt;* Modi spearheaded the successful election campaign for his Bharatiya Janata Party that led to a landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh has been applauded by global investors as an endorsement of his economic reform agenda.

&gt;* Modis win strengthened his claim to a second term in 2019, and investors are betting it will embolden the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to embark on more reforms including launching the countrywide goods and services tax passage of labour and land acquisition bills.

&gt;* Indias stats office CSO has projected GDP growth at 7.1% for 2016-17, slower than 7.9% in the previous year, as demonetisation crimped consumption and staggered investment.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: A saffron-robed Hindu holy man was sworn in on Sunday to lead India's most populous state, sealing what appears to be a shift in course by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that could redefine the world's largest democracy as a Hindu nation.The choice as Uttar Pradesh chief minister of Yogi Adityanath , a firebrand Hindu ascetic with a history of agitation against minority Muslims, stunned observers who said it marked a departure from the platform of development for all on which Modi rose to national power in 2014.

&gt; * ""Modi, in his victory speech after the Uttar Pradesh triumph, had called for the creation of a ""New India"" by 2022, effectively staking a claim to a second term at the general election that is due to be held in two years.Adityanath, elected five times to the federal parliament from Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, has been magnanimous in victory, pledging to uphold Modi's slogan of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas' ('all together, development for all').

&gt; * ""Everyone who is prejudging the decision is doing it at their own peril - these arguments were also used in the case of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli told Reuters.

&gt; * Although judges have taken cognisance of three cases against Adityanath, no formal charges have been filed.As the month-long Uttar Pradesh poll progressed, the rhetoric used by Modi and his campaign chief Amit Shah struck an increasingly harsh tone: In one speech Modi said villages with graveyards should have crematoriums too - a veiled reference to the different burial practices of Muslims and Hindus.One of India's most prominent Muslim politicians, former Jammu and Kashmir state chief minister Omar Abdullah, said in a tweet that Muslims in Uttar Pradesh ""must be terrified of what the future has in store for them.""

&gt; * Two things are significant - UP was the original ""Hindutva laboratory of the Sangh"" much before Gujarat and by appointing Adityanath, Modi and the Sangh have their best chance at securing 2019 through majoritarian assertion and experiments in the country's largest state which sends 80 MPs to Parliament.

&gt; * Adityanath has a record of minority-baiting and hate speech against Muslims and zero administrative experience, much like Modi when he took over as Gujarat CM.

&gt; * If Modi as Gujarat CM talked of ""hum paanch hamarey 25"" and ""baby-producing factories"" about the Muslim relief camps set up in the aftermath of the 2002 riots, Adityanath has compared Kairana village - from where the mythical exodus of Hindus took place - to ""Kashmir filled with anti-nationals"".

&gt; * He also held the hands of Mulayam, who was seen whispering something to Modi.And the Prime Minister was all ears.In his rallies, Modi had ridiculed the opposition alliance of SP and Congress, saying they together stood for 'SCAM' (Samajwadi, Congress and Mayawati).Not to be outdone, Akhilesh came out with his own take on SCAM, saying it stood for 'Save Country from Amit (Shah) and Modi'.His remark asking megastar Amitabh Bachchan not to endorse ""donkeys of Gujarat"" also left the BJP fuming, with Modi hitting back at the chief minister.BSP supremo Mayawati, however, was not present at the venue.

Even without this, I think this is a masterstroke by Modi in many ways.   

He has made the naughtiest guy in the class the monitor - so now he will behave himself. 11 dimensional chess by Modiji.  

Plus, Yogiji has been surrounded by 2 excellent deputy chief ministers - Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya. Highly development oriented &amp; great governance guys. Hindutva and Vikaas will go hand-in-hand in UP.

- Comes from a humble family. Not a dynastic politician like say Goyal Junior.   
- Very hardworking. He sleeps only 4 hours every night.  
- Doesn't have a wife or kids (just like Modiji or Rahulji). So has no one to be corrupt for. Unlike say Suresh Prabhu.   

- People in Gorakhpur say he is in incorruptible.   
- Highly development oriented.   

- He is a young CM like Soren, Kejriwal etc. Not a old fogey like Amarinder Singh who is fucking 75. I think Singh will sleep through his term like Vajpayeeji.

&gt; * LUCKNOW: With almost all newlyelected BJP MLAs lacking administrative experience, the new government in Uttar Pradesh is likely to be run from the Chief Ministers Office, with guidance from the Prime Ministers Office.

&gt; * This will make the role of bureaucrats and police very important as was the case when Kalyan Singh was the chief minister in 1991.Similarly, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was Gujarat CM, he oversaw most administrative operations with the help of a select team.There is a ray of hope among honest, efficient bureaucrats and seniorto-middle rung policemen that they will be given important postings and a free hand to deliver.

&gt; * The PMO has officials like Nripendra Mishra, PK Sinha and others who know the state like the back of their hands.With BJPs chance of retaining power at the Centre depending heavily on its electoral performance in the state that elects the most number of MPs, the PMO is likely to keep a close tab on Lucknow.Substantial central funds are likely to be allocated to UP under various heads and for infrastructure projects.

&gt; * Though some newlyelected BJP MLAs have been boasting that officials will be posted with their consent, the over-riding criteria is likely to be ability to perform.

&gt; * Unafraid to question the bureaucracy on norms governing decision making for decades, he engaged in technical discussions with the defence forces on requirements of modern weapon systems and, armed with new ideas, promised to kick-start the Make in India initiative.His specialty, the confident defence minister said a few weeks into his tenure, was to ""untie the knots and get things going"".

&gt; * The industry became increasingly vocal with the legitimate frustration that the only Make in India orders being given out were to the public sector and the quick policy changes he wanted to roll out took impossible shapes and deadlines.By mid-2016, even his biggest supporters would admit that Parrikar's ministry was in a deadlock over the most vital functions it performed --- equipping the military, ensuring personnel-related issues are addressed and implementing much needed structural changes.With operational matters of national security being dealt directly at the top level in the Modi government, Parrikar's involvement in tricky issues like border entanglements, tackling of insurgency and dealing with China and Pakistan were several notches lower than his predecessors.In the three biggest security debacles in his tenure --- the June 2015 attack on an army convoy in Manipur, the Pathankot airbase breach in January 2016 and Uri attack in September that left 19 soldiers dead --- the aftermath has been dealt directly by the Prime Minister's Office.This included the two cross-border strikes into Myanmar and Pakistan and the operation to clear the airbase that were monitored and controlled by the PMO in direct coordination with the armed forces.Insiders point out that unlike most of his predecessors, who spent considerable time visiting troops at forward locations, Parrikar had minimal field interaction.In his two year-plus tenure, the minister went to the Siachen glacier just once.

&gt; * His focus area remained Goa, which the minister visited almost every weekend throughout his South Block stint --- with a Friday evening Indigo flight being his preferred mode of travel.The two biggest decisions during the Parrikar tenure to purchase military systems too saw direct involvement from the top echelons of the government.The $7.8 billion deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighters was negotiated between top PMO officials and the French government and the multi-billion dollar int e r government a l agreement to make Kamov Ka-226 choppers with Russia too followed the same route.In the limited time that he had, Parrikar, however, made some brilliant interventions that saved the exchequer thousands of crores of rupees.

&gt; * With Parrikar determined that the best way forward was to preselect a clutch of private sector companies for large orders and the bureaucracy advising him against it, procurements under Make in India have been stuck for over 18 months.In its meetings with the PMO, industry representatives shared how a lack of orders by the defence ministry is holding them back.

&gt; * ""In past 15 years, UP lacked in race of development as previous governments indulged in corruption, nepotism and failed on the law and order front due to which people were affected,"" he said.

&gt; * 'What has hit me between the eyes is Modi's seeming utter contempt for public perception of the yogi being an unrepentant bigot who also carries the baggage of many criminal cases against him,' says B S Raghavan, the distinguished civil servant.

&gt; * When Narendra Modi led the Bharatiya Janata Party to a spectacular victory in 2014, I, as an independent political analyst and commentator, was one of the first to celebrate it in these columns as a golden opportunity for the country to try out an alternative national mainstream governing model after nearly 40 years of hotchpotch coalitions, the last of which, between 2004 and 2014, misnamed the United Progressive Alliance, spread the sickening stink of corruption and downright loot and plunder all over India.

&gt; * How can such a sharply intelligent and aware person like Modi, with the vision of building a new India, be so very blind to the fact that in taking the nation in the right direction in terms of values and precepts, perception counts far more than reality, even assuming that they can be different, as perhaps Modi believes it to be in the yogi's case?

---

&gt;* The best thing about Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member Yogi Adityanath becoming the chief executive of Indias most populous and politically sensitive state is the plain honesty of the messaging.

&gt;* If the country takes the bait, long years of a slow and steady battle by the BJP and its ideological fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), would have finally fructified.

&gt;* Vajpayees more vitriolic colleague, Lal Krishna Advani, spearheaded the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s that resulted in wanton bloodshed and turmoil in the country.

&gt;* The democratic ideal of power sharing, and being seen doing so, forgotten, the absence of a huge segment of Indians from the BJPs representative politics suggests an active move to render them irrelevant by consolidating the majority votes.

&gt;* For all the talk of development that Modi used during his prime ministerial campaign, he peppered it with a generous dose of communal sparks, taking care not to unleash large-scale violence or fears, yet just enough to keep the embers alive.

&gt; It signals that the BJP will now be dominated by extremes, its politics shaped largely by resentment rather than hope, collective narcissism rather than an acknowledgement of plurality, hate rather than reconciliation, and violence rather than decency.





&gt; what is striking about Adityanath’s political career so far is that there is not even a whiff of acknowledgement that he might need to speak to something larger, acknowledge civility, or stay away from fear-mongering and the legitimisation of violence.

Yet the actual revenue growth of manufacturing companies [*fell* by -3.7%](http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/more-layoffs-likely-as-indias-manufacturing-sales-shrink-11057) during the same fiscal year according to the RBI.

During the demonetisation quarter, 86% of the currency was removed, yet private consumption supposedly grew by a whopping 10.1%. Even as companies in the FMCG sector reported stagnant or even falling revenues. Proxies for rural demand, such as two-wheelers, fell off a cliff. Then you have the problem with the [GDP deflators](https://youtu.be/rYTy2mDQqXo?t=13m13s). 

Most people agree that the new system, the SNA 2008 from the UN, is better than the old. But a framework is just a reference. There is still considerable leeway in how you implement that framework and this is where the divergence from best-practices begin, for example most international leaders use double deflation(WPI+CPI and then average it out to get real GDP derived from nominal GDP), whereas India only uses single-deflation and often uses a weird metric, such as WPI for services sector whereas WPI is better suited for industrial sector. It goes on like that.

Moving on, If you aren't sensible enough to understand the scale and implications of Brexit you'll be too neckbeard to understand anyways no worries. 

The thoughts you have about the CM and PM are not facts but **OPINIONS** and opinions differ , facts don't. 

FACT- BREXIT is both socio-economically fucked up for UK.
OPINION- Narendra Modi committed mass genocide. 

I am in no way a fan of either side of the govt, be it ruling or opposition but what I can't stand is people who don't know their facts or people who don't understand the difference between opinions and facts. SMH.

362,"I really have to add to this topic, yet again.

Can you imagine, Modi and Amit Shah, sat together some day 2 or so years ago and Said – We need to win UP. 
They realized that they couldn’t. They couldn’t beat the people who already had their presence in the state.
And so they thought the unthinkable. “We know that most people have money in cash, and what if that cash was worthless?”
Thus came demonetization, and almost certainly the departure of RR from the RBI. The power of the state, used in new ways to ensure political victory. 
Fucking amazing. Forget the economic cost, the time wasted, the tax payer money being blown.

They saw exactly what the Indian voter is – a bipolar blowhard, flipping between deep patriotism and massive cynicism. And they played them. Holy shit, they played them. 
The same people who would be upset about money being used for hajj subsidies, were happy to stand in line because they believed it would stop corruption. The same people who were unhappy paying taxes for no results, literally had their money made worthless for no direct result.
Its truly amazing. I suspect that this will go down in history, if not set precedents for other countries to follow.
We are truly in the presence of Genius. 

Now I am no longer concerned about the state of a democracy without an actual opposition – there will never be one in this country for a long time, perhaps in our life times.
I am more worried about whats going to happen when he leaves office! He is going to leave boots too big to fill.

&gt; Apparently, both sides wanted to claim credit for the new station and its name. The station, on the western line, was earlier meant to be named Oshiwara, after the surrounding area. However, it was renamed Ram Mandir after a nearby temple, following demands by the BJP and Shiv Sena.

&gt; The fracas started as workers of the BJP, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal started shouting slogans such as ‘Jay Shri Ram, Modi and Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ as the start of the event. Shiv Sena workers — who were present in sizeable numbers — responded with slogans such as ‘Udhavaji ki Jai’ and ‘Shiv Sena Zindabad’. Leaders from each party blamed the other for the chaos.

&gt; Shiv Sena leader Ravindra Waikar and BJP leader Vidya Thakur each credited their own parties for naming the staion.

411,"&gt; What's so holy about J&amp;K's unity and not about that of say, Maharashtra?




Don't particularly care if they split J&amp;K, but a lot of people are against it. When has BJP attacked Maharasthra's unity?




&gt; What if I show you it has happened?




Please show.



&gt;  In fact I was a BJP supporter to begin with, since my schooldays and always supported BJP when I joined this forum. 




Yep, I saw your post defending Gadkari.




&gt; Narendra has been conspiring with Pawar since long, there's a report of both meeting in a closed room in Goa in 2013!



Keeping options open is smart, considering the acrimonious relationship between BJP-SS and Modi-Uddhav. Besides that, this is completely speculation and baseless. For all you know, there were only pleasantries exchanged. They were at the same place for the same event.




&gt; And it also maintains that it aims to remove even allies from positions of power - 'shatpratishat BJP'.




BJP is fine in Punjab, and was fine in Bihar too before JDU's betrayal. The smaller parties are still with BJP. The events in MH were pure opportunism, but the architects: Munde and Mahajan are dead. It's time to move on, and BJP has made efforts to mend the relationship.




&gt; How is that a decline of the Sena? 



Let's see: Sena lost voteshare and seats.




&gt; In fact, the Sena has withstood the massive Wave that has washed away SP, BSP, Congress etc and prevented BJP from attaining anything similar to what they did in UP without doing anything what happened in Bihar. You really don't think that is a massive feat in itself?



I agree, it's pretty impressive. I'm not questioning Uddhav's leadership. But it still doesn't change the fact that BJP is currently winning the civil war, and has shown massive gains throughout MH. Fadnavis has successfully emerged as the regional satrap, which Uddhav didn't anticipate. 





&gt;  but still check out the situation in the local bodies of the district from where Chandrakant Patil hails



What's the situation? Can't find a reference anywhere.



&gt; you'll realize why BJP suddenly found merit in friendship.



BJP has found merit on multiple occasions recently; the acrimony has been largely coming from Uddhav's side.

IMO, they check the public temperature with these things. To check temperature they can use criteria like: does the sheep forwards to other sheep? does the sheep appear happy while reading the message (yes I'm saying they're looking at you through your phone camera)? etc. etc.

With all this data they can easily plan next elections, staged events, policies etc.

Eg. in this case they'll evaluate if significant number of sheep like the above points. If yes modi will implement (not enforce) a puny policy on similar lines thus increasing his approval ratings and thus people will be less likely protest when he again rigs the next election.

414,"&gt; Where have you heard these?




Speculation I suppose, from a friend who has decent links to BJP through his uncle.




&gt;  If Modi wanted a CM with administrative capabilities to fulfill his promises there wasn't anyone better suited than him. 



True; but there are two Deputy Chief Ministers too, and the PMO can remote control the administration. Additionally, Yogi is perceived as a very strong leader, and can push the bureaucracy and police harder. And he can restrain the fringe, similar to how Modi restrained VHP/BDal in Gujarat.



&gt; After Kalyan Singh retired he was the most popular and experienced BJP leader in UP. 



Yogi is more popular than Rajnath among BJP voters. Moreover, he has a major caste advantage as he's a ""Yogi"" and consequently, has a more uniform across-castes following. Rajnath's support base is primarily only Thakurs, who back Yogi too.




IMO, this is a risky gamble to change the narrative against Hindutva. If Modi succeeds and Yogi only focusses on ""Sab ka saath, sab ka vikaas,"" then the entire plank of minority baiting loses its appeal.



&gt; Like with defense Modi isn't lacking in other leaders that could be Home Minister.



Why has he given Defence to Jaitley than? He still needs to replace Parrikar, and if Rajnath left, he would have to find 2 Cabinet Ministers. Plus Home Ministry is more critical than Defence in the short term. Any screw up here will directly affect electoral chances. Defence is semi-redundant as I don't see a war starting between nuclear powers, due to MAD.



&gt; Was it that Rajnath did not want to return to UP or was it that Modi and Shah didn't want him to?



I don't think we can ever know for sure. Now, there are rumours that Shah was wary of making Rajnath the most important leader after Modi; However, there were also rumours from before the results that Rajnath doesn't want to return to State politics.",2017-03-21 15:15:32

Aadhar is central to this. Its web will soon stretch into all corners of society. Part of it is rooting out corruption, but part of it is also maximising mobilisation capacity of the state. If your private life has to be trampled on to do it, then so be it. 

Finally, a darker aspect of it will be the immense power it confers upon those who sit at the top. When people's entire lives depend on Aadhar, those who control the system will in effect control the lives of those under it. ",2017-03-21 21:26:16

You project someone as leader, give them important position, get them to address rallies, make decisions, be in news, they will become a pan India figure.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: UP CM Yogi Adityanath and his Gorakhnath Mutt have always enjoyed special connection with Hindu-majority Nepal and its erstwhile royal family.When former King Gyanendra organised Virat Hindu Mahasamelan in Nepal last October, Adityanath was also invited.

&gt; * The erstwhile royal family of Nepal are Gorkhas who trace their origin to Guru Gorakshanath or Gorakhnath, the founder of the Nath monastic movement in the Himalayan belt Nepals King Birendra , who was assassinated along with other family members in 2001 by his own son, was a symbol of tradition for this Mutt and for many years he launched Makar Sankranti festival in Nepal by visiting the Mutt.Birendra looked up to Mahant Avaidyanath (mentor of Adityanath), former religious and temporal head of the Gorakhnath monastery, as his guru.

&gt; * In 1992, King Birendra himself drove down from Kathmandu to the Gorakhpur Mutt.It was understood that King Birendra decided on the continuation of the Hindu state, the Hindu king and a ban on cow slaughter when Nepals constitution was amended in 1990 on the advice of Avaidyanath.Avaidyanath counselled many members of the royal family and was never fully convinced that Birendra and his family members were assassinated by the kings son.

&gt; * Avaidyanath was succeeded by Adityanath in 2014 as the head of the Mutt.Following the 2015 earthquake, the Mutt was involved in relief operations and helped in reconstruction of temples and pagodas in parts of Nepal.

**why left is against anti-brahminism?**

Look at the leaders of top left parties of India.

CPI(M) : Sitaram Yechury - Telugu Brahmin

Congress : Rahul Gandhi(?) - Kashmiri Pandit

AAP(?) : Arwind Kejriwal - upper caste bania  Manish Sisodia: Rajput

Put your hand on your heart, do you think any of the leader, howsoever popular, can rise above these leaders in their parties?

Why do you think AAP appointed Rakhi Birla, preceded by, Bandana Kumari, both popular SC woman leaders to the inconsequential role of Deputy Speaker of Delhi Assembly while other upper caste leaders got place in the cabinet?

**Why left's support of gay rights is just lip service?**

First look at the BJP leaders. Atal-Advani are almost inseparable and always named together. Similar is the case of Modi and Shah.

    Did you see the pattern?

Atalji never married while Modiji left her wife. I will leave the rest for you to draw your own conclusions.

BJP knows that Indian public inherently follows left wing ideology (You can see it in public's support of free dole-outs- Amma/Abba canteens etc). That's why they can not come out openly. Yet, BJP internally elected these two man as PM knowing their personal lives. 

Look at the left wing parties. Almost all their leaders are married.(Some have extra-marital affairs also but that's a topic for another time). Where are their LGBT leaders missing?

&gt;* In his June 2016 remarks to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi declared that India and the United States must convert shared ideals into practical cooperation. A necessary starting point is the U.S.-India Security Partnership, including an implementation plan for the 2015 Defense Trade and Technology Initiative.

&gt;* They point to Modis victory platform in the 2014 Indian elections  tougher border control measures, stricter vetting of refugees entering the country, government reform against special interest politics  and note its resemblance to the major themes of the Trump campaign.

&gt;* India is supportive of President Trumps well-articulated foreign policy agenda, including an American rapprochement with Russia to pursue the shared goal of fighting radical Islamists.

&gt;* A strong American response to the growing number of Chinese port and military bases, particularly in unstable regimes encircling the Indian Ocean trade route, is also very desirable.

&gt;* A durable and effective American security partnership with India, including an implementation plan for the 2015 Defense Trade and Technology Initiative, is a very good place to start.

&gt; * The ascent of Yogi Adityanath to the top job in Indias politically most important state is ripe with significance for markets precisely because it underlines a trend of addressing the bottom of the pyramid that has gained ground over the past year.Make no mistake: the choice of Adityanath is not about building a temple at Ayodhya, or at least, not just about that.

&gt; * The similarities between Modi 1.0 and Yogi are striking: Hardline Hindutva (and accusations of abetting communal violence), the RSS influence, the energy born of meditation and yoga, and last but not least, the single status seen as precluding the need to amass wealth.This is what gave birth to the Gujarat Model  zero tolerance for inefficiency and corruption, efficient administration and a focused development agenda.Of course, Uttar Pradesh is no Gujarat.

&gt; * This is unlikely to be achieved through runaway increase in subsidy; directed subsidy will get further expanded into more areas and a possible introduction of Universal Basic Income that subsumes myriad grants from the state may be on the anvil.The sectors that should get a fillip are basic consumption (staples), low- to mid- income housing, agriculture, and to some extent rural consumption.

&gt; * On the agrochem side, growth rates for agrochem players would be supported by rising adoption of high-value molecules, rising adoption of herbicides and fungicides.While markets arent really cheap, investors should gradually build up position in these promising areas that are likely to benefit from the Modi-Adityanath kind of political dispensation.

---

&gt; * Close on the heels of a series of big visitors, New Delhi is preparing to welcome Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the first week of May for a visit that will be significant both for its timing and impact on bilateral ties, MEA and Turkish officials confirmed to The Hindu.

&gt; * The Turkish President is expected to travel to Delhi with a large entourage of ministers, officials said, for his first visit to India since 2008.

&gt; * This visit was long overdue, and we have been preparing for it for sometime, ever since it had to be put off in August 2015, a Turkish diplomat said, adding that President Erdogan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi share a good relationship, having met twice already, including once in Turkey for the G-20 summit.

&gt; * India will be among the first countries, if not the first to also welcome the Turkish President after what is being seen as a controversial referendum on April 16th which will turn Turkey from a parliamentary democracy to an executive presidency, abolish the Prime Ministers post, give the president several new powers, and allow him two five-year terms after the next elections in 2019.

---

&gt;* Bar Council of India (BCI) chairman Manan Kumar Mishra has posted an update on his official Facebook page threatening that lawyers will come on roads if the Law Commission were to recommend that a new regulator should handle disciplinary complaints against advocates.

&gt;* B.C.I.n State Bar Coucils r sufficient enough to deal with the matters relating to Disciplinary actions,strikes boycotts ,abstainance etc. (sic) added Mishra in his missive

&gt;* By itself, Mishras post is nothing new: he had made a similar threat in a letter to prime minister Narendra Modi in November of last year, duly seasoned with a dollop of sycophancy, while trying to dissuade the government from reducing the role of the BCI in legal regulation.

&gt;* However, the latest BCI draft sent to the Law Commission, which was arrived at after consultation with several retired judges and non-BCI lawyers, seemed rather more robust, according to the 16 March Times of India report by Dhananjay Mahapatra.

&gt;* Update: Another, similar but shorter post on Mishras personal Facebook page, has attracted 579 likes and 112 comments, though not 100% of those are supportive (one lawyer wrote: Wrong explanation Sir, u r taking an initiative which is not good for future of law professional.... kindly see medical council where ony medical practitioner is in panel of enquiry.. kindly correct me if Im wrong.. awaiting ur replay.

&gt;* Mr. Krishna is considered an influential leader of the Vokkaliga community which, along with the 19% Lingayat vote, is the second biggest dominant caste in the State.

&gt;* Sources declined to comment on what the quid pro quo to Mr. Krishnas joining the BJP was, and dismissed speculation that either his daughter or son-in-law would be given a Rajya Sabha seat.

&gt;* His Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is now fighting a battle on data speeds in a bid to dominate the worlds fastest growing smartphone market.

&gt;* The feud showcases the struggle to lure customers in the worlds second-largest mobile phone market where intense competition prompted Jio to offer completely free services until March 31 and Vodafone Group Plc to combine its Indian unit with Idea Cellular Ltd. With voice revenues plunging and with 92 percent of the country accessing the Internet through their mobile phones, broadband speeds will be crucial as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tries to get more Indians online through his Digital India program.

&gt;* The Internet is going to be Indias backbone as more and more users come online through mobile phones, saidSatish Meena, a New Delhi-based analyst at Forrester Research India Pvt.

&gt; * Now the filling up of vacancy in the High Courts can be sped up.

&gt; * Setting stage for the stiff judiciary vs government confrontation, the bench led by Justice Khehar had in October 2015 struck down a new law brought in by the Modi government - National Judicial Appointments Commission which had given it a major role, including veto powers, in matters relating to appointment and transfer of apex court and high court judges and asked the Centre to prepare fresh memorandum of procedure in consultation with the CJI.

&gt;* SM Krishna, one of the tallest Congress leaders in Karnataka who quit the party after 46 years in January, formally joined the BJP this afternoon at its headquarters in New Delhi.

&gt;* The veteran leader, who had said the Congress did not need him, described the step as ""a very important stop in my onward journey"".At the programme, attended by party chief Amit Shah and other key leaders of the BJP, he said India has progressed ""because of the leadership of PM Modi and Amit Shah"".One of the towering figures in the Congress, Mr Krishna's shift raises concerns about large-scale defection from the party's state unit as the Siddaramaiah government faces assembly elections next year.

&gt;* It is also a huge shot in the arm for the BJP, which, after seizing control of three of the seven north-eastern states, is looking for a foothold in the south.The 84-year-old had resigned from the Congress' primary membership, miffed that the party's state unit did not give him a key role or consulted him on key issues.A trusted aide of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, Mr Krishna, who served as Karnataka's Chief Minister between 1999 and 2004, is credited with setting up Bengaluru as the nation's IT hub.

&gt;* Later, he served as the Maharashtra Governor and even had a stint as the country's external affairs minister during the UPA government.

&gt;* Later, he returned to Karnataka, hoping to play a role in state politics.A day after he quit Congress, Mr Krishna said the party did not need mass leaders any more.

488,"I think no one gets it.

Mukesh Ambani had no intention of insulting Rajdeep. His answer wasn't tongue in cheek either. Nor was it frivolous. 

It was the question Rajdeep asked. He did so without knowing the severity and the possible impact of it. 

Mukesh Ambani was taken aback and got a bit worried and answered it in the best possible way.

The problem was Rajdeep equating or even putting Mota Bhai at higher pedestal than Modi. Mota bhai got worried that if Modi hears this, he is not going to like it. Something like *'How can Ambani think he is bigger than the PM and Government, koi baap ki dukan hai kya?'*. 

So giving a long explanation of how he isn't the biggest etc wouldn't have washed. The question had to be killed and mocked. That's what Ambani did. ",2017-03-22 20:03:53
489,"This is a nice thought. Well said too. It won't deter the ones won't clear biases here though. 

Take Yogi. The narrative on reddit about Yogi is already set and will continue: 

* Yogi is inherently​ communal, 
* wants to kill all Muslims, 
* rules by intimidation of minorities, and is a goon/thug,
* the reason Muslims voted for BJP is because they're scared of the Hindus,
* the reason they're supporting Yogi is because they're scared of him,
* riots and pogroms like Godhra will take place,
* Modi selected Yogi to give minorities the middle-finger,
* every bit of positive mention about Yogi is whitewashing, across all media,
* he talked about raping corpses of Muslim women
* Etc.

Joking about it is fine, but some appear to believe their own narrative, which is pretty unpleasant. 

I'm worried about Yogi too, because his presence may embolden the nutjobs who might think that they have a free-pass to indulge in communal violence. 80-90% of the pro-BJP voices on here are apprehensive about Yogi too, many of them even more than me. /u/bhiliyam, /u/pure_haze, /u/Puddleofsweat for instance have been pretty damn dismayed about it. Puddle says he's ""aghast"" at the choice.

That said, nobody is willing the give the fuckin' guy a *week*, much less a month or a year to do his goddamn job. A man they hadn't *heard* about till a month back is suddenly someone they know *everything* about. Right. 

_____________________

Edit2: My biggest problem with this entire narrative is that *every* damn thing that he says or does from this point forward is now going to be viewed through the ""confirmation filter"" that will seek to validate every one of those points. He solves a longstanding problem of some small muslim community? ""He wants them to lower their guard so he can slaughter them"". He says something positive about his own faith? ""See? He's communal"". He declares Eid a public holiday? ""Whitewashing the (secret) atrocities he has committed since he came to power"". He singlehandedly fights off a Hindu mob to protect a Muslim village? ""Propaganda"". Hell, he could literally do *ANYTHING*, from a fart to a breakthrough in quantum physics, he could solve world hunger, and he could make UP a place where peace, equality, rule-of-law, and development, become more than just words, they become *everyday reality*, and these folks will *STILL* find a way to twist it into how he's something that's raw evil. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't expect anything *saintly* from him, just for him to be a little better than what he used to be. He's going to remain human, and some of that resentment he has in him will remain too, but as long as he keeps people safe, brings electricity and water to millions who live without it, gets the babus to *do work*, and gets the cops to do their damn jobs, and controls the ones who have let power get to their heads, I'd consider him the best CM that UP has had in decades. But the ""narrative"" folks? Their belief is unfalsifiable. There is no action that he can take to make them appreciate him.


___________________

Edit:

&gt;I wanted to point out the irrationality and gullibility of the people on the right for whom two wrongs make a right. All their arguments have to start with 'This was happening in the past too. And against us. So now we will rise and end discrimination'. 

I don't think a single one of the people on the right that I've seen here, thinks that 2 wrongs make a right. The ""this was happening since X came to power"" isn't a justification of it continuing. It's an unspoken question, about where these people who are tarring the Right for some incident​ were hiding when their favourites were engaged in the same practices. It's pointing out the fake outrage that they put on, simply because they hate *the person*, not the act. Modi becoming PM has done wonders for secularism and liberalism in the country because *suddenly*​, literally overnight, all the Left-wingers have magically gained such deep insight into things they do not support any longer, despite being absolutely oblivious to them just a few weeks ago. It's a farce and it needs to be pointed out, because the very same people will again go silent whenever​ it happens​ at the hands of someone they don't hate, who is Certified Secular®^TM . That's just plain, old-school hypocrisy.

&gt;But for lack of their logic and rationality, they think that the way to end discrimination is to reverse it against the discriminators. These are the kind of people who would if they see their sisters getting molested would molest the sister of the perpetrator and feel good about the revenge they just tasted against someone who doesn't respect women. 

Seriously. You've seen multiple comments like this by right-wingers on reddit? Or is this a strawman? The only thing the right-wingers on reddit want (as far as I've seen) is Uniform Civil Code. They want equality across the board. Where is this group who wants revenge? Revenge for what?",2017-03-22 20:06:16

493,"Some interviewers in India think they can mock anyone. Rajdeep was talking out of his ass, both at the beginning of the interview (most powerful man but not Modi ) and then at the end (something something Ambani to Modi... gujarati time). He asked if Cafe Mysore goes to Mukeshbhai's house.What sort of fuckery is that? I mean if Ambani drowns himself in Cafe Mysore idli batter and sits in his private steam room, it is his business. His other questions (what motivates you?) was nonsense and he then referred to education as Ambani's 3rd innings. 

I have no idea who the interview was intended for, but this is another nail in RS's 'not to be taken seriously as a journalist' coffin.
