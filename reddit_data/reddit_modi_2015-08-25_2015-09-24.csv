&gt;* Apart from the fact that college student Mamata Banerjee became famous for jumping up and down on the bonnet of Jayaprakash Narayan's car, the real irony is even as Didi was tweeting out her support for far away Pune,she was being booed in her own backyard on the hallowed grounds of Presidency University.

&gt;* When FTII director Prashant Pathrabe called police into the campus after he was confined to his cabin by protesters, media in Kolkata wrote about the shadow of Kolkatas Jadavpur University on Pune.

&gt;* At the behest of Mamata Banerjee, it is true, but not until a long bitter and acrimonious stand-off between the students and the administration had played out in the media with the Left Front stoking the flames.

&gt;* When an Arun Jaitley comes to Kolkata to inaugurate a Bandhan Bank and makes appreciative noises about a pleasant change, the CPM sees that as him using the dais to increase Mamatas comfort level.

&gt;* ""At the time of Independence, there was not even a 'paywat' (walking trail) connecting Gundegaon to adjoining village,"" Bhapkar, who has studied till seventh standard in Modi language, said.When Bhapkar, who worked in zilla parishad school between 1957 to 1991, was working at Kolegaon, people from his villages had to cross three villages to reach there.Bhapkar remembers asking government authorities to build a road cutting across the 700 meter high Santosha hill.With no help forthcoming, he embarked on a journey of grit and determination, which 57 years later would result in seven roads, altogether 40km long, linking his village to the adjoining villages.Earlier, the route to Kolegaon via Deulgaon was 29km long.

&gt;* The distance became just 10km after Bhapkar, through sheer grit, cut through the hill and made a kuchcha road.He paid wages from his pocket to those who accompanied him in the road work.

&gt;* ""I used to spend half my salary on their wages,"" Not a single rupee from the government has been spent on the road work,"" he adds.

&gt; and is now taking out this tamasha to make his name. Being propped up by Politicians on both sides. 
 
So, joining career in Politics is tamasha ? If someone wants to start career in Politics, usually good starting point is to support a community and take leadership of a cause. The cause here is Patel Reservation.  
 
&gt; If someone like him was begging for money on road you would ask him to get a proper job. 
 
So, taking leadership is not a proper job? Modiji started his career as RSS Pracharak. Was that a proper job according to you? Atal Bihari Vajpayee started his career as Arya Samaj Secretary, Was that a proper job according to you? 
 
Do you seriously expect everyone to get a average 9to5 job? 
 
&gt; This guy is doing nothing else but begging for something and has whipped up people in a frenzy when there is nothing wrong with the Patel community in Gujarat.
&gt;There is no valid reason given for reservations for Patels apart from - ""We have received no special treatment since Independence"". 
 
I see no argument or reasoning from you on this matter. Of course Patel needs reservation. Poor and middle class Patels are abundant in Gujarat. In Gujarat 49% in reserved. Out of 51% 20% seats are also taken up by top students of Reserved cast. So, poor and middle class patel have to fight for 30% of remaining seats to Bramhins, Rajputs and others. 
 
Either remove OBC entirely and start giving every poor and middle class same chance by reservation, regardless of caste. If not, Make A Quota system and make reserved students to take only reserved seats and prohibit them for coming unreserved.",2015-08-25 18:44:30

Not all Patels are economically well off. IN Surat, thousands of Patel Hiraghasu(People who polish diamond)  merely earns 5000 rs per month. In Kathiyad, Lakhs of Poor Patel farmers hardly earn enough to provide good education to their children. They have to constantly face act of gods like flood, over rain, drought etc. and government hardly provides any financial support during this.  
 
In Gujarat 1000 seats are Government Medical colleges, out of this only 450 is available to unreserved caste like Patel. Out of these 450, 200 seats are filled by clever and outstanding SC/ST/OBC. Patel has to fight for remaining 250 seats with all other unreserved. Should a patel poor student forget his dream of becoming a doctor because he lacks just 1 marks, when a millionaire OBC's son becomes a doctor without far less marks than him? 
 
Mano ya naa mano, but we definitely failed as society, when a poor farmer's son can't get into college just because of 1 mark less, while a millionaire ST's son, without studying whole year, easily gets into it.


&gt; No, I don't expect him to get a 9 to 5 job. I expect anyone with his background, being healthy to work hard and not blame his inability to do anything on the government.  
 
Not his inability, but inability of whole Patel caste is the fault of government. 80% goverment officiers/clerks/government teachers are from reserved category. 60-65% seats in top colleges are hold by reserved category.",2015-08-25 19:14:18

&gt;* He took on the leadership of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, an offshoot of the Sardar Patel Sevadal, in July and launched the agitation from the politically important Mehsana, which is the home district of not just Anandiben but also Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.

&gt;* In a recently released video on the website of his Sardar Patel Sevadal, Hardik has been shown emerging from raging flames and shattering glass amid firecrackers, while being showered with rose petals.

&gt;* The Patidars have fully rallied behind him and his demand that the community, which has for years wielded immense political and financial clout in the state, needs reservations in government jobs and colleges.

&gt; * To precisely understand OROP quantitatively, heres an example: An officer of a rank of a Major who retires before 2005 gets a pension of 30000, where as a Major retiring after 2005 gets a pension of 35000, even after serving for the same tenure and retiring at the same age.

&gt; * One rank one pension has been a demand by the armed forces since 1973, after the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, discontinued it by way of an ex-parte decision following the third central pay commission, previously it was uniform and OROP was followed.

&gt; * Though the Director General (Resettlement) or DGR which works under Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare, set up in 2004, in the Ministry of Defence, India, prepares the ex-servicemen for a second career , 100% of resettlement is not practically possible pertaining to various issues.

&gt; * Prime Minister Modi in his speech on 15th August, 2015, has reiterated about accepting the OROP, at principles and a positive outcome might result soon, but this requires a little patience and thoughtfulness towards the financially weaker section.

---

&gt;* One Rank One Pension (OROP) for the armed forces was perhaps the first electoral promise made by Narendra Modi in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

&gt;* Accompanied by former army chief General VK Singh, Modi accused the UPA government of disrespecting the armed forces by not implementing the OROP.

&gt;* Prima facie, the demand isn't unjustified as both veterans as well as their families need to make ends meet according to today's economic realities.

&gt;* Even police forces in insurgency affected states like Jammu and Kashmir, Chhattisgarh and Manipur can put forward similar demands.

&gt;* According to former bureaucrat Avay Shukla, the root of the problem lies in the fact that the upper echelons of the civil services have awarded themselves the benefit of an OROP-like system.

90,"Rahul Roushan's fuckery about Modi aside, he is spot on on reservations.

&gt; You might find it ironical that I say that OBCs have caught up after Mandal, but I support caste based reservations for SCs, who have been getting benefits of reservations since independence.
&gt; 
&gt; Probably because you missed one thing I said – OBCs have acquired political power and clout, which SCs have not been able to. Social change comes through political change, and SCs have not been too lucky on that count.
&gt; 
&gt; It will be tragic if this feeling of post-Mandal injustice is extended to SCs. And there is this risk because the cutoffs, the barometer of post-Mandal injustice, for SCs are usually much lower.
&gt; 
&gt; Awareness and compassion about why caste based reservations should stay for SCs, despite those low cutoffs, need to be communicated. Young urban Indian has to be realized that SCs still have to face a lot of caste based prejudices, and thus caste based compensation is needed.
&gt; 
&gt; So do I favor doing away with caste based reservations for OBCs but retaining the same for SCs? I will not be politically correct here, and say that yes, to an extent, I believe in that solution.
&gt; 
&gt; I’d propose that in case of OBCs, the primary criteria should be made economical i.e. 27% seats are reserved for economically weaker sections, with preferential allotment on the basis of caste. So a cutoff is created not based on caste, but based on economic status, but preference is given to OBCs (because you can’t wish away castes in entirely yet) in that list.
&gt; 
&gt; This will still be effectively an OBC reservation, but will assuage this feeling of post-Mandal injustice to a large extent. It might sound too early right now, but this is what I believe we should be moving towards.",2015-08-26 09:03:18

---

&gt; * Meanwhile, the gap between expenditure in urban and rural areas widened, but rural areas themselves experienced a sharp decline in inequality due to proactive government interventions in the form of welfare programs and agricultural worker mobilizations for higher wages.

&gt; * As in China after 1992, it was a series of market-oriented, Big Businessfriendly economic reforms introduced in India in 1991 that contributed significantly to rising inequality.

&gt; * In addition, Modis Make in India strategy that invites foreign and domestic capital to invest in Indian manufacturing to make the country an important manufacturing hub of the world may not succeed and will not reduce inequality.

&gt; * These policies will only further accelerate the trends that India has seen over the last two decades, and Indian inequality is likely to accelerate, despite resistance from agricultural workers, workers in the organized sector in urban areas, and from various political parties in opposition.

The new castes being added to the reserved classes are the main issue. There should be a proper caste based census done to find out how each social group is faring on the socio-economic scale, then efforts need to be take to remove those classes which have gone forward. 

I don't completely agree with the ""give reservations based on economic conditions"" argument. The main reason being that it's easy to fake your economic conditions and I know we Indians have taken some genius efforts to save tax / appear poor to get benefits. 

One option I have been pondering about is *One time Reservation* Policy. Where the reservation benefits can be used only once in a person's lifetime. Either for admissions in college/schools or for jobs. But once that benefit is used, the person will have to be treated as a general candidate.

109,"Over 40,000 register for PM Narendra Modi's reception at Silicon Valley

---

&gt;* WASHINGTON: Over 40,000 people have signed up to listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to Indian-Americans in Silicon Valley on September 27, surpassing the 30,000 registrations at last year's Madison Square Garden reception for him in New York.With about a month still to go, organisers of the event hope that the number could cross 50,000, a record in itself.By last night when registration process for members of 500 community organisations concluded, officials of organising Indo-American Community of West Coast told PTI that more than 40,000 people had registered for the September 27 event.With individual registration process for those who are not members of any community organisations being part of the reception kicking off in the next few days, organisers said they expect the total number of registrations to cross 50,000.

&gt;* ""This is a phenomenal response.

&gt;* It's simply Modi Magic,"" Vijay Chauthaiwale , in charge, foreign relations department of BJP, who is currently in Silicon Valley on a short visit to review the preparations, told PTI.Notably some 30,000 people had registered for the Madison Square Garden reception in New York last September where Modi was given a rock star reception.As a result of the huge response, after the individual registration process ends, organisers would be conducting a computerised draw of lots to determine who all would be receiving the free tickets for what would be the first ever public address to the Indian-Americans in West Coast.Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit California after Morarji Desai in 1978.Jawahar Lal Nehru was the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the West Coast.

&gt;* ""Everyone who registers through the website till the last day of the registration process would be eligible for the computerized draw of lots,"" said Khande Rao Kand, convener of the Indo American Community of West Coast.

110,"Curfew, violence in parts of state amid bandh call

---

&gt;* The Centre rushed 5,000 paramilitary personnel to Gujarat after overnight violence rocked the state over an agitation demanding job reservation for the Patel community, forcing authorities to clamp curfew in several places and close educational institutions, officials said on Wednesday.

&gt;* The stir turned violent after Hardik's detention and clashes were reported in several parts of Ahmedabad, where police used batons and teargas to disperse protestors and control the situation.

&gt;* As tension mounted, chief minister Anandiben Patel tweeted: ""My sincere appeal to the people of Gujarat to maintain peace and not to indulge in activities disrupting law &amp; order across the state.""

&gt;* In a mega show of strength to push its demand for inclusion in the OBC category for reservation, the Patel community  led by Hardik  warned the BJP government in Gujarat that it will face consequences in the 2017 assembly polls if the plea is not accepted.

&gt;* Hardik's aide and Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti spokesperson Chirag Patel alleged police beat up protesters during Tuesday's campaign, and even some children and women were at the receiving end.

&gt; * Others wondered if DRDO should be involving itself in these things at all.The answer, could well lie in the fact that, for now, the organisation seems to be doing much better in making medicines and food supplements than mines or missiles.DRDO has been termed a laggard and its cost and time-frame outlay on crucial projects  unrealistic  and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged it to buck up during an address, asking it to finish projects on time, pointing out that the world wont wait for you. In these harsh times, it is herbal research and life sciences thats bringing in awards and laurels for the organisation.In 2010, it won an excellence award for its qualitative and quantitative changes in the way agriculture is practiced in the hilly regions of Leh in Ladakh.

&gt;* However, they returned after an hour, close to midnight, with a pistol and fired at Mr Kumar from point blank range, killing him on the spot.

&gt;* The youth then fled on motorcycles before anyone could react.The restaurant is barely 100 metres away from a railway police station in the area.

&gt;* Following the incident, locals agitated at many places in Begusarai and blocked many roads for hours.

&gt;* We are trying to trace them and will make arrests soon,"" said Jitendra Mishra, a senior police official in Begusarai.Earlier this month, campaigning for upcoming elections in Bihar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the rising number of crimes in the state showed how Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's government was faring.

This means whenever he comes up against someone who is sufficiently glib, he usually fails spectacularly. His interview with Modi? Modi had him in his back pocket all interview long. His interview with Kejriwal? He threw softball after softball. Jaitley easily handled him. His entire interview with Lalu was quibbling about some minor details and trying to get a raise out of Lalu who didn't take the bait.

---

&gt;* Tension mounted in Gujarat on Wednesday aftersix people were killed in fresh violence during a day-long shutdown triggered by a snowballing movement for reservation for the Patel community as Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for calm in the state.

&gt;* The government called in the army and imposed a curfew in parts of Ahmedabad and other major cities after mobs attacked police with stones and sticks and burned vehicles after 22-year-old activist Hardik Patel vowed to intensify the movement.

&gt;* As violence erupted a day after a mega-rally called by a Patel outfit spearheading the stir, cellphone communications were blocked in Ahmedabad to stop both rumours from spreading and gangs from coordinating their movements.

&gt;* Hardik Patel, who leapt into the limelight after Tuesdays massive rally, rejected suggestions that the protesters started the violence last night, saying police were trying to disrupt the movement at the behest of the political establishment.

&gt;* We can reach a solution through negotiations, Modi said in Gujarati in his first reaction to the stir that turned violent after the leader of the community Hardik Patel was briefly detained by police on Tuesday.

&gt;Modi’s haters are waiting for Emergency just like Modi’s fans are waiting for Achchhe Din.

&gt;And both these groups will latch on to anything that gives them a hope that their respective dreams – Emergency or Achchhe Din – are being realized.

And he IS right that Hardik Patel is getting way more attention than he deserves in political and media circles because he threatens Modi's dominance in his home base of Gujarat.

&gt;Hardik, who looks like a student unlike the FTII guys, has been able to repeat those scenes in Gujarat today. He gives Modi’s haters a hope that history will repeat itself, and their dream of Emergency returning would be realized.

&gt;This is the reason his demand of putting Patels in the list of OBCs – however illogical or unfair – will get support from Modi’s opponents. The Surat unit of Aam Aadmi Party had already supported him. Nitish Kumar has also supported him today.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The opulence of babas mushrooming across the country has caught the attention of the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money which plans to take a closer look at their source of wealth and its utilization.

---

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The government today allowed developers to divest 100 per cent equity in projects two years after the completion of such schemes, a move that can unlock investments worth about Rs 4,500 crore in the sector.The decision is aimed at fast-tracking contracts and implementation of highway projects in the country by making additional funds available for investment in projects.

&gt; * ""The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has amended its earlier approval dated May 13 for permitting 100 per cent equity divestment after two years of construction/completion for all BOT projects, irrespective of year of award,"" an official statement said after the meeting.The approval would allow the highway developers to use proceeds from the sale of divested equity in incomplete projects of NHAI or any other road projects besides any power sector projects or to retire their debt to financial institutions in any other infrastructure works, the statement said.

&gt; * ""This will result in physical completion of languishing infrastructure projects.

&gt; * This will also lead to enhanced economic activity.There are 80 such Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) projects awarded prior to 2009 that have been completed and the locked in equity in these projects works out to approximately Rs 4,500 crore, an official said.Once this amount is unlocked and re-invested in new projects, it could support 1500 kms of new highways on PPP mode reviving the response to BOT projects.In May, the CCEA had approved this comprehensive ""exit policy"" and as per information the PMO had asked the Road Transport and Highways Ministry to work out a modality in which developers are encouraged to plough back the funds through divestment of equity in projects.During the last few years, public-private partnership (PPP) projects have not been able to attract bids; one of the primary reasons being lack of availability of equity in the market among qualified bidders.This move will help unlock equity from completed projects making it potentially available for investment into new projects, said the statement.The CCEA in May had approved the proposal ""to make applicable...the provision of Model Concession Agreement (MCA) pertaining to the exit option for selected bidder/consortium members together with its/their associates...to all BOT (Toll) and BOT (Annuity) projects awarded till September 30, 2009, with the modification that the equity so divested, be invested by the promoter(s), in their incomplete NHAI projects,"" the statement said.

&gt; * Well over a third of investment plans worth Rs 10 lakh crore announced in 2014-15 had already begun implementation by July this year, according to a CMIECII analysis of investment projects from May 2014 accessed by ET.Over 90% of these investment plans were announced after Modi's ascent to power in May last year, signalling that India Inc's elation at the election outcome is beginning to reflect in boardroom decisions.

&gt; * As per the analysis, nearly 38% or 365 of the 970-odd investment projects announced during this period are already in implementation mode.In all, projects worth Rs 6.5 lakh crore, including those announced in the past and put on hold by promoters for a variety of reasons, have begun seeing ground level activity in this period.

&gt; * Of this, projects worth Rs 4.5 lakh crore have come under implementation mode in 2014-15, and investments worth Rs 2 lakh crore have started moving at the ground level in the first quarter of this fiscal, as per an economic outlook put out by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) last week.

&gt; * The number of investment projects that have commenced commercial operations has also seen an uptick, according to industry ministry data for disparate time periods.While investments worth Rs 96,000 crore became operational in the 15-month period between January 2013 and March 2014, the nine months from April 2014 to December 2014 recorded 209 large projects worth Rs 62,000 crore commencing production.New investments worth Rs 1.18 lakh crore were announced between April and June this year, taking the total tally under the Modi regime's first 13 months to well over Rs 10 lakh crore, double the investment outlays proposed in the last two years of his predecessor Manmohan Singh's government.

And how they are spent? Nobody knows. Yet, Modi is portrayed as someone saying 'na khaunga, na khane dunga'. Dude, you already ate your share. 

About plans and policies, we don't test policies. We implement them and when they don't turn out to be what we want them to be, we change them. Also individual party whims and personnel whims play a factor.

&gt; * Real estate association CREDAI's Rohit Raj Modi estimates construction in Noida employed more than a million labourers at its peak in 2013, at least double today's number.

&gt; * NEW DELHI, 27 August 2015  The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, announced today during the Call to Action 2015 Summit that Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) has been eliminated in India.

&gt; * India has shown strong leadership in overcoming two major threats to the prosperity and future of the nation: polio and now maternal and neonatal tetanus, said Louis Arsenault, UNICEF Representative.

&gt; * Indias remarkable achievement in eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus shows that by making a strong commitment to investing in public health their youngest citizens and mothers will enjoy their right to health, thereby making us all stronger.

&gt; * Maternal and neonatal tetanus is a disease that strikes down the poorest and most vulnerable, especially singling out women and their newborns living in areas with limited access to health services and poor hygiene.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was back in election mode but this time, he asked for votes for his counterpart in Bihar, Nitish Kumar.

&gt; * The two CMs shared a stage for the first time on Wednesday where Kejriwal asked Delhi's Purvanchalis to ensure their relatives back in Bihar voted for the JD(U) alliance.The show of solidarity came amid indications that Kejriwal might campaign for Nitish in the Bihar elections, a venture which will see him doing a political trapeze as the AAP leader will also like to keep a distance from the Bihar CM's alliance partners, Lalu Prasad's RJD and Congress.The two came with a common agenda for Delhi and Bihar, giving out a slogan, ""Poorna rajya ka darja Dilli ke liye aur vishesh rajya ka darja Bihar ke liye (full statehood for Delhi and special status for Bihar)"".

&gt; * Both targeted the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre with Kejriwal saying BJP was replicating its practice of negative politics in Bihar because of which it lost the Delhi elections earlier this year.Nitish, who was in the Capital especially to attend Delhi government's Bihar Samman Samaroh, also extended open support to Delhi in its demand for full statehood, saying that like Kejriwal, he was not a politician who would be satisfied with just the 'kursi' (seat of power) and wanted the power to do work.

&gt; * But by reaching out to Nitish through an event like this, Kejriwal further strengthened his base in the Purvanchali population in Delhi, whom he credited for the party's win, and also sent out a signal to other non-BJP parties and alliances that AAP is ready to partner on issue-based matters,"" said a senior party member.The Bihar CM lashed out at the PM for questioning the DNA of Bihari people in a recent rally.

&gt;* Earlier in the day, at a seminar in Patna, there was much bonding, mostly over the criticism of a common political enemy -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi.At the Patna seminar, the attacks on Modi were frequent.

&gt;* Bihar votes for a new government by November, and Mr Kejriwal has cast his vote firmly in favour of Mr Kumar, who goes head to head with the BJP in his state.The Delhi chief minister had earlier made an appeal - requesting the millions of Biharis in the capital to phone relatives in Bihar and ask them to ensure a Nitish Kumar victoryAt the seminar today, Mr Kejriwal said: ""Rs 100 crores spent on advertising for Swachh Bharat, has even a lane or road in the country benefited from this campaign?

In fact the same people who claim to be secular activists and make films on Hindutva generally steer clear of these topics.

I once got the chance to ask Anand Patwardhan(an activist filmmaker who has made several documentaries on Hindutva) why filmmakers like him are not touching the Bodo-Muslim riots in Congress-ruled Assam.

His answer was *'I'm not defending Congress but BJP this Modi that etc. excuses'* Basically just whataboutism.

&gt; * This fine balance has been upset because of the rise of Narendra Modi, who combined the planks of development, Hindutva and his own OBC status to help the BJP sweep much of North India.

&gt; * It might seem bewildering, at first glance, that within a year of Modi harping on his OBC origin for the first time in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the reservation issue has roiled the political waters of Gujarat.

&gt;* ""Mr Kumar, who takes on PM Modi's BJP in the state elections, has rubbished the package that the Prime Minister announced while campaigning in Bihar this month, calling it old wine in new bottle.

&gt;* Mr Kumar alleges that most of the schemes that the PM announced are existing plans being re-packaged with an eye on elections.He will believe the Centre is spending that money on Bihar when he sees it, Nitish Kumar has said.The BJP in Bihar is confident that the PM's announcement is a game changer and will give it a huge advantage in the assembly elections.In his announcements today, Nitish Kumar has focused on the youth.

&gt;* He announced a student credit card scheme worth 4 lakh for any student who passes class 12, saying students could take a loan from any bank and the state government would give a three per cent discount on the interest.The chief minister also announced an unemployment allowance for youth between 20 to 25 years of age and made ambitious plans for piped water supply to each household in Bihar and electricity to every home.

&gt;* Another reason which contributed to improved sentiments is the expanding list of investors from across the country that showed interest in Hyderabad real estate, especially the western corridor.

&gt;* Almost 23 per cent of the total respondents want to invest in Central Hyderabad because of ease of connectivity to all important corners of the city, including the western quadrant, after-work life at Banjara Hills and shopping hub at A S Rao Nagar.

&gt;* Once operational, the connectivity from the south part of the city to north and west would improve significantly and bring travelling woes to an end for daily commuters.

&gt;* Maybe the traditional sources of money chasing land and residences here are holding off, but in the long run, it's the only city that is not saturated, and at appealing price points with livable spaces.

&gt;* In a city like Bengaluru, middle income people cannot buy homes in prime social areas anymore, but that is not the case here.

&gt;* Playing with Patel sentiments is a too risky game plan for the goal of removing the CM, especially at a time when Gujarat is heading for a series of local civic body elections.

&gt;* More significantly, a demand for reservation by a community known to be financially well-off and socially influential actually shakes the foundation of the tall claims of Gujarat having been developed during Modi's tenure as CM.

&gt;* Patels of all denominations have dominated virtually all sectors of the economy in Gujarat, ranging from diamond polishing to textiles, groundnut crushing, cotton ginning, pharmaceuticals and real estate.

&gt;* Even in hard times, Patels in the diamond polishing trade could be trusted to splurge Rs 4 crore to buy the infamous suit bearing pinstripes of the PM's name, and save his sinking image.

&gt;* And, more importantly, for the last two decades, the community has been the BJP's strongest base, providing logistics, manpower, money and huge infrastructure for all the extravagant shows of the saffron party and its 'vibrant' government.

239,"There is also poverty, corruption, and illiteracy in Sub-Saharan Africa, and yet I did not see this level of callousness.  In Tanzania and Rwanda it was common to see people selling or misusing the diesel that was allocated for the clinic generator, or selling some medicine on the black market.  There was also absenteeism at an alarming rate and a terrible practice of taking a government job and selling the job on the market for less than the salary (as if it was property).  But what I did not see was the dismissal of fellow citizens as human beings, as was the case in India.  

I think that basically in India, people in general don't see the poor and lower castes in particular as being the same as themselves.  You see the same thing in the US, with the homeless and drug addicts.  People stop seeing them as human beings too.  However, in India things have gone a step beyond just the human reaction.  The treatment of humans as cattle is actually institutionalized in a myriad of different ways the healthcare and education systems work.

To give you an example from the non-healthcare space.  We saw many government schools where the teachers were collecting salaries and not teaching students.  Once my translator became so angry himself at a rural principal (a combination of being embarrassed by the situation in front of an outsider and just the general anger that any good person would feel) that he raised his voice and started asking questions without any prompting from me.  He basically asked  the principal if the guy felt any kind of remorse for taking money and not ensuring that the poor rural kids learned anything.  The principal said with contempt, ""why don't you sit here and try to teach these donkeys instead of yelling at us!""  Meaning to say, these were not humans who could be taught by any means ... they were just fit to work in fields in his opinion.

The translator was not from a poor family.  He was from a middle class urban upbringing in Patna.  And he was not unfamiliar with the rural situation in India.  And even so he was seething with anger.

Basically I think the problem is this.  Every new government in India tries the same plan over and over again, while calling it different plans.  Its been the same insanity for some 50 years.  They keep calling each rural program by a new name, but each program uses the same broken institutions to try to deliver new schemes.

I think the solution is to stop doing schemes through the government.  Just recognize that the institutions and people in Indian government are irredeemably broken.  They money allocated for government in rural areas should just be distributed to people directly.  They can then use the cash to buy services directly from private institutions in the villages.

I do not exaggerate when I say that a mid-level private school in India is as good, or better, than an average public school in an American urban center.  I saw many amazing, and yet relatively cheap schools when I toured urban schools in Hyderabad and Delhi.

The same goes for private healthcare in India.  Aravind eye hospitals in India are an example of the highest quality of healthcare delivered for FREE to poor people at a PROFIT.  How do they make a profit while delivering free healthcare to the poor?  Only an amazing Indian doctor with resource constraints could have thought of the scheme.  They basically provide free care, but charge for luxuries such as private rooms, TVs in rooms, etc.  The rich and middle class pay for options. The poor get the free care that is thus subsidized.

Aravind eye hospitals are an example of how the private sector could solve India's problems.  Check this out http://www.ted.com/talks/thulasiraj_ravilla_how_low_cost_eye_care_can_be_world_class?language=en

Do you know how much good could be done in rural India, if the poor could be given cash to purchase their own education and treatments.  Amazing chains of Indian hospitals would rise to take the place of the decrepit Indian public systems. 

And yet neither Modi, nor any person in the bureaucracy suggests this.  There is a subtle understanding between the bureaucracy and the politicians that their power comes from collecting the taxes and running large organizations.  They actually don't seem to have any desire to solve the country's problems if that solution comes at the expense of them losing money, power, or prestige.

For the most part, in all my time in India, I never saw much debate on Indian TV (at least on the English language channels) about the merits of doing this sort of dismantling of Indian govt. departments, and returning the money to people directly.  It doesn't seem to be in the public sphere of awareness as a possibility.

With India's new ID card scheme, it has become feasible to distribute money to people without middlemen stealing the cash.  I think people should consider this a serious election issue.

Other than that, I can't think of anything else to fix India's appalling problems.",2015-08-28 20:12:43

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Moving ahead on itsRs 6,000-crore 'Make in India' project for military helicopters, Russia has informed the Ministry of Defence about a partnership with Reliance Defence to manufacture Kamov 226T choppers locally.In a letter sent to the Indian government, Russia has announced an understanding with the subsidiary company of Reliance Infrastructure for the project, indicating that the company could be a lead integrator for the mega contract to manufacture 200 twin-engine helicopters for the Indian Army.While an option to partner with defence public sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has also been kept open with the final approval resting with the Indian government, sources said the Russian side has expressed keenness on a joint venture with under a new entity that could be named 'Reliance Helicopters'.The letter seems to indicate that a partnership that the Russian side had with the Gurgaon-based Sun Group  to execute offsets for an earlier version of the chopper contract  is now over.

&gt; * As reported, India has approved a government to government contract to manufacture 200 light choppers that are urgently needed by the Army for operations in high altitude areas, including the Siachen glacier.Sources aware of the matter said under the terms of the contract, the entire technology of manufacturing the military choppers will be transferred to an Indian entity and that at least 50% of the machine will be manufactured from parts sources locally.The Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Defence has applied for a license to manufacture choppers, besides several other military systems, to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP).

&gt; * Besides, Gautam Adani's new defence venture has also applied for a similar license.When contacted on the issue, Reliance Defence spokesperson said the company is 'actively participating in the Make in India program'.

&gt; * In the past, HAL has been manufacturing military choppers, while other players like Tata and Mahindra fabricate parts for foreign manufacturers.

252,"I don't think its true.  Population isn't the important factor.  Its population/area ... or population density.  If you want to be really academic, its not even that.  Its more like population/(natural resources) that should be the measure of the ""natural"" challenge faced by a society.

By that measure India is in a very good spot, despite its large population.  India actually has a lot of territory, and a large part of it has good natural resources and beautiful and arable land.

Countries like Japan and South Korea are much worse off.  Singapore is horribly disadvantaged.

If you go back far enough, say the 70s, or even before, right after Indian independence (1950s) India's population and resources were at even a better balance.

The problem is, Nehru and the psyche of the Indian people were tuned to building a giant, centralized state, to be run by a bunch of bright IAS officers.  Turns out, that plan was very horrible.  Indian culture thrives in decentralized places with a hands off attitude.  Indians don't thrive under despots ... whether those despots are British, or the Indian Government officers.  Indians like to build their enterprises, and peacefully trade with their neighbors.  But if you take money from them by force (govt. of India), and then distribute that money through the hands of the despot (govt. of India) then they will stop trying to build enterprises (because the despot will just destroy it anyway) and instead will try to work for the despot, or steal from the despot, or get favors from the despot.

There is plenty of land and resources in India.  The question should be asked, why is the land and resources being used so poorly?  Why does the Chief Minister of a southern state export billions of dollars of iron ore to China for processing in their steel plants.  Why is it that he doesn't give permission to Tata to build a steel plant in his own state?  Could it be that he is making a lot of money selling the ore, while Tata would not bribe him to get permission?  All those good steel making jobs are in China now.

Was it a lack of steel ore that was he challenge?  It was the way India is organized and the psyche of the people.

That same CM won the election by making various promises to the urban and rural populations of his state.  Promising various programs and schemes.  And that's all the people want.  They want govt. jobs, schemes, and programs.  India doesn't have the equivalent of a conservative party that argues for a shrinking role for govt.  It can't have such a party the way politics works right now in India, because every politician wants to win elections so he can dole out favors from the huge government pot.

The Indian government actually has Billions of dollars to spend on healthcare, roads, military matters, etc.  It has plenty of money.  Every year it pretty much wastes the money.  And its been doing that for some 60 years.

Edit: we had high hopes for Modi, because he promised a lot of transparency and elimination of corruption.  But so far, based on what I've seen in 2015, at least the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare is as bad as it ever was.",2015-08-29 00:37:58

&gt; * The fact that Hardik Patel has been able to organise such a big crowd, which only likes of Modi could manage in Gujarat earlier, shows that this feeling of injustice is real.

&gt; * That is why, for a 21-year-old brought up in urban India (no, Im not hinting at Hardik Patel; I dont know his socio-economic background), caste based reservations sound unfair and the post-Mandal injustice sounds very real.

&gt; * This could either lead to more reservations (as Hardik Patel is demanding) or abolition of caste based reservations (as the anti-reservation lobby demands).

256,"Nitish has been aggressively wooing Kejriwal for quite some time. In fact JD(U) was the first and only party to publicly proclaim support to Kejriwal’s campaign in Varanasi against Modi. Subsequently, Nitish rarely missed any opportunity to be photographed in Kejriwal’s company whenever he visited Delhi.

---

&gt; * The JD(U) bosss warm welcome to him in Bihar gave Kejriwal that occasion on the platter to introduce himself , which seldom comes a politicians way: &lt;em&gt;Bina Kharcha, Bina Parcha, Bina Karyakarta, Bina Mihnat&lt;/em&gt;, said a Mahagathbandhan leader.

&gt; * Nitishs allies, the RJD and the Congress, are not happy with the move, as also with his over attempts to showcase his friendship with Kejriwal.

&gt; * Ahead of JD(U)- RJD-Congress Mahagathbandhans Swabhiman rally in Patna on August 30, Nitish has taken a calculated risk believing that his allies may be feeling dismayed but till elections were over, they would not make it and issue or vent their ire in public.

&gt; * But, there are certain questions on which Nitish will have to work hard to convince his voters  first, how could he claim to be a strong chief minister, if he wins again, when he is contesting only on 100 seats in a 242-member Bihar assembly; second, how could he continue donning hat of Sushashan Babu (good governance man) when he is going to get sandwiched between lalus RJD and Rahul Gandhis Congress; third, what could be the situation if RJD which too is contesting on 100 seats get bigger numbers than JD(U); fourth, what does he stand for -- principled politics or ego driven opportunist politics  having quit on issue of principle in wake of humiliating loss in parliamentary elections and returning to power with help of Lalu Yadav whom he bitterly opposed for last 20 years.

257," The opposite of pandering to vote banks is not technical despotism, it is ""pandering to everyone"", or having policies whose benefits cut across classes, hence bringing you good will and votes. 


The left media can keep prattling on about how the BJP won because of communalism, an analysis that doesn't withstand basic scrutiny. If the Indian electorate was so fucking communal then that implies that the congress is communal too, as they were elected for 50-odd years, 10 of which just got over last year.
Maybe they should look at the news headlines with stories of their large scale corruption.

&gt; If anything the idea that India needs an intellectuals elite or technocracy to lead the nation is something commonly associated with the congress

Tell me more about the technocratic credentials of the Gandhi family ? What was the point of having MMS as the PM when the high command overrode any sensible reform he proposed ? The only reason he managed to get anything done in 1991 was the forex reserves crisis and the absence of dynasty figures with their *noblesse oblige* of ""I am pro-poor because I slept in a hut once"".


That said, the BJP government has been making a mess of things as well, Modi would do well to remember that its not the employees of Air India or the other anti-reform vested interests who brought him to power, but people looking for actual economic improvement. ",2015-08-29 06:07:54

&gt;* It is for this reason that the RSS never accepts other minorities as separate cultural-religious entities; rather, it advocates that all of them are several offshoots of the main branch that is Hinduism and to create a Hindu Rashtra is to correct ""historical mistakes"" and to mitigate the ""weaknesses"" which have crept in the body and soul of India and which in their opinion are the fundamental reason for the colonial rule for centuries.

&gt;* But this was also the time when a phenomenon called Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to the fore and stood in the path of that grand ""project"" which the RSS had cherished for so long.

&gt;* Starting December 2013 and till mid- February 2014, Arvind Kejriwal eclipsed the rising star and the hope of new India, Narendra Modi.

&gt;* It is the historical responsibility of AAP and Kejriwal to educate the people of India about the true intent of Modi and the RSS's agenda.

BTW this new AAPian spin about how BJP is some great satanic evil for all other parties to oppose reminds me of his *'Communalism is worse than corruption'* excuse in the 2014 election campaign. So that's the justification AAP and their supporters are going to use?",2015-08-29 15:53:27
280,"To me personally the AAP is a center-left party in a union territory. They probably have infighting, the usual politicicking bs common to other parties and perhaps too much idealism. Maybe in a few years they will get better, maybe they won't. They are still given far too much importance everywhere. I see posts dissing on them every day, I'm not sure why people care so much.

I honestly don't see any fanatical defense of AAP other than a handful of accounts, and most of the time they get downvoted to oblivion anyway. On the other end of the spectrum you have dozens of people defending beef ban, egg ban, defending AYUSH and all the other weird shit any normal person would be against.

And it's not just this sub or even reddit. The online internet hindutva brigade is very loud, very toxic and very jingoistic. I don't see anything even remotely comparable from the AAP, or congress. That doesn't mean they are better or worse; it's just that they aren't that prominent.

Try criticizing the BJP, Modi or the Sangh anywhere, and there's an explosion of butthurt. Shit on the congress of AAP all you want - most people won't even care. These people are very easily offended and defensive of indian culture, which is in line with what conservatives are general are like.

It's quite pathetic and similar to 'murrica republicans or muslim fundies.",2015-08-29 15:56:25
281,"&gt; The BJP isn't really even right-wing on economic issues. They're social conservatives. People who seriously think they are like libertarians or republicans in the US, or even conservatives in the UK are just completely out of the loop with what the BJP was like a decade ago, or the kind of politics they have historically pursued.

I agree with you, I have mentioned elsewhere, that India needs a real right wing party without the baggage of the Sangh. In fact if you read about ""Integral Humanism"" the philosophy of the BJP, there is little to distinguish it from Nehruvian ideas, except maybe they are slightly more to the right and mention ""Indian culture"" a few times.


&gt; Previous bastions of the congress are lost to breakaway state-level political parties that are even more populist and led by opportunistic thugs.

A bit of a generalization man, in my home state of Orissa, the BJD govt can hardly be characterized as ""opportunistic thugs"". In fact they are very pragmatic economically speaking, and have supported for years the sort of industrialization Modi talks about. Their approach to social programs is also very decent. The Orissa govt is also probably the only one to recognize that the solution to naxalites is not just getting the army to kill them, but two pronged: economic improvement as well.

&gt; BJP does it too, but I never see right-wingers complain about that.

Well, yeah, but as compared to congress pandering like Sachar Committee and Rajiv Gandhi's reaction to Shah Bano (which as per recent surveys 90%+ of muslim women oppose), its hard to call their stuff pandering to the right wing. Like what laws or policies would you call pandering to the right wing ?



",2015-08-29 16:01:50
282,"Yeah the BJD is good, it's exactly this way in Bengal though and a bunch of other states that used to be congress bastions. Orissa and Bihar are generally seen as success stories under patnaik and kumar.

&gt;Well, yeah, but as compared to congress pandering like Sachar Committee and Rajiv Gandhi's reaction to Shah Bano (which as per recent surveys 90%+ of muslim women oppose), its hard to call their stuff pandering to the right wing. Like what laws or policies would you call pandering to the right wing ?

I think token sops to the muslim community are a very small price to pay for relative peace and stability. Any attempt to force reform in their community would be seen as some kind of oppression. So it should be done stealthily or it needs to come from within.

Even the Modi govt hasn't really scaled back on token sops to the muslim community afaik.

Pandering to the far-right and the sangh is done in a much more creative way. Not only are they emboldened by Modi in power, you see frequent dog whistle politics. Putting RSS bigots in important positions in education, attempts to censor things that offend hindu fundies, looking the other way when violence affects minorities, subverting the judicial process of people perpetrating fundamentalist hindu violence, beef bans, egg bans, etc.

The thing is pandering to majority fascist elements is (imo) inherently far worse. Hardline Muslims are not going to be a major political force any time soon. For the most part muslims are relatively underprivileged, ghettoized and invisible. Hardline hindus however are in positions of power and privilege. Hell, you have yogis and sadhvis sitting in parliament. We are not a theocracy and having religious people in govt is just shameful.

Probably the same. And note that while the Gujarat police has shown textbook examples of excessive force, the protestors blocked public services for a week and did a LOT of vandalism and arson and damage to private/public property and are hardly saints.

The media has been giving this issue far more coverage than it should because it's in 'Modi's Gujarat'. There is a fairly clear agenda at work in the coverage because news trickling in from social media and my own friends in Gujarat says 

-Many Patel groups have withdrawn support to Hardik's agitation due to the politicization and violence that has resulted from it, photos from his rallies show that the crowds have thinned considerably over time

-CM Anandiben Patel has started working on a solution of financial packages for economically backward students from General Category; this is reported in Gujarati news media but so far ignored by national media

---

&gt;* Ahead of the much hyped rally being organised by Bihar Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United (JDU), Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and the Congress in Patna tomorrow, the BJP has put up their hoardings right next to those put up by JDU, to counter claims being made by the state government on various issues.The rally will be the first big show of unity after Mr Kumar and Mr Prasad joined hands last year, to defeat the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the upcoming assembly elections.The BJP hoardings have been strategically placed near Mr Kumar's posters which talk of good governance.Taking a dig at the state government's claims, the hoardings mention the youth migrating to other states in search of jobs, deteriorating law and order situation, and poor condition of patients due to non-availability of medicines at health centres in the state.In order to make the rally a huge success, Mr Prasad is busy addressing meetings in rural areas of districts close to Patna, asking his supporters to attend the rally.

&gt;* Mr Kumar has visited half-a-dozen districts, including his home district Nalanda in the past week, laying foundation stones and launching projects.One of the hoardings put up by the BJP near the venue, Gandhi Maidan, says ""kal tak ke jaani dushman, ab satta ke yaar hain,"" or how erstwhile foes are now best friends, only with the aim of staying in power.Undeterred, the grand alliance against the NDA says that the ""Swabhiman Rally"" will be an answer to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrogance and repeated insult to Bihar.In an attempt to consolidate their social base, both Mr Kumar and Mr Prasad have backed the protests by the Patel community in Gujarat demanding their inclusion in the OBC category for reservation in jobs and colleges.Earlier, PM Modi addressed three 'Parivartan rallies' in Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Saharsa in the state.

&gt;* He will address yet another rally in Bhagalpur on September 1.

But again and I have said this before as well, Modi/MMS doesn't call all shots. They can issue whips to their parties to support/not support a bill. And then there are two houses of parliament. One of the reasons that Rajya Sabha is a mess is because BJP has such numerical advantage in Lok Sabha that they can pass anything by whip. Irrespective of content or context, it is an issue of prestige for the members of upper house. BJP on its part, increased the hyperbole by refusing to accept this fact. And hence, we suffer. And I really want our political discussions to be more policy/issue centric than party/person centric. But that is just me and I know this doesn't answer your question as well.",2015-08-30 10:22:37

---

&gt;* The rally has been called by the grand alliance, comprising Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress to protest against the way Prime Minister Narendra Modi bruised dignity of Biharis.

&gt;* Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president Ashok Choudhary said Sonia Gandhi would arrive in Patna at 12.30pm on Sunday and proceed to Gandhi Maidan after a 10-minute stopover at the airport.

&gt;* To a question on the possibility of Rahul Gandhi sharing the platform with Lalu Prasad, the BPCC chief said the Congress vice president would address the election meetings to be organised by the party during the poll campaign.

&gt;* The drive launched by the party in different parts of the state is evoking tremendous response from the common people, who have been annoyed by hallow promises by Narendra Modi and his claims of bringing down the prices, said Choudhary.

&gt;* Slamming BJP leaders for auctioning the respect of Bihar, Choudhary alleged that the Prime Minister had stooped to a new low by indulging in politics of package to earn votes.

If we recall John Oliver's coverage on the Indian election campaign, it highlighted Modi mentioning that his regret on the 2002 riots was that he did not manage the media well. Maybe, just maybe, Mr. Modi should concentrate on fixing the ills rather than the coverage of those ills.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The government has decided to allow the land acquisition ordinance to lapse tomorrow and include 13 points in the rules to provide direct financial benefit to the farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today.

&gt; * ""We had brought in an ordinance (on land acquisition) which is lapsing on August 31, and I have decided to let it lapse,"" the Prime Minister said in his radio programme 'Mann ki Baat'.Observing that a lot of misinformation has been spread on the ordinance which has created a sense of fear and confusion in the minds of the farmers, he said the lapse of the ordinance would mean that the situation prevailing before his government came to power, would now prevail.

&gt; * ""Even though the ordinance is lapsing, these 13 points, which were meant to provide direct financial benefit to the farmers, are being brought under the rules effective from today so that the farmers do not face financial losses,"" Modi said.He said the suggestions to reform the land acquisition law had come from several quarters including the state governments.Referring to various social security schemes, the Prime Minister said over 17.74 lakh new bank accounts have been opened under the Jan Dhan scheme, making it a big success.Under the scheme, the poor can open such a bank account with zero balance, but it is of significance that over Rs 22,000 crore have been deposited by the poor people through their hard-earned savings , he said.

&gt; * This has been made possible by the hard work of several departments, ministries and banks, he said.During his 25 minute radio address, the Prime Minister also touched upon several issues, including the importance of Sufism which, he said, could truly reflect the great teachings of Islam as its message was of love, liberalism and peace.

&gt;* The editorial archly lauded Hardik Patel's actions, remarking that he had single-handed demolished that Gujarat was a peaceful state.

&gt;* Hardik Patel's rallies have cocked a snook at Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, who had invited businessmen from Maharashtra to her state, claiming that Gujarat was ""peaceful, stable and well-administered,"" the Sena pointed out, leaving no opportunity to take potshots at its numerically superior coalition ally in Maharashtra.

&gt;* At the same time, the Sena questioned the legitimacy of the Patidars' demands for their inclusion in the Other Backward Class (OBC) category, stating that the Patels' enjoyed the same socio-political status in Gujarat as the Marathas in Maharashtra.

&gt; * ""We urge those who lead Silicon Valley technology enterprises to be mindful of not violating their own codes of corporate responsibility when conducting business with a government which has, on several occasions already, demonstrated its disregard for human rights and civil liberties, as well as the autonomy of educational and cultural institutions,"" the two-page statement added.Among prominent signatories to the statement are Meena Alexander, Distinguished Professor of English, Hunter College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York; Arjun Appadurai, Paulette Goddard Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication, New York University; Shahzad Bashir, Professor of Religious Studies, Stanford University; Akeel Bilgrami, Sidney Morgenbesser Professor of Philosophy and Director, South Asian Institute, Columbia University and Partha Chatterjee, Professor of Anthropology and South Asian Studies, Columbia University.The views expressed by these academicians were dismissed by Indian-origin entrepreneurs in the Silicon Valley, who hailed 'Digital India' and said that India under Modi has finally woken up to the potential that innovation and technology can bring to the country.

&gt; * A government in India that espouses growth, development and entrepreneurship is well aligned to our mission of creating wealth and fostering entrepreneurship,"" he said.In their statement, the academics also raised the issue of Gujarat riots, and also allegations related to restrictions on non-governmental organisations, and freedom of media.

&gt; * ""Under Mr Modi's tenure as Prime Minister, academic freedom is also at risk: foreign scholars have been denied entry to India to attend international conferences, there has been interference with the governance of top Indian universities and academic institutions such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the Indian Institutes of Technology and Nalanda University; as well as underqualified or incompetent key appointments made to the Indian Council of Historical Research , the Film and Television Institute of India , and the National Book Trust ,"" they alleged.

&gt; * Therefore, since the Central Government considers it necessary to extend the benefits available to the land owners under the RFCTLARR Act to similarly placed land owners whose lands are acquired under the 13 Central enactments specified in the Fourth Schedule, the Government has decided to uniformly apply the beneficial provisions of Section 105 of the RFCTLARR Act relating to the determination of compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement as were made applicable to cases of land acquisition under the said enactments in the interest of the land owners.

&gt;* But doubts persist over India's new way of calculating GDP, introduced early this year, even though the method gained an endorsement from the World Bank's chief economist.

&gt;* Monday's data is expected to fuel hopes in New Delhi of taking the baton of global growth as China's economic slowdown deepens.

&gt;* The announcement came days after Sony Corp. shipped its first made-in-India television sets, and General Motors &lt;GM.N&gt; unveiled a plan to spend $1 billion to expand its main plant.

&gt;* However, the improvement in the economy is in large measure due to a crash in global commodity prices, which has cooled inflation and helped narrow the fiscal and current account deficits.

You are a blind supporter it is proved by eliminating the above statement in your reply.

Modi is a fraud that is exposed in the worst HDI parameters of Gujarat (took a state of that was 10% growth and ruined it). I would not be surprised if its claimed if he was the reason for Mars mission, UID, etc. If anything negative blame on international parameters and UPA, if anything positive its only because of Modi, the logic of a typical bh4kth. By the way Rajan has been there right from the time of UPA, no wonder he is an obstacle to sell the country to corporates for Modi and Jaitley.

Its fine, but let him come clean not decling RTI to even show his degree certificate. First time in history to have country run by a #1 shameless fraud PM.

One who does not learn from history is bound to repeat it. Elevating larger than life images only lead to sectarian strifes.. Our lion Gadhafi, the brave Assad etc which has resulted in crumbling Arab countries..

Modi/RaGa/Kejriwal also shits daily like us and smells as bad as ours. Exaggerating beyond normalcy of an individual blinds real issues at stake.

---

&gt;* Muslim outfits today objected New Delhi Municipal Council's (NDMC) decision to rename Aurangzeb Road after late President A P J Abdul Kalam, terming it as a ""deliberate"" move that is ""likely to set the trend of rechristening other cities/streets distorting history"".

&gt;* Ilyas, also general secretary of All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM) - an apex body of various organisations of the community, said the Emperor was not ""anti-Hindu"" as is perceived but ""a secular"" personality.

&gt;* Referring to former Orissa Governor Bishambhar Nath Pande's collection of Aurangzeb's farman (orders), Ilyas said the documents - in Persian - show the Emperor had donated lands for building temples.

&gt;* The decision was taken reportedly in the wake of a proposal by Girri who had also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider renaming the road to correct ""wrongs"" of history and had said it will be a fitting tribute to the memory of Kalam widely regarded as 'People's President'.

&gt;* Welcoming NDMC's decision, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had on August 29 said the Aurangabad city in central Maharashtra too would be renamed as 'Sambhaji Nagar'.

&gt;* Sonia Gandhis presence at Sundays Patna rally mainly served two purposes  it sent a clear message that the Congress is no pushover but an essential part of Bihars Mahagathbandhan or grand alliance and secondly, it galvanised her party workers who could gather at the historic Gandhi Maidan only after nearly 25 years.

&gt;* The speculation that the Congress had reluctantly joined the alliance due to its strong reservations against doing any business with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) had been doing the rounds in political circles for some time now.

&gt;* A section within the Bihar Congress had also worked overtime to ensure that Sonia does not attend the rally, arguing that her sharing the stage with RJD chief Lalu Prasad would sent a wrong message to the party cadre.

&gt;* It was only on Friday evening that she confirmed her participation, after much persuasion by senior central leaders and state unit chief Ashok Chowdhary, who had pledged a crowd of 1.5-2 lakh at the rally.

&gt;* And all these years, Bihar Congress managers had strategically kept the top leadership away from Gandhi Maidan, acknowledging that getting around three lakh people to the venue was not their cup of tea.
