0,"Yes... finally a nice non spin doctored view. 

To teach these people.. especially the Paki sympathizers and anti-Indians living and benefiting from Indian freedom and political stability the only answer is to annihilate them. 

Following the Gujarat riots the state was the fastest growing in Indian history. Hell true moderate Muslims love Modi because of the amount of wealth he was able to create... but lets be real no ""moderate"" muslim is going to live in a ""muslim-only"" zone where the riots were held. Only radicals or sympathizers were truly affected.. there may have been innocent casualties but that is what needs to happen.

The US is getting closer and closer with this every day to confront ISIS. Israel realized this years ago... that the Palenstinian Muslims would use their 10th child by their second wife as a human shield from under which to launch missiles at Israel. ",2015-01-27 00:01:18

The semantics of the insurance have not been worked out yet. Basically, false advertisement. But the false promise of insurance does not make it that bad. Reducing the KYC norms, however, does. But that was done in clear sight.

Edit: Oh, and lets not forget about the lies that he is an expert in spreading. ""We never sent notifications for compulsory attendance"". ""We never sent notifications for reducing retirement age"". ""We never sent notifications for this"" or that. Now that is not even white lie or exaggeration. That is plain blatant lie. 

Edit2: And as far as tampering with the countrymen's safety is concerned, it seems clear that Modi is going to compromise on that. The deal with US on nuclear energy is pretty ironic, considering that they themselves are not interested in it. Not to mention that they will have no liability. And 1500 Crore loan (that Indian insurance companies will provide, btw) is bullshit. It seems too small to me. A nuclear plant fail, like that of Japan, would destroy thousands of families and will make the area useless for decades. And hey, learning from History is bullshit (Dow Chemicals).

Their stances on taxation, subsidies, reservations etc. were made up as they went along and they publicly declared this (read any of the articles from during their 49 day government.)

BJP is a traditional party with traditional leadership and force-multiplied cult-of-Modi with anti-incumbency. There is no incumbency in Delhi other than Congress and AAP itself(?) As such, there's really nothing for AAP to criticize BJP about in Delhi.

You do realize that:

My Jesuit college held protest marches. 2 months later, in the byline of the 6th page (or something similar) - Orissa rape not religion motivated, 2 Christian tribals arrested"".

Incorrect. While Shah wants to win Delhi and will try hard, he has bigger fish to fry in Bengal and Bihar. And for that he needed to safeguard the illusion of a modi wave. Like the Congress with the Gandhis, he needed to protect Modi from the ignominy which follows a loss. And Bedi fits that bill perfectly. I called this the day she was announced. Bedi is nothing but a scapegoat for the BJP's expected loss in Delhi. 

Also, AAP's strategy of playing Kejriwal v/s Mukhi forced Shah's hand. People were beginning to understand that it wasn't Modi whose going to lead them but some clown from the state unit of BJP.

Same can be said about you. ""I believe in whatever shit AAP peddles. And this week it is casting aspersion on Bedi""

&gt;No. Expecting Bedi to be a good leader is just a gamble, not fact.

Its a much more believable thing than believing Kejriwal would root out corruption or he would even be a half decent leader. Because unlike Bedi whose has a good record in some leadership role, the only leadership role KejrU had ended in an unmitigated disaster.

&gt;Kejriwal is a gamble too, but he's no less proven than Bedi.

Already addressed that. Bedi has proved herself in a slew of leadership roles while Kejriwal is a failure (to put it mildly) at his one attempt at leadership.

&gt;He just has the additional qualities of charisma and being a good orator

""Charisma"" - LOL. His charisma doesnt extend beyond a few brainwashed/dillussioned youth who think he is a prohet in a torn shirt. And you must be the first person to think Bedi lacks charisma. FFS, she is a household name amongst the middle class than Kejriwal can ever hope to be.

Regarding his oratorical skills - just saying sab mile huen ji, sab chir hain ji, sab brashtachar hain ji doesnt count. Even a parrot when trained can do that.

&gt;The President of the BJP Delhi unit hates her guts and he definitely holds more clout over the party workers than someone who's been with them for less than a month.

So what ? The party workers arent going to administering delhi once BJP wins. And dont worry, Amit Shah and Modi who have reposed their faith in Bedi have even more clout amongst the workers than Delhi BJP president. So they will fall in line, if they havent already.


&gt;I for honestly believe that Bedi might have done more harm than good for the BJP

Lets see. I trust in the political acumen of Amit Shah and Modi and if they think, Bedi will secure them a win, then yeah she will win.",2015-01-29 00:48:02

&gt; The party was formed from the organizational machinery and name recognition of IAC.
&gt; Without IAC, Arvind Kejriwal would be one of the unknown 1.2 billion Indians and AAP just a unknown, faceless party.
&gt; Actually without IAC, AAP itself wouldnt have been formed.

Mental gymnastics and speculation.

&gt; BS. Without Kejriwal IAC would still have been IAC.

Yeah right!

&gt; Kiran Bedi, Anna Hazare, Gen VK Singh, Ramdev all had far more name recognition than Kejriwal ever had.

OK

&gt; IAC owes shit to Kejriwal. It is Keejriwal who owes everything to IAC.

OK

&gt; Oh yes I can - when a person who hates BJP suddenly starts talking about what is good for BJP, how it should function, then calling that bullshit out isnt exactly a not-to-do thing.

No you can't. Mind your own business - I will comment on the good of the BJP. You can take your khakhi panties and trishul and run all over India. I will comment and I will keep on commenting and I will comment so hard that you will get your panties in a twist.

&gt; yeah, its Ankit LOL supporters who have completed a PHD in Reading comprehension. One track tunnel minds who just parrot all over the internet what briefing comes from Kausambi and Ankit LOL shouldnt lecture others about Reading comprehension.

You can not either comprehend nor can construct a coherent argument. The max you can do (which is not much) is spew endless rhetoric laced with mental masturbation over Dear Leader Modi. The moment when you get called out your khakhi panties twists into your mouth.

Many people consider the slow environmental clearances for key projects as one of the biggest reasons for slow economic progress in UPA-2. Congress had tried to blame this entirely on Jayanthi Natarajan, she was fired unceremoniously one day before Rahul Gandhi's big FICCI speech where he is projected as a pro-corporate leader who has finally got the big bad Jayanthi Natarajan out of the way. This story was given much space in the media. Even Modi in his speeches used the term ""Jayanthi tax"" to allege corruption in environmental clearances.   In this letter, Jayanthi suggests  that her work as environment minister was closely monitored by Rahul Gandhi and there were many big projects that were blocked on explicit directives of Rahul Gandhi. Specifically she gives examples of investment projects by Vedanta and Adanis. Besides, she had always kept Sonia Gandhi herself briefed about all of her decisions. That is to say, the blame for slow environmental clearances lies with no one but the Gandhis.

So, the Gandhis used her to follow their agenda and orders, and when it is convenient, dump her and blame her while projecting Pappu as the saviour of the corporate world. Also, we Indians have been swindled off the truth about this for months.  

Relevant sections from the letter-

&gt;During my tenure as Minister, it was the clear and specific policy of the party, to take all steps to protect the environment, and carry forward the legacy of Smt. Indira Gandhi and Shri Rajiv Gandhi, to preserve the environment, and keep a balance between environment and industry. As Chairperson NAC, you have written several letters to me regarding projects in the Environment Ministry, and protection of tribal rights, and I have always kept you briefed that due care was being taken by me to protect the environment. **I received specific requests [which used to be directives for us] from Shri Rahul Gandhi and his office** forwarding environmental concerns in some important areas and I took care to honour those “requests.” **Shri Rahul Gandhi went in person to Niyamgiri Hills in Odisha, and publicly declared to the Dongria Kondh tribals that he would be their “sipahi” and would not allow their interests to suffer at the hands of mining giant Vedanta. His views in the matter were conveyed to me by his office, and I took great care to ensure that the interests of the tribals were protected and rejected environmental clearance to Vendanta** despite tremendous pressure from my colleagues in cabinet, and huge criticism from industry for what was described as “stalling” a Rs. 30,000 crore investment from Vedanta.

&gt;Fortunately, my decision was upheld by the Supreme Court. **The same happened in the case of the Adani projects**, where I faced tremendous criticism from within the cabinet and outside, for stalling investment at a time when the country was going through a difficult time in terms of the economy. **The complaints of the local fisherfolk and NGOs of environmental violations in the Adani case were forwarded to me by Shri Rahul Gandhi’s office, and I was told to liaise with Shri Dipak Babaria in the matter. Occasionally, I apprised Shri Rahul Gandhi of steps I had taken, and he responded positively. In fact you have yourself conveyed your concern in this regard in letters written to me.** In several cases including the stalled GVK power project regarding the Dhari Devi temple in Himachal Pradesh, the Lavasa project in Maharashtra, the Nirma cement plant in Gujarat and in several other cases I was given specific input, to make my decision. Apart from this Shri Pulok Chatterji, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister was in constant touch with me, and officers of the Ministry in guiding the decisions to be taken by the Ministry at that time.

&gt;So in my decision making I have factored in the party line despite all criticisms against me and therefore several decisions of mine were expressly overruled by the Prime Minister.

&gt; Beginning her campaign from Timarpur, the first hurdle that the CM candidate faced was malfunctioning microphones. While most of her speech at five spots in the constituency was dominated by “bahaut kaam karoongi aapke liye” (I will work a lot for you), it was MP Manoj Tiwari who stole the show, with the former Bhojpuri actor and singer breaking into song every now and then. 

&gt;An hour into the roadshow, as she made her way through Kingsway Camp, an Audi carrying lookalikes of Narendra Modi and Ramdev passed by and the crowd began chasing them. Bedi’s jeep was left to play catch-up. (LOL)

&gt; http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/slip-ups-mar-bedis-timarpur-rally/

And look at her behaviour

&gt; Just as Bedi, who was travelling with Timarpur candidate Rajni Abbi, was left wondering who these supporters were, Abbi’s relative, who was leading the jeep, came under the wheels of the vehicle. 


&gt; To onlookers, however, the scene was a little different. Barely after he was hit by the jeep, Bedi’s vehicle moved ahead not stopping to even find out what had happened. It was a while before a few supporters managed to lift Anjay and rush him to the nearest nursing home.

334,"Yes! AAP will even gain if there is a stalemate. With time prices will not come down and the initial charm of Modi government will begin to wear off. AAP will exploit every single mistake in another election in about 6-8 months.

Amit Shah made a huge mistake by not calling for elections earlier when AAP was down and out, around the Lok Sabha polls.

&gt;The BJP developed an inexplicable ambivalence in Delhi despite winning 60 out of 70 assembly segments in the Lok Sabha elections. Logically, it should have administered the coup de grace by holding the Delhi assembly polls in June 2014 when AAP was staggering under defeat and demoralisation. The BJP's complete inability to grasp the chance must go down in history as possibly one of history's best examples of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

&gt; Apart from the blunder of delay, which is likely to blot Amit Shah's all-win copybook so far, the BJP made three huge strategic errors that are simply unforgiveable. First, it ignored the mess and infighting in the Delhi BJP till the end. 

&gt; Second, the induction of Kiran Bedi into the party at the last minute now appears to have been a huge mistake. Not because she is a liability, but simply because there was too little time for the party to adjust to her and her to the party. Moreover, she appears inexperienced in electoral wordplay and seems a novice before the battle-tested Kejriwal. 

&gt; Third, Amit Shah is now belatedly pulling out all the stops by pushing central ministers and state leaders to stem the tide in Delhi by campaigning in the segments they may have influence over. While I give him full marks for trying to make a real fight of it, the chances are this will be seen as a panic move.

350,"Thanks for the reference to law. That would make it some sort of notified area, if I am not wrong. But I don't get this ...

&gt;Targeted by land mafia, attacked by goons and booked by cops, *Sikh farmers who had made the inhospitable terrain in Bhuj area of Gujarat cultivable*, are now forced to flee the land they had made their home. The recent attack on **farmers** on January 25 has only reinforced their fears and they have no plans to return anytime soon. Farmer Jagjit Singh was seriously injured in an attack allegedly by a group of local farmers in Loria village of Bhuj district. This was the second attack on Sikhs in Gujarat within a month. **Some Sikh farmers have alleged that local agriculturists in connivance with politicians want to drive them out of Gujarat**. This attack triggered the exit of a dozen Sikh farmers. Many have returned to their original hometowns in Punjab and Ganganagar after giving their land on contract farming. *Having sold their land*, most are virtually living hand to mouth now. 

Firstly, it would appear that they were farmers who owned the land otherwise they would not have been able to sell it off. And secondly, their ownership was in order because they were cultivating the land.

And Modi would not have made this statement, if he was not on the side of the law/aware of the present position and background of the case ...

&gt;In the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, Modi had assured at a rally in Ludhiana in February 2014 that no Sikh farmer in Gujarat would ever be evicted. ""Sikh farmers have as much the right to live there as Narendra Modi,"" he had said. 

It would appear that the law was passed around the same time that these Sikh farmers settled there. Which is why there is a mention of their fears of being uprooted from their holdings. They won the case in the HC but it has been challenged by the State Government, in spite of Modi's assurances, in the SC. The land mafia has jumped in, in the interim, to take advantage of a weakened position.

TOI was clear on most accounts. Yes, they could have cited the law better and given a better background of the case.

Edit : From the link you provided ...

&gt;“In fact, 454 Sikh farmers were given land in Kutch for cultivation by the State Government. The exercise of freezing the accounts does not apply to them. They are bona fide cultivators authorised by the Government itself,” he added. The issue was raised in August this year by the Punjab Chief Minister who was in Gujarat to attend the Vibrant Gujarat Global Agriculture Summit. Mr. Modi had then told him that the issue was a result of the Act brought in 1973 by the then Congress Government. He, however, had assured that his government would not allow injustice to the Sikh farmers.",2015-01-31 09:03:33

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to fly to the venue of his rally at a congested East Delhi locality was a “major relief” to both the local police and residents.

Both, however, “wished” he could have taken the same route back, if only to successfully be able to set an example for future VVIP travel.

This is the first time in the history of the city that a Prime Minister has flown to a political rally.

According to police sources, Mr. Modi’s decision helped save “hundreds of manpower hours” as it didn’t require pulling local police personnel off duty twice at Kakardooma, where he came face-to-face with the Poorvanchali diaspora for his maiden rally after the declaration of the upcoming Delhi Elections.

“He missed the chopper back by just some five minutes, because of which it had to be flown away without him,” a police officer said, adding that Mr. Modi’s trip by air didn’t mean that “relaxations were made in terms of police vigilance”.

Road expert Professor P.K. Sarkar termed the decision “judicious and intelligent”.

&gt;__Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana__ ([Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_language): प्रधानमंत्री जन धन योजना, English: Prime Minister's People Money Scheme) is a scheme for comprehensive [financial inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_inclusion) launched by the [Prime Minister of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India), [Narendra Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi) on 28 August 2014  He had announced this scheme on his first Independence Day speech on 15 August 2014.

&gt;Run by [Department of Financial Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India\)#Department_of_Financial_Services), [Ministry of Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India\)), on the inauguration day, 1.25 Crore (15 million) bank accounts were opened under this scheme.   By 10 January 2015, 11.5 [crore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore) accounts were opened, with around 8698 crore (US$1.4 billion) were deposited under the scheme,  which also has an option for opening new bank accounts with zero balance.

&gt;Who is going to question Kejriwal? The legion of 'activists' behind him and his party pretend they are immune to all criticism and innocent till death.

Anyone can question Kejriwal? But how much of the ""total"" power does Kejriwal have to that he can get away with such nonsense? Also it is widely know as a fact that industrialists own the media houses, and they have all the incentives to make sure that such media doesn't cover negative news about the government to extract favours from the government. The national broadcaster Doordarshan is toothless, they just recently transfered a guy to Andaman because he did a piece on Modi's ""wife"".

&gt;What can a Jan Lokpal do to eliminate corruption where our entire judiciary, investigative agencies, anti corruption bureaus, Vigilance Commissioner etc. etc. have failed? 

You need to read the bill in greater detail. It is in alignment with the anti-corruption movement views.

The problem is systemic in nature. We need to keep fighting against the systemic corruption that has made the government and bureaucracy rotten to the core. That's the only way the nation can progress. 

Did you know that Modi actually diluted the Lokayukta bill in Gujarat? 

I understand the bhakts complete faith in Modi, but past experience has shown that power without accountability in a land of censorship leads to drastic results.

The entire Opposition is united against the BJP. If that's the excuse for AAP then it's redundant. In fact they are tying up with the same Opposition, values be damned(Peace Party, now Communists).

&gt;Anyone can question Kejriwal? 

Yes, hence the response the party and its followers gave to Shanti Bhushan. Everything from 'we disagree' to 'He is the Advani of AAP, senile old man'.

&gt;But how much of the ""total"" power does Kejriwal have to that he can get away with such nonsense? 

Absolute power. Kejriwal IS AAP and no criticism against him is tolerated even by fellow AAP leaders. Or are you deluded enough to believe otherwise?

&gt;Also it is widely know as a fact that industrialists own the media houses, and they have all the incentives to make sure that such media doesn't cover negative news about the government to extract favours from the government. 

Which is why Kejriwal praised the media for their role in him becoming CM? Why they are aggressively attacking Kiran Bedi and the BJP? Why most journos seem to be rooting for the AAP?

Same old debunked excuses. I have never seen more rigid-minded people than AAP fanboys.

&gt;You need to read the bill in greater detail. It is in alignment with the anti-corruption movement views.

&gt;The problem is systemic in nature. We need to keep fighting against the systemic corruption that has made the government and bureaucracy rotten to the core. That's the only way the nation can progress.

Oh yeah. 'Da system'. Like Rahul Gandhi. Your clever-sounding words aren't even skin-deep. AAP has zero power to change the entrenched system, only make it more complex and compromised. 

&gt;I understand the bhakts complete faith in Modi, but past experience has shown that power without accountability in a land of censorship leads to drastic results.

Hence why Kejribhakts treat their icon like a god of gods.

See, this ignorance and the way AAP exploits it to their advantage is Kejriwal's main strength.

India has 'strong' Lokayuktas similar to what Kejriwal proposes for Delhi. But in the last several years the only time in living memory that a Lokayukta exposed a scam was Delhi and Karnataka, and in both cases the ones accused never actually  got charged for anything.

I had a discussion here with someone who implied that if a person resigns because there was an allegation on them from Kejriwal, that resignation raises suspicion. So basically you have a Honest hitman squad. They raise ruckus about someone, the party has to ask them stay away for a while till the courts clear the name and then that becomes the proof of their being guilty. 

&gt;He still asks about 15 lakhs that Modi promised. What was said was that the money will be enough to give every individual 15 lakhs. 

No one I know who voted for BJP talks about this mythical 15 lacs. This question is always brought up by the non BJP guys. No one has yet told me I voted for BJP because they promised 15 lacs.

* Total control, no bottlenecks in decision-making, leveraging synergies (whatever that means)
* No credit stealing (for example, right now anything the Centre does for UP or West Bengal can easily be claimed as achievements by the BJP's opponents)
* A lot of the things Modi has promised are under the States' purview. He can do almost nothing about crime, or leaky PDS systems, or large-scale land acquisition for industries/bullet trains/smart cities etc unless he gets the states to play ball. That would be easier if his own party (and his own people - all BJP CMs except perhaps shivraj and vasundhara) ran the state.
* Rajya Sabha

Of course, whether BJP being in power everywhere is good for democracy remains to be seen.

Speaking specifically about Delhi, it makes sense for Modi to campaign here because two-three rallies are insignificant compared to the amount of time and energy that he would have to expend on all sorts of issues Kejriwal can bring up if in power (dharnas, confrontations, some police stuff, lokpal stuff, I mean you know this guy right).

No it isn't. Despite the 2G scam, mobile penetration shot up manifold during the UPA regime, which was a huge boost for the economy. The 3G/BWA auctions fetched more money to the government, but the network rollouts are a sham and 5 years later, there's still abysmal 3G coverage outside the cities and BWA rollouts are limited to a handful of cities across the country.(BWA was supposed to boost rural broadband rollouts, and that hasn't happened)

I don't believe in religion, so I don't have that agenda and I don't think that BJP is as communal as people project them to be. But you must understand that every political party has to do something to propel them into the limelight. BJP used religious hatred once upon a time to do that. At the least, accusing others of corruption as a means to gain prominence is a far better alternative to what BJP did in the 90s.

&gt;BTW I'm sure Kumar Vishwas was fighting for love and peace when he made 9/11 jokes to the laughter for a Muslim crowd. Amirite?

He was a comic artist and offends everyone. So for that, you can't blame him for communalism. There was a controversy once that he said something offensive about Muharram and now there is a controversy that he is glorifying terrorism, I think its absurd.

&gt;The hundreds of stockbrokers, diamond merchants and businessmen whom Kejriwal has been wooing with sops for traders in the last couple of months. Have you forgotten so soon? Or have they become 'aam aadmi' because Kejriwal called them as such after getting their donations?

I don't think any one those fall in the category of industrialists.",2015-02-01 15:51:49
455,"&gt;Also you don't remember how aap was harassed from the first week if their reign for not keeping their promises? Not that it's the right thing. But jaisa political mahaul banaoge waisa paoge... 

If you make promises like 'We'll audit discoms in 7 days, we'll put Sheila in jail in 10 days, we'll build homeless shelters in 2 days' etc. you are obviously going to be mocked.

But in this case I distinctly remember Modi asking for 60 months. This time AAP has also wisely asked for a full term and kept away from the 'X days' rhetoric.",2015-02-01 16:09:09

&gt;We don't want to see a political leader trying to further his party's interests in various states. 

So if Kejriwal becomes the CM of Delhi again will you oppose it when he goes to other states to campaign for AAP?

It takes time and effort. 5 years, or 10, or 15. Not a few months.

And even after all that time with this much tangible work done it's thankless; your political opponents and their supporters will never honestly acknowledge any of this. Like AAP screaming about how in fact Sabarmati is the dirtiest river in India, or Kejriwal conducting an 'audit' of Gujarat and concluding Modi sat on his arse for 10 years.

That is why aside from the BJP post-Modi every other party in India just uses caste politics, 'secular' slogans or cheap accusations and finger-pointing and negative politics to get votes. It's quicker and easier to shout slogans and belittle other people's achivements than actually doing long-term work to slowly attain results.",2015-02-01 16:54:24

Addressing a rally in Delhi is not much of a distraction from his official duties, with roads being cleared for him etc. He could address a rally and get back in a couple of hours.

Also AAP have proven themselves to be capable of doing anything to stay in the media spotlight. I wouldn't put it past them for their CM to be out on the streets protesting some stupid thing or the other, whenever the central government has some crucial event planned. (If they couldn't care two bits about ruining Republic Day celebrations, they wouldn't hesitate to create chaos during other events.)

http://m.hindustantimes.com/sitaramyechury/nuclear-breakthrough-loaded-in-the-us-favour-at-india-s-expense/article1-1310908.aspx

&gt;
When the civil nuclear cooperation was legislated in 2010, the then BJP supported the Left parties demanding the incorporation of supplier’s liability. As the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, today’s external affairs minister had castigated the Manmohan Singh government on this issue, saying the prime minister had “betrayed the country’s sovereignty for his own prestige”. Likewise the BJP’s leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, today’s Union finance minister. After the Modi government was formed, the external affairs minister said on September 8, 2014, “Scandals like the Bhopal tragedy took place. That is why suppliers’ liability is already included into the Nuclear Liability Act. We will not pass any (revised Bill) …I think we will reiterate our stand before US President Obama. This time a strong government will be talking to Obama; that will make all the difference.”
&gt;
Betraying this, the Modi government appears to have gone ahead to permit a circumvention. Reports indicate that Section 15(B) of the Act will be interpreted in the Rules to enable Indian State-owned insurance corporations to offer a cover of Rs 750 crore while a government backup will extend this to Rs 1,500 crore. India will pay the premium for such an insurance policy to the foreign suppliers. What does this mean? Already the law caps the compensation to victims to be borne by the operator (Government of India) to Rs 1,500 crore. If suppliers’ defective equipment is the cause for the accident, then this insurance policy will be redeemed to increase the limit by another Rs 1,500 crore. The liability for paying compensation, hence, is completely to be covered by the Indian government and State-owned insurance companies, funded by the taxpayers’ money, while American corporates get away without any liability.

Addressed the Rally with focus on youth,informed the people they will have cadet police inside PCR Vans as learners about policing!

She talks about having Yuva trains which will take Delhi youth to Kashmir, Kanyakumari, etc. Which will bring youth from North East to Delhi.

We'll promote sports in Delhi. Sports academies will be opened in Delhi

We assure you that we'll carry out education awareness in the slum clusters

We'll try every possible thing to make PM Modi's dream a reality

Have included Modi's part for good measure: 
15:48: In politics people make promises and later forget. But, being a Delhi resident now, I'm all yours. Will fulfil all my promises, says Modi.

15:50: There's a competition going on between two political groups. The competition of spreading lies. They wake up in the morning and decide on what they will spread as lie today. Behind the curtain they join hands to come to power, says Modi.

15:54: Running a government is a big responsibility. Delhi needs a responsible government. Delhi has given me a lot. After giving me 7 MPs from here, if Delhi allows me to form a government here, I'll get the opportunity to serve the people here, says Modi.

15:58: Our opponents claim that Modi is lucky, that's why prices have come down in India. But even if it is because of Modi's luck then isn't going in favour of India. If Modi is lucky for you, why bring in those to power who will bring you bad luck, says Modi.  

16:00: Today I have the support of 125 crore people of the nation, which is why whenever I meet world leaders, I look him in their eye, says Modi

16:06: When I was contesting LS polls, people made fun of me. They said that I'll not be able to understand foreign policy. But those who understand national matters and policies, also understands foreign policies.  

16:08: I do not have theoretical knowledge, but I've the knowledge of people's mind. India's population is mostly youth, says Modi.  

16:12: Delhi is mini India. It is the pride of nation. Delhi elections are not just matter of state government, but Centre is also connected with it.  

16:14: Development is the only solution to our problems. We have contested polls on the agenda of development, says Modi.

16:15: Why couldn't poverty be eliminated from the country? Lot have been said to alleviate poverty, but nothing happened. Some politicians want poor to stay poor, says Modi.

16:20: Some politicians promised to regularise unauthorised colonies, but nothing happened. BJP not only working to authorise these colonies but also for providing basic amenities there, says Modi.  

16: 21: People suffer daily due to traffic menace in Delhi. Kiran Bediji has expertise in managing traffic, she will solve traffic woes, says Modi.

16: 22: Look at BJP government's track record in every state. Madhya Pradesh, which was once termed a 'Bimaru rajya', is now a developed state.   

16:23: Our one year has got wasted. Wasting one year of Delhi means we have gone 25 years back. We have to take Delhi to new heights. If BJP will come to power in Delhi, the representatives will have fear of Modi. But, if you'll choose someone else then there will be no one to supervise them, says Modi.

16:25: The dreams, that our freedom fighters had seen, will come true.  

16:30: Every person wants a quality education for his children and to have a home of his own. Do they not have a right to live a respectful life, says Modi. 

16:35: By the time India will celebrate its 75th year of independence, the poorest people will also be provided with their own house.  

16:37: Give me a chance to walk hand-in-hand with you and I'll take the nation to new heights, says Modi.

No specific compromise comes to mind. His overall tone is much more mellow compared to last time. Last time, because everyone was anti Congress, we all felt his tone was alright because BJp too was angrily attacking the Congress. This time, there are few deadlines. Fewer statements about Ambani and Adani. Smarter as a political party, and therefore more dangerous. Last time it was all extreme idealism and less pragmatism. But an idealist who has learned some pragmatism, he is a pain. As he can be this time.

No respect like last time. But its simple arithmetic. Last time, there were 3 choices. SOme of those who voted for AAP (middle classes, nobody can say what %) have shifted to BJP. Poor are still with AAP, easy to figure it out on the ground in Delhi. Congress voters have largely shifted to AAP and some to BJP. If that is a big enough number that can overcome the loss of the middle class chunk, AAP wins.

Underdogs can't be humiliated. They gain from every attack. Trying to humiliate him will strengthen his poor votebank, and the Congress' transfered votes - they will both be convinced that the rich don't like him, and the communal don't like him - and so lets vote for him.
