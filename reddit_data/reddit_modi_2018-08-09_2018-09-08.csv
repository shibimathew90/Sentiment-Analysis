1,"&gt; *“Through the means of this great and historic house, I am going to become part of ongoing process of nation building.”* That’s how Amit Anil Chandra Shah, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), began his maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha in February this year.

&gt; When Shah was elected to the upper house from Gujarat in August 2017, it was a turning point for him. Shah was no longer just the backroom ‘master strategist’, he was getting a front-facing role. He was no longer just the ‘Chanakya’ who won elections for his Chandragupta Maurya, aka Narendra Modi. He was going to become a part of the ‘nation building’ process.

&gt; ... Shah has virtually replaced Arun Jaitley as the voice of the government in the upper house.

&gt; ... Shah wants to outgrow the Chanakya image. He wants to be seen as a mass leader, an ideologue and, last but not the least, as someone interested in governance. 

&gt; **Soon after he won the Rajya Sabha election, a flurry of articles by BJP leaders and associates suggested there was an attempt to create a personality cult around him, similar to the one around the Prime Minister.**

&gt; ... His confidante Devendra Kumar, a psephologist, wrote an [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/amit-shah-he-is-more-than-just-an-election-machine/articleshow/60050193.cms) in The Economic Times calling Shah as “more than just an election machine”. The hagiographical article reads virtually as a charter of the new image Shah is trying to build for himself ...

&gt; Kumar goes on to build a case for Shah as a politician capable of holding public office: *“Shah has remarkable administrative and governance expertise – a quality that people outside Gujarat do not know much about. As a minister in Gujarat for close to a decade he handled important portfolios… As party president, he reportedly gives critical inputs to union ministers in his routine interactions with them. Now, as Rajya Sabha member, it is only natural that he makes important contributions in policy-making”.*

&gt; ... The conclusion is inescapable. Amit Shah, 14 years younger than his mentor Modi, sees himself as Modi’s successor in the Prime Minister’s office. That’s why he needs to be the voice of the government in the Rajya Sabha.",2018-08-09 03:18:07
2,He's no mass leader. Yogi has been spoken of as a successor to Modi. First I'm hearing of Shah in that role.,2018-08-09 03:22:17
3,"&gt; He's no mass leader.

Neither is Modi. Nor is Yogi. But you've already seen the propaganda machines working overtime to ensure that people consider them as one. And if Shah is really the brain behind (he does control the purse strings), I don't see why a PR campaign showcasing him as a ""mass leader"" should fail ...",2018-08-09 03:28:08
4,"Ya, Yogi's brand is still being built but I would demur about Modi. A large enough section of Indians obviously like him. I mean, if Modi isn't a mass leader, then who is?

There was a long essay about [Baba Ramdev in the *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/magazine/the-billionaire-yogi-behind-modis-rise.html) recently and the author hinted that he had Prime Ministerial ambitions. I never thought of him that way but he's probably a more popular and charismatic figure than either Shah or Yogi and he could likely make a run for the job.",2018-08-09 03:37:32
5,"&gt; In a note published earlier this year, Nomura's Alastair Newton points out that during a Feb. 23 rally in Assam, Modi called for Hindu migrants from Bangladesh to be assimilated back into India. He said non-Hindus should be sent back to their home nations. 

&gt; But Modi's seeming religious intolerance, his ambiguous stance on women's issues, and the implications of his rule on Indian press freedom(especially as Hindu nationalists take to the internet to intimidate Modi critics) are cause for concern. Those celebrating Modi's win should be cognizant of what his rule could mean for a democratic nation.

However Modi, like Indira before him - is clearly the only actually powerful man in the cabinet. This is because of the incredible fawning popularity that he has. In a parliamentary system - this gives him an inordinate amount of power which was never actually intended to be the prime-minsters.

27,"It would work better with a multi-party system unlike the hyperpartisan two party system. The US has weird presidential elections with the electoral college, the primary system etc.

Both major Indian parties are very similar on economic issues. There are the occasional shocks like demonetization and there are differences in certain fields, as well as implementation and effectiveness. But in spirit they are largely similar. For example, GST was in the works for the last 3 administrations. This makes the impact of a presidential system lesser than in the US, limited to only social issues and the occasional policy decision.

There are problems with a presidential system, of course, but for the most part, a system similar to the French system might be useful.

Right now we're tending towards a warped election process, where a vote for the local BJP candidate is inseparable from a vote for Modi. Congress is also trying to do the same thing with RaGa, they're just less successful at it because RaGa has the charisma of a wet paper towel and a major reason why people do not vote for Congress.

I know that a lot of people would vote differently if the Prime Minister's selection (basically a president) is independent of the local candidate's election. Hypothetical example: you might want to vote for Tharoor as an MP because he's done good work; unfortunately, his winning increases chances of RaGa becoming PM, so you instead choose the clearly inferior candidate.

Opposition Defeat Today Owes Much To Rahul Gandhi
Swati Chaturvedi
Published : August 09, 2018 14:34 IST
With the big 2019 election just eight months away, Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked the phone to win over Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik - his nine MPs - for today's big test in the Rajya Sabha. The ""united opposition"" was exposed as a shabby group once again - the NDA's candidate, Harivansh Narayan Singh, who is a parliamentarian from the party of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, won the election for Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman 125-105.
The opposition in parliament is a vivid depiction of the gang that could not shoot straight. After his show-stopping hug of Modi a few weeks ago, Congress President Rahul Gandhi appears to have reverted to ho-hum mode. He chose the lacklustre BK Hariprasad as the opposition candidate at the last minute. And for all Gandhi's talk of being willing to move the Congress to the backseat if that's what it will take to win over parties that don't like it (the YSR Congress, for example), he did the opposite. By forcing a Congress nominee as the opposition's candidate, the TRS, which had been lobbied hard by the BJP, voted for the BJP - exactly what Modi and Shah were hoping for.",2018-08-09 20:01:00

35,"Not really. It is not a matter of absolute power. One who has power should also have intent. Do you see any intent in Modi? He has absolute power. He is the Prime Minister of India. Where is the intent to curb all that I have mentioned? He is a spectator, a silent cheerer, an avid follower of those who advocate violence against women, against minorities, threaten them of rape, rejoice murder, heckle people and lynch them. Absolute power he hasn't yet. In his quest for absolute power, he forgotten his duty as the Prime Minister to stop the mob rule, to speak up against barbarism , to order the law and order to do its duty instead of trampling the victims of of terrorism of cow vigilantes. He may have ideas of fixing all these. Why is he sitting on them, if he has any? At what point of time and after how many lynchings would he decide to say ""Eureka""? When will he act?

40,"&gt; The BJP and the RSS are deft at twisting historical facts to suit them ... Modiji and some RSS “ideologues” have quite shamelessly been trying to inveigle the RSS into the Quit India Movement, when in fact they actively colloborated with the British regime.

&gt; The facts are thus:

&gt; On August 8, 1942, at the All-India Congress Committee session in Bombay, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi launched the Quit India movement. The next day, Gandhi, Nehru and many other leaders of the Indian National Congress were arrested by the British Government.

&gt; **The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) kept aloof from the Congress-led anti-British Indian independence movement since its founding by KB Hedgewar in 1925. In 1942, the RSS, under MS Golwalkar refused to join the Quit India Movement. VD Savarkar even urged “Hindus” to join the British military ... **

&gt; ... The British Government stated that the RSS was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them, and as such their other political activities could be overlooked ... The Bombay government reported that the RSS had not, in any way, infringed upon government orders and had always shown a willingness to comply with the law.

&gt; **As a part of the build up to the Quit India Movement on August 8, 1942, all Congress MLAs resigned from their positions in provincial legislatures. However, they were not joined by their counterparts in the Hindu Mahasabha.** The Mahasabha instead chose to boycott the Quit India Movement and collaborated with the British to gain political power at the expense of the Congress.

&gt; ... Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who subsequently founded the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the predecessor of the Bharatiya Janata Party, joined Fazl ul Huq’s Progressive Coalition as Finance Minister ...

&gt; ... When Mahatma Gandhi’s call for mass resignations came, Mookerjee, who was recently honoured by PM Modi on his 115th birth anniversary, refused to give up his position.

&gt; ... **Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, whose painting was added to Central Hall of Parliament by then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and who is celebrated as a “true patriot” and “Veer Savarkar” by PM Narendra Modi called for the Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to boycott the Quit India Movement. Which they actively did.**

&gt; ”While freedom fighters across India were chanting *“na ek bhai, na ek pai”* (not a single man, not a single paisa towards the British war effort)“, Savarkar, on behalf of the Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS, called upon all “Hindus” to join the British Indian “Army, Navy and Aerial forces in as large a number as possible” and to secure entry into “all ordinance, ammunition and war craft factories”.",2018-08-10 00:16:03

The government is a saint they can never do wrong. And modi is a fallen angel trying to fight evil and rid the world from the devil's influence. 

So people no proof means no need to think to hard . Just stay in your corner and eat some pakora fresh from our highly employed youth. No proof people no proof at all.

50,"RSS did participate, but secretly. It happened that once Nehru complained to Rabindranath Tagore that Geetanjali should be renamed to Srimadbhagavatgeetanjali or else he would join Muslim League.  This irked Tagore because the name was too long. He quit Congress and joined RSS. After that Bhagat Singh joined RSS because Bhagat Singh was a fundamentalist Hindu and because he said, ""Mandir wahin banayenge"", he was hanged. The British judge was secretly a Muslim. This injustice inspired Subhash Chandra Bose to join RSS. It is written in Amar Chitra Katha that when Bose met Hitler in Berlin, Hitler gave him 2 options: (a) SS \[foren\] (b) RSS\[desi\]. Bose asked what the extra R was for? Hitler replied, ""R stands for Rickety"". That helped Bose to make up his mind. Once Gandhiji also wanted to join RSS. But it was that Nehru who brainwashed him to stay in Congress. Even Sarojini Naidu secretly joined RSS during Quit India movement and wrote the following poems:  


My dead dream of India

In Praise of RSS

To the God of Pain in the Ass

Life in Sakha

Past and Future of Hindutva

Politics is dirty I'm not saying it has to be dirty but what we have right now. So either opposition has to take this asshole of a PM we got or he will come in power again. We are doing nothing just chattering in a ECHO CHAMBER you can spread awareness only where where is lackthereof calling Modi criminal on r/india will do nothing. Dude I know what a madman he is what can he do to make this country a HINDU-RASTRA I'm just sayin' we can't take him down Opposition can, they should not miss these chances, BJP already is in power

FUNFACT- that BJP in 2014 (asshole modi + shah) is the first non congress party to get more that 30% of popular vote but only with help of 12.5% swing if Shivsena betrayed them in 2019 then there is chance for opposition however now that most of opposition is united 2019 will be FUN,",2018-08-10 14:16:53

Stopping mob rule? If it's a Muslim mob, sure. If it's a Hindu mob, it has his blanket support. When will he act about the lynchings? Never. Why would he upset his support base?


As for your bigger point of absolute power - Modi doesn't have it yet. There are still opposition parties, the supreme court, chief ministers of non-BJP states, a shrinking but still alive free press, a few intellectuals, some people who call him out online, the professional and secular army, the secular constitution, and last but not the least, world opinion. If all the these factors were not there, then Modi would have absolute power, and then RSS would have been able to turn India into a fascist Hindu theocracy.

Going off on a tangent: We are slowly moving in that direction, but are not there yet. We can still influence the events and create a better future. The best time to act was 5 years ago. The second best time to act is TODAY, because the next general elections are coming in 9 months. If we keep postponing activism until it is convenient, until we ""have time"", etc., 9 months will zoom by and we will find ourselves having to endure another 5 years of BJP's absolute majority.

&gt;Here is the lending criteria from [the same bank](https://www.kalupurbank.com/working-capital-facilities.html). Still hard to see how with properties of 7cr + stocks/goods ( inventories) of 9 cr ( in 2016) + book debt (?) could lead to a loan of 40 cr, and there is an explanation beyond Jay Shah's business acumen.

Eh? The reportor posted a picture of a factory premises. Didn't look shabby and into manufacturing of plastics. I am not in that industry of plastics for me to claim that they have that kind of inventory in 2017. The article doesn't refer to anything about violating the norms of this co-op bank. Also listed shares were pledged (for a different loan I think) - also given in article.


&gt;
&gt;It would be naive to think that Suzlon will not do their own background check before engaging just because they are being hired. Client-supplier due diligence works both ways. If I own a stock company today and go to Suzlon asking for installing and maintaining wind farms, you think they will do it, just because I say I will be paying them and they will be getting some tax advantages? Pretty sure it takes more than that.

If you have capital (equity + debt), suzlon would do it for you. In the past, suzlon and others used to go to everyone and offer the same. That is the reason why a heavy machinery company in Mulund and fertilizer company in Hyderabad has wind farms in south TN. This is my industry (infrastructure). 

Wind farms have 80% depreciation on the first two years - or 96% of the capital cost can be expensed off in 2 years despite life of 20 years. It's tax saving. 


&gt;But they do have assets which the banks can seize. Banks also look at management expertise before extending loans. Also, even if companies isolate the project by making a new SPV, it does not mean that lenders don't look at previous track records. Moreover Jay Shah's company does not satisfy any of these criteria, the company's assets were 2 lakhs in 2016.

He has other companies and no record of default. In the wind farm, he put equity of around 3crs - which is in the same company. The income from this company in the [wire hit piece was 24 crs in 2015](https://thewire.in/business/amit-shah-narendra-modi-jay-shah-bjp) with ICD of another 4.9 crs. Surely, assets of 2 lakhs is the odd number (how assets of 2 lakhs is possible with a 14+cr wind farm + a factory?). The article also has a picture of factory which is definitely worth a few crs in the worst case scenario. FYI, the wire article mentions that 25crs ""loan"" was a letter of credit, not actual disbursal.



&gt;That's a rather poor argument. My point was not whether it has breached the limit of 75% but the credentials Jay Shah's company has to secure a loan of this magnitude. D/E above 50-60% in project finance is regarded as high risk. And no lender will give it to a company with 0 expertise and past record in this field, and that too a government body.

No wind or solar or coal based power plant or road project (most anyways - some idiots could have tried and failed)will be built with 60% D/E. Previously, it was 80% but banks after the bad loans issues have gone down to 70% - 75%. The cost of equity will kill viability of any sustainable tariff along with the fact that interest is an expense according to tax laws (CoE is not). Even the old cost plus tariff models (ie govt pays all your costs + returns) had a restriction of at least 70% or 75% D/E - if a company builds a plant with 60% D/E, tariff authority will assume 70%-75% D/E and give CoE on the 25%-30% equity component (not the 40% actual).",2018-08-10 19:16:31
76,"&gt; He is not RSS material. His saffron agenda may align with what RSS wants, but he is a wild card who is not under the control of RSS and hence BJP.

You are very wrong. It was the RSS that ensured that he became the UP of CM. Modi and Amit Shah wanted their own man, but he didn't back down. He could take on Modi and Amit Shah only with the backing of the RSS.

Here the spin doctor does not look at the crime "" loss of free journalism, right to criticise a public figure"" by government action of taking advertising forcing government bureaucrats to pressure media houses, unsanctioned use of blackouts, dedicated monitoring teams to censor journalists. Here the spin doctor points the finger at a journalist who was a victim of a crime perpetrated by the government on the same journalist who faced the exact same tactic employed by the government.

This is fucking mind blowing thinking that these people have the audacity of blaming the victim of a crime. Pathetic  to the rotten core. This is your India people, understand very well that these people are driven by hate and greed. These people can never be anything but good. They will twist and plot like a cockroach hiding in the cracks. Their agenda is clear derail a discussion undermine the core issue by misdirecting to a victim , rather than being logical and demanding a investigation into these claims, which can prove everything. These people will try to burry the issue using these tactic because they too know that modi is doing this and they are fine with it. They don't mind as long as they are the chosen people. Because for them the government will protect them and for them what the government is doing is great because it satisfies their dark fantasy of hurting people they view as historical enemies, both different from each other religiously.

80,"This is quite a common query on this sub. At the moment, my browser toolbar has the following websites: *Newslaundry, Arré, OPEN, Outlook, Scroll, ThePrint, Caravan* and *The Quint*.

I look for content on topics that interest me. *Arré* has excellent personal essays and articles by young Westernised Indians about the problems they face in daily life. It's my favourite website. *Newslaundry* has great video interviews with prominent personalities. Their written content rarely speaks to me. *OPEN* has excellent articles and essays on a variety of subjects from authors across the ideological divide. It could be anything from the genetic history of Indians to the ugly Indian tourist to Zareer Masani's defence of the British Raj. Their website is well-designed and aesthetically pleasing. *Outlook* also is an all-round publication like *OPEN* and has been around for a long time. It's pretty much a fixture of the Indian media. It again has a Westernised sensibility that I enjoy. Individual pages are fine but their homepage is quite confused and aesthetically uninviting. *Scroll* has come up recently and covers a a diversity of topics from news, personal perspectives, ecology and nature, history as well as articles curated from Western sources. Haroon Khalid, a Pakistani usually writes for them about the situation of minorities in Pakistan. It has a very Catholic approach just like the other publications I have listed. *ThePrint* has slightly shorter pieces and is more focused on news and current affairs and their website isn't as attractive as the rest. However, it's Shekhar Gupta's latest venture and he is such a power player in Delhi, you can't really afford to ignore him. Jyoti Malhotra had a nice piece on there recently about how Jaitley has been sidelined by Modi. You didn't see that anywhere else. *The Caravan* was launched or rather re-launched in 2009 I think and has been the go-to place for essays and long-form articles since then. It has stood the test of time. Indian journalism is usually quite short on length and it's refreshing to see at least one publication that insists on going in-depth. *The Quint*, which is Raghav Behl's venture is also a good mixture of video interviews, explainers, personal perspectives, news and op-eds.

84,"&gt; FEW national leaders are as careful of their image as Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister. He is said to change clothes as often as four times a day ... The boosting of Mr Modi’s image is not just down to dress sense. Since taking office in 2014 his government has spent some $500m on advertising ... The 21 state governments run by his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, may have spent similar sums.

&gt; ... All this image-making is carefully controlled. The prime minister makes few unscripted appearances. He does not bring journalists along when he travels. In a break with tradition, he has never held a press conference.

&gt; ... As it is, media analysts say, much of India’s press is too dependent on advertising from the government, or from friends of the ruling party, to be really critical. This is especially true of television. 

&gt; ... The recent fate of three senior staffers at ABP News, a Hindi channel, illustrates the perils. the channel’s satellite feed began to experience strange interference precisely during this programme’s airtime. A big advertiser, known for close ties to the ruling party, pulled out. The channel’s ratings fell. Told by the management to drop any reference to Mr Modi, two top staffers quit. A third was sent on extended leave. As soon as they were gone, claims a letter from the programme’s now-unemployed anchor, the technical problems vanished, and advertisers returned. Easy as changing clothes.",2018-08-10 23:59:55

Yogi had backing of RSS. He got the RSS stamp, he got them hard and wet. That is where things end.

 He is not an RSS guy/pracharak.  See the difference here ? You might want to look up how many years one needs to be working as a RSS worker to earn that level of trust. How many years Modi toiled vs Yogi's direct contribution to sangh. There is a difference here. Sangh is something else, and Yogi is something else. The only common factor of safron does not makes him a sanghi.  

You might also want to lookup on the actual reason for Yogi being UP CM. Although he has RSS blessing , the background is threats and blackmails to BJP on siding with SP.

86,"&gt; The article doesn't refer to anything about violating the norms of this co-op bank. Also listed shares were pledged (for a different loan I think) - also given in article. 

The article mentions that in the deed of hypothecation, the schedules pertaining to the firm’s stock, book debts and machinery have been left empty which is dubious. And that's the whole point of the article as well as as the wire article. The total loans raised till date along with the wind farm is 97.4 cr and raises the question as to how come a company with ever changing businesses and poor financial records, is able to access loans to this tune, get government projects, land and funding with absolutely no merit or experience?

&gt; He has other companies and no record of default. In the wind farm, he put equity of around 3crs - which is in the same company. The income from this company in the [wire hit piece was 24 crs in 2015](https://thewire.in/business/amit-shah-narendra-modi-jay-shah-bjp) with ICD of another 4.9 crs.  Surely, assets of 2 lakhs is the odd number (how assets of 2 lakhs is possible with a 14+cr wind farm + a factory?). The article also has a picture of factory which is definitely worth a few crs in the worst case scenario. 

Not defaults, but Kusum Finserve has been running at losses from FY13 to 16. He closed his company Temple Enterprise Pvt. Ltd and earlier Sattva Tradelink. For this track record, even his relatives would not lend him money, let alone banks.

The 2 lacs figure seems odd, but you cannot add an asset of 14 cr for a wind farm on day 1. It will be reflected later with time. And even for a company with 14 cr assets (which is still not yet verified), the loan of 97 cr seem disproportionate which both the articles point out.

&gt;FYI, the wire article mentions that 25crs ""loan"" was a letter of credit, not actual disbursal. 

And the same bank extended the LOC to another 15 cr, which means the original 25 cr was already disbursed.

&gt; No wind or solar or coal based power plant or road project (most anyways - some idiots could have tried and failed)will be built with 60% D/E. Previously, it was 80% but banks after the bad loans issues have gone down to 70% - 75%. The cost of equity will kill viability of any sustainable tariff along with the fact that interest is an expense according to tax laws (CoE is not). Even the old cost plus tariff models (ie govt pays all your costs + returns) had a restriction of at least 70% or 75% D/E - if a company builds a plant with 60% D/E, tariff authority will assume 70%-75% D/E and give CoE on the 25%-30% equity component (not the 40% actual). 

Again, that works for companies which have a past track record. Sure a company with expertise and track record can take on 75% debt. D/E is determined by the risk level of the project and depends on a number of factors, track record being a critical one. For riskier projects, lenders take a maximum exposure, so even if they feel 75% is manageable, they will take exposure to only 50% and ask the company to arrange another debt for the rest. And I am pretty confident that a company with business in stocks, plastics, import, export, sale of agricultural products, marketing consultancy (anything I missed?) and anything but infrastructure, will be classified as anything other than high risk, to be given a loan at 75% D/E.",2018-08-11 00:06:15

I remember, long ago during a discussion, my own uncle tried to justify murders and rapes of innocents in Gujarat in 2002, as he believed Muslims needed that lesson after the Godhra train burning. His son, my cousin defends Kathua incident with his conspiracy theories. While growing up, I was fed lots of RSS propaganda by my relatives, I even attended RSS Shakhas. Of course, they failed and could not corrupt my conscience. 

I was born in India and I'll die there. So wherever I'm, I follow Indian news. 

Now, coming back to my question - a lot of things that I mentioned in my question, such as an ineffective judiciary, crimes against women and a highly corrupt police force, are not a new development. The present government can not be completely blamed for such things. On the other hand, it appears that hate machinery and fake news factory on social media at this scale is unprecedented. It lead to a general atmosphere of distrust and xenophobia, and so the recent terrifying mob lynchings can certainly be attributed, either directly or indirectly, to the ruling party and its cohorts. Attacks on an independent media and compromising the sanctity of the supreme court are matters of great concern. If unchecked these things will have long term ramifications. But I want to know if this high handedness of  the government has directly affected your life? If you have Muslim friends, are they really terrified?

I left it long ago because of that. My parents thankfully are the saner bunch. My dad has his senior(again, a modi bhakt) called him out just for liking something critical of Modi once, since then he stay clear off fb mostly. You can't be outspoken in public about anything critical of Modi &amp; Co. without fear of getting abused, beaten up or lynched, bonus points if you're a Muslim. There's no 'attack on media' anymore, media has been systemically compromised and we're not even in an official emergency. This makes things worse. People are being fed propaganda and lies. All this is still suppressed from worldwide attention. It's going to take its full shape when they win 2019.

* When the Godhra train-burning incident occurred in 2002, Modi was Gujarat's Chief Minister, while Haren Pandya was Gujarat's Home Minister.

* Pandya testified before a tribunal that after the Godhra attack, Modi instructed Gujarat's police to stand down and allow a ""Hindu reaction"" to take place. Over the next few days, Gujarat burned in the infamous riots.

* After this, Modi was furious with Pandya, and forced BJP's leadership to deny Pandya a ticket for the Gujarat assembly elections, which were due in a few months.

* Soon afterwards, Pandya was shot dead while on his morning walk. It is alleged that he was killed on Modi / Amit Shah's behest.

154,"&gt; **Much to its own surprise and embarrassment, the BJP found itself in the awkward position of being forced to vote against a resolution to ensure that Dalits are treated equally all over the country ... Unwittingly, the ruling party vindicated the Opposition charge that the Modi government is anti-Dalit.**

&gt; The problem cropped up when Nishad insisted on a vote. Normally, such non-official Bills and Resolutions are withdrawn by the Member who moves them. But on this occasion,  the Samajwadi Member insisted that it should be put to the vote.

&gt; Deputy Chairman Harivansh proceeded to ask for a voice vote - and, as expected, declared that it had been ‘negatived’.

&gt; However, Nishad and some others demanded a ‘Division’, which means actual voting that is recorded and tallied. The Deputy Chairman went right ahead and ordered the “lobbies to be cleared” and set the voting process rolling.

&gt; There were howls of protest from the Treasury benches. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad jumped to his feet and raised objections ... Social Justice Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot joined his Law Minister in saying that only Bills are put to the vote and not Resolutions.

&gt; It was too late. Acting on the advice of the Secretary-General, the Deputy Chairman ruled that since he had already ordered the lobbies to be cleared, the  voting process had effectively been started and could not be stopped.

&gt; There was no way out. Electronic voting took place. The result was 32 in favour of the Resolution and 66 against.  **The Private Member’s Resolution had been defeated – but there were red faces on the Treasury benches for having voted against ensuring equal treatment of Scheduled Caste citizens in all the States of the country and bringing
about a uniform reservation system free of discrimination.**

&gt; What the Resolution sought was to provide standard and uniform norms to end discrimination. **Basically, the need is to ensure that persons belonging to SC/ST category in one State should be treated as belonging to that SC/ST category all over the country.**

&gt; All political parties across the ideological spectrum agree to this. **But the BJP voted against it on the floor of the Rajya Sabha** - much to the delight of the Opposition parties.

&gt; Since you mentioned ""interconnect fabrics"", and I am speculating from the POV of high performance computing...what are the prospects of RISC based systems for taking over the next generation of hardware?

From /u/mynameissomethingtoo

&gt; Congratulations to you guys.

&gt; This is unrelated, but would you like to comment on the Spectre and Meldown vulnerabilities recently detected in Intel chips? Can you guys dumb down what exactly had happened and why was everyone freaking out?

From /u/Modi-iboM

&gt; Questions, because I will surely miss the time slot:-

&gt; 1) Any timeline of when we will see these processors on a motherboard?

&gt;2) Can we see DMESG output?

&gt;3) When should we expect Indian supercomputer with these chips running? Will Intel withhold their facilities when they come to know that these chips will be used for supercomputing purpose? Can Taiwanese fabs be roped in at that time?

From /u/dylan522p

&gt; Why are you using Intel 22nm FFL over a more standard Fab for a first tapeout/model, such as TSMC 28nm?

From /u/innovator116


&gt; I am emphasizing here as I have said globally, that RISV-V will need small scale semiconductor fabs model to become ubiquitous. When small groups will not just be able to implement RISV-V based microprocessors but manufacture them as well locally.

&gt; My question is, has the IIT-M team has reached out to IISc groups working on nanopatterning lithography technologies? A national consortium to design, develop and manufacture ICs domestically is need of the hour.

&gt; Proprietary hardware is bound to contain backdoors for Americans or Chinese.

From up-sky-7

&gt; Do you plan on releasing everything as FOSS (100% Libre), even the GPU?

From /u/kipboye

&gt; Hey there!

&gt; First off, great job and congratulations!

&gt; What advice would you give to a 2nd year student who loves processors and wants to learn how to build them? Where would you have me start with this and what resources (books, software, etc.) are available?

&gt; Thanks in advance!

From /u/pcein

&gt; Great to see the amazing work you are doing, and thanks for the AMA! A few questions:

   &gt; Can a hobbyist like me try out the SHAKTI processor on an FPGA dev board (like the Zedboard)?
    You mentioned a ""Rust based OS"" for supporting tagged ISA's in a recent HN post. Are any details regarding this available?
    At the moment, SHAKTI seems like a mostly IITM-only project - any plans on getting the FOSS community involved in it to a greater extend?

3) Ask Delhi Police to sincerely investigate the shooting on Khalid, and motive behind the shooting. If Delhi Police is incompetent, ask home ministry to hand the inquiry to the CBI

4) Ask partymen and RSS to publicly condemn  the people who threaten reporters such as Ravish Kumar, Abhisar, etc ; Ask home ministry to investigate these people and make sure appropriate legal actions are taken by the government

5) Instead of refusing to send representatives to the anchors and news channels that criticize Modi and his government and only sending to those who favor him and his government, he could send representatives to all or none; this will show that Modi can take criticism and the representative can actually debate about their work in non-biased environment at the best or in unfavorable environment at the least.

264,"Indian Independence Day is that 1996 movie when aliens try to attack India and specifically Indian Parliament, but stop when they realize that Indians are doing a very good job of it themselves.  The mothership hovers over the Prime Ministers' house (Lok Kalyan Marg) and is about to destroy it with a beam of intense energy, when Narendra Modi climbs to the roof and places his metal cow statue at the center of it, in an effort to ward them off with its religious power.  The beam hits the cow, which absorbs all the energy and heats it, giving it an intense glow.  The aliens, confused, leave...leading Narendra Modi to have renewed strength and faith in the Gaumata (Cow Mother), accepting the victory as a sign of his divine right to rule, and thus pushing his religious agendas even further.  The world congratulates Modi for saving it, with governments donating vast sums of money for India's urban development.  But predictably, the politicians hoard most of it and only give token amounts to public spending.  Also, the Indian RAW (Research and Analysis Wing, similar to the western Secret Service) discovers at this time that during the recent attack, the alien mothership had secretly deployed dozens of shape-shifting aliens in India, to learn more about human life.  This leads to the formation of the MIB (Men in Bhakts) - where RAW agents pose as religious and devotional leaders so they can spy on accused aliens unsuspectingly.  This leads to a spinoff movie where special agents Jai and Kher are tasked with locating and incapacitating the aliens, using top secret, government-researched poojas and mantras, 'blinding' them with their religious zeal and thus overriding their memory.

*""The behavior of sections of the Indian media over the past few decades has an eerie similarity to the behavior of Der Stürmer and Kangura in the run-up to violence, ethnic killings, and genocide. The sinister parallels were evident in the 2002 Gujarat. A study by PUCL in 2002 found that two vernacular newspapers – in particular, Gujarat Samachar and Sandesh – ran false stories, fabricated sensational headlines with the intention to “provoke, communalize and terrorize people”, which incited and encouraged Hindus to kill Muslims. ""*

*""Instead, the then Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi openly praised Sandesh for its work. During the course of events leading up to the Gujarat carnage and in its aftermath, the circulation of Sandesh rose considerably due to its pro-Hindutva stand.""*

*""French historian Jean-Pierre Chrétien describes the behavior by journalists in inciting hatred and violence as ‘the democratic alibi’. A democratic alibi divorces the question of ethics from the political and employs the mechanisms of mass conditioning and mobilization required to create group hatred""*

https://thewire.in/media/punya-prasun-bajpai-abp-news-narendra-modi

&gt; The thousands of crore, the government spends on advertisement is the bribe these editors and journalists live on, like leeches. 

1. Not every govt is PR driven like the current one, so they don't usually spend a billion dollars in ads
2. Govt ads are only one of a news paper's revenue streams
3. In the days of online news, I don't think govt ads have any impact

&gt;The model creates opportunity for some sharper tools to shill for the party which isn't in power, but once was and will be in future, in centre or in some state.

You are saying businesses are choosing to forego imminent revenues for the possibility of revenues in some uncertain future date. Wah ribiy-ji wah! You should apply for the chief economic advisor's post that has just opened up, surely the govt needs more talent like you.

Acharya has specifically, in his post, pointed to instances wherein the editors previously asked that a generic BJP figure, not Modi, be featured in his cartoons. This is in keeping with a similar direction made to other media outlets, evidenced in the ABP resignations episode, which is why Acharya's claims have garnered attention. It points to a pattern of behaviour.

302,"True.

&gt; However, even for a print journalist it gets tiresome to dodge the truthful mentions again and again and as a reporter who has always been critical of the establishment, whether the Congress, the BJP or the Shiv Sena, the current atmosphere of fear does curtail one’s freedom somewhat.

&gt; To that extent, I must appreciate and place on record, the Shiv Sena’s indulgence of reporters even at a time they ran terror in Mumbai. The party did attack journalists who were critical of Bal Thackeray but **Thackeray himself could distinguish between those who were genuinely critical of his ideology and those who had a vested interest in showing him down**. He called them “supari journalists” - those who were paid by his rivals to run him down - and thought nothing of putting suparis out on them. Even so, no one got killed, only beaten up by his goons. **At the height of his powers, Mumbai was never a city where journalists had to look over their shoulders for taking him on.**

&gt; But that was also because those journalists taking him on had never taken any favours from him or the Shiv Sena. Those who had knew they had to maintain a discreet silence.

&gt; But, as is apparent from leading journalist Karan Thapar’s desperate struggle to get BJP spokespersons on his show, much of the journalism in the national capital is about one’s access to the ruling dispensation. That is why, in LK Advani’s infamous words, even during Emergency, when the journalists were asked to bend, they crawled.

&gt; **Now they are not even being asked to crawl but prefer to prostate before the authorities anyway because of all their irons are in the government fire and of course, Modi has mastered the art of squeezing all those who may need licences (as television does), something he had perfected in Gujarat vis-à-vis both media and industry.**

&gt; The crowd-funded digital space is today often the most courageous news space in India. You don’t need government largesse, you don’t have to bend over backwards. **Only technology, then, can rescue our democracy.**

366,"Atal Bihari Vajpayee ; 25 December 1924[1] – 16 August 2018) was an Indian politician who thrice served as the Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, for a period of eleven months from 1998 to 1999, and then for a full term from 1999 to 2004.

He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over four decades, being elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house, ten times, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament for Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh until 2009 when he retired from active politics due to health concerns. Vajpayee was among the founding members of the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh which he also headed from 1968 to 1972. He was the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji Desai.

When the Janata government collapsed, Vajpayee restructured the Jana Sangh into the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980. He was the first Indian prime minister who was not a member of the Indian National Congress party to have served a full five-year term in office.

He was conferred India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, by the President of India in 2015.The Modi government declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, would be marked as Good Governance Day. He died on 16 August 2018 due to age related illness.

Early life and education

Vajpayee was born to Krishna Devi and Krishna Bihari Vajpayee on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior. His grandfather, Pandit Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to Morena, Gwalior from his ancestral village of Bateshwar, Uttar Pradesh. His father, Krishna Bihari Vajpayee, was a school teacher in his hometown. Vajpayee did his schooling from the Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Gwalior. He subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College (now Laxmi Bai College) and graduated with distinction in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. He completed his post-graduation with an M.A. in Political Science from DAV College, Kanpur, and was awarded a first-class degree.

His activism started with Arya Kumar Sabha of Gwalior, the youth wing of the Arya Samaj, of which he became the general secretary in 1944. He also joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a swayamsevak in 1939. Influenced by Babasaheb Apte, he attended the Officers Training Camp of the RSS during 1940–44 and became a pracharak, RSS terminology for a a full-time worker, in 1947. He gave up studying law due to the partition riots. He was sent as a vistarak, a probationary pracharak, to Uttar Pradesh and quickly began working for the newspapers of Deendayal Upadhyaya, Rashtradharma (a Hindi monthly), Panchjanya (a Hindi weekly) and the dailies Swadesh and Veer Arjun.

Death

Vajpayee underwent knee replacement surgery at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai in 2001. He suffered a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech. His health had been a major source of concern and those in the know said he was often confined to a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. He also suffered from dementia and long-term diabetes. For many years, he was not known to have attended any public event and rarely ventured out of the house, except for checkups at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences.On 11 June 2018, Vajpayee was admitted to a hospital in critical condition.

He died at 5:05 pm IST on 16 August 2018 at AIIMS hospital due to age related illness.",2018-08-17 00:27:26

Two incidents when Atal-ji was still in his 30s illustrate this assessment.

&gt; Former Foreign Secretary M Rasgotra recounts in his autobiography, A Life in Diplomacy, how he received, when he was serving in the Indian Permanent Mission to the UN in 1958, a message from Prime Minister Nehru's office saying the PM was including a first-time MP, Vajpayee, in the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly and directing Rasgotra to take personal charge of him and introduce him to as many world leaders as possible because Pandit-ji saw great potential in the young man. 

&gt; The other incident relates to my rummaging through old newspapers in the dusty Mahadev Road archives of the Parliament House Library where I came across a small news-item on the back page of the Hindustan Times (October 1962), saying a four-member delegation of Jana Sangh MPs had called on PM Nehru to demand the immediate convening of parliament to discuss the on-going Chinese invasion. Nehru readily agreed and Vajpayee launched an all-out attack on Nehru that Nehru listened to politely and later replied to politely. That is how influential Vajpayee was even at the age of 36 with a Prime Minister from another party who, at the time, was exactly twice his age. (This is also a tribute to the democratic ethos that Nehru established and promoted).

&gt; Ullekh NP's riveting biography of Vajpayee tells the amusing story of the teenage Atal Bihari defying his father's concern as a government servant over his son's political inclinations by smuggling his khaki shorts into his sister's hands who threw them over the wall as soon as Atal Bihari escaped out of the house, so that he could slip them on before running off to the local RSS shakha. It is something of a mystery how despite this early ideological drilling, Vajpayee retained an open mind and an even more open heart. He could never be extreme. At the same time he could never defy the Sangh. 

&gt; ... And the most shameful U-turn he took was in March 2002 when, after roundly ticking off Modi for failing to observe the raj dharma, he did a chameleon trick and lavished praise on the very Chief Minister he had just a few days earlier strongly reprimanded. It took the sheen off Vajpayee.

&gt; ... He called an early election in 2004 and tolled his own bell. As I took my oath as a cabinet minister in the incoming government, I looked across the floor and saw a beaten man, sunk in a misery of despair and disappointment. I walked up to him and, to the severe disapproval of my leaders, bent to touch his feet to take his blessings as I ventured out fulfill my ambitions at the same time as his had come crashing down.

Our recent success in technical fields should not hide the fact that we are lagging behind in scientific research (and increasingly scientific temper).

383,"&gt; So congress changed the narrative and instead of blaming rss made it look like it was congress goons instead?

No, you misunderstood me. People today don't realise that there was an undertone of religious tension as the *khalistani* movement was a sikh religious fundamentalist movement. The Muslims in that area were scared due to the partition scars and the Hindus were angry at what they perceived as another attempt to divide India again by another minority. Many lived in fear and / or anger during this period and it was a tinder waiting to be ignited. 

The assassination of Indira Gandhi provided that. And the power vacuum and uncertainty that existed before Rajiv Gandhi took over was exploited by certain powerful individuals to ""teach the Sikhs a lesson"". The role of Congress politicians is well documented in this. Less is the RSS.

The point is, indian politics being what it was then, before the rise of the BJP, the Congress did have many religious fundamentalists. 

The Congress, in its political wisdom knew that it would strengthen the views of those who favoured a ""Hindu *Rashtra*"" if another minority (the Sikhs) in this country were also started to be viewed as the ""enemy"". Thus, they used their political influence to change the narrative of the *Khalistani* movement to a political separatist movement, rather than being a religious fundamentalist movement. Thus, after the riots, this has come to be identified more of a Congress vs *Khalistanis* issue (which, many like you, now also exaggerate as a Congress vs Sikh issue). 

There was also a certain amount of guilt in the Congress that religious fundamentalists within their organisation had been allowed to raise their heads, even if briefly, and it was felt this negative narrative against the congress would also act as a reminder to the Congress workers to fight religious fundamentalists within their organisation too, and not absolve them. 

&gt; Why didn't congress do the same regarding 2002 and modi?

Simple, the Congress is against **majoritarianism** (Majoritarianism is the political philosophy or agenda that asserts that a majority - sometimes categorized by religion, language, social class, or some other identifying factor - of the population is more superior and entitled to more primacy in society to make decisions disregarding the views of the minority). 

The Gujarat riots were organised by the ruling party that believes in majoritarianism (based on religion) against a minority community. 

This needed to be highlighted to show the country the dangers of majoritarianism in the guise of religion. 

(Another minor reason is that this was the booming period of the visual media (news TV channels) and they had already publicised the riots as Hindu - Muslim riots.)",2018-08-17 13:00:24

It is something of a mystery how despite this early ideological drilling, Vajpayee retained an open mind and an even more open heart. He could never be extreme. At the same time he could never defy the Sangh. 

&gt; ... And the most shameful U-turn he took was in March 2002 when, after roundly ticking off Modi for failing to observe the raj dharma, he did a chameleon trick and lavished praise on the very Chief Minister he had just a few days earlier strongly reprimanded. It took the sheen off Vajpayee.

&gt; ... He called an early election in 2004 and tolled his own bell. As I took my oath as a cabinet minister in the incoming government, I looked across the floor and saw a beaten man, sunk in a misery of despair and disappointment. I walked up to him and, to the severe disapproval of my leaders, bent to touch his feet to take his blessings as I ventured out fulfill my ambitions at the same time as his had come crashing down. I have no regrets that I did so. For all our differences, he was truly a great man.",2018-08-17 20:07:01

The crop proces boomed due to global commodity boom for next few years and therefore UPA victory in 2009. 

Rinse and repeat, poor crop prices on following years and UPA loses to NDA in 2014. 

2018 is turning out to be good for crop.proced so it's going to be Modi again in 2019, I believe. 

Of course there are were multiple other reasons in all the abovementioned elections like corruption, polarisation, over confidence, health of economy act but imo crop proces have been the most important and over riding theme. ",2018-08-19 00:58:03

467,"Why do people think BJP is the culprit of everything? Was India a great place to live in before 2014? People were in senses before 2014 but now BJP made them out of their senses? What kind of stupid logic is that? BJP is bad but was Congress much better than this that people think it's the worst thing that BJP has come into power and that we will soon be in a crisis or such.

Didn't murders or rapes happened earlier? If you think killing of journalists is new then you might know that this was common in Congress period too. What about all the scams? If Modi says regarding hinduvta then he is a troll but if he says regarding rape issue he is a troll too. People are now used to hearing so much bad news that all they do is hate BJP now. Most of the users here are around 25 and they know shit what happened in Congress period and everything bad that is happening today makes them feel like this is new and it didn't happen earlier.

469,"The only people I have seen spreading ""hate"" in the past few days are people trying to drum this up into an anti-government, anti-North India, anti-BJP, anti-Modi sentiment. They have gone all stops out, posting screenshots of obscure twitter accounts, retweeting them to give thtem higher visibility, spreading fake news about how only non-BJP states have sent aid to Kerala. Parties are complicit in this too, with the Left and Congress asking for floods in a state to be declared a national disaster, which it isn't. Hashtags like \#KeralaWontForget and \#KeralaRemembers are being spread non stop, despite the fact that central government agencies have been involved in search and rescue operations since the very beginning.

I understand that you are trying to highlight the suffering of travellers who face inordinate delays because of these circumstances. 


Rational changes, such as planning trips around low traffic times, co-location of governmental offices (green zones) and air ports, etc can be talked about, but to simply criticize our PM based on some other PM's security apparatus, in a completely different context, is not constructive.

Good thing under Modi is that there's a push on completion of targets. Officers are held responsible. Corruption is inherent in the system.

487,"It's a fallacy to compare current Modi govt. with Congress govt.s before 1990. It's not like economic liberalization happened only when BJP came into power. It's not even that opposition parties were demanding liberalization for those 40 years. Hence the fallacy imo. Comparing with the previous UPA govt. (2004-2014) would be more prudent.

 The Congress party itself brought about the change albeit only with the extraneous push. The old approach was based on misaligned economic policies (we as a country probably simply didn't know better). It reminds me of the posts I have seen online, where they think Newton was inept and naive as he was stuck with discoveries only in classical mechanics and Einstein is definitely the smartest of two.
That's again a fallacy in comparison imo.

While it is true that we are running behind economically, I think it gives our economic setup a more mixed flavor and would  MAYBE help become resillient in the long run. It's India in a microcosm I feel, so many diverse stuff put together in a single pot -- very bad for efficiency, but good for resillience.
