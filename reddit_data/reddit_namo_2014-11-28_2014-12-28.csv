3,"My other post was downvoted by NAMO army, but here is what Modi said back in 2012 :

&gt;Today, Astrology is known to be a well known profession and is being associated with money. People from the so called elite class are today seen standing in queues and paying through the nose for consulting an Astrologer. These people on one hand call themselves staunch atheists and defame Indiaâ€™s culture and on the other hand visit a fortune-teller. Why? It is because in this, lie their vested interests. If this aspect of our culture finds its relevance today, then I think there might be other aspects of our culture that might also find relevance today.

&gt;NASA might be doing a lot in the field of astronomy, but our ancestors also contributed in the same field. I am of the opinion that if India takes a step in the direction of combining our ancestorsâ€™ knowledge and Science, then I am sure we can give something new and valuable to the world. ** Today, whatever we learn in Science and whatever new discoveries are being made related to planetary orbits, activity of the Earth and the Sun, distance between two planetsâ€”all this has already been carried out by our ancestors long time back in the past. **

&gt;If you talk about Vedic Mathematics in India today, people will think you are some weird person and that from where you got the idea of learning Vedic Mathematics. People will say you are a conservative and that you want to take the country back to 18th century. It is the scientific era and how can you even talk about introducing Vedic Mathematics.

7,"Let the NaMo army here answer that

Perhaps they have already build up a rationale of why this is good and is the correct way of doing things

No, wait, they will say let Congress answer first then, we will think about it",2014-12-05 13:34:20
8,What did you get. NaMo asked his MP's to do some clean up and all they could come up with was photo-ops. Jharoo Marne ko bola to PR karne lag padey. Modi sara desh micro-manage kareyga kya.,2014-12-05 16:27:16

13,today NAMO Army is on roll. deal with it.,2014-12-09 15:02:19
14,"Obviously, I disagree. But there is no point having a civil discourse on r/India, since the NaMo army is here to 'defend' their great leader. See /u/IndianBureaucrat's perfectly reasonable comment in another comment thread here which is currently at around -20. No point in arguing with the kind of retards who do this kind of brigading.",2014-12-13 14:44:42

17,Did they have any popular short names? Like Mahatma or NaMo?,2014-12-15 16:20:27
18,"If government is being forced to use a circular of Rajeev Gandhi's government (there have been 8 PMs after that excluding Namo) to defend a stupidity then they should go back to the drawing board. 

This is not why we elected you. ",2014-12-19 00:12:00
19,"The circle-jerk is strong on this thread. Guy says he won't give undue favours to Reliance, and the right-wingers go into a frenzy, 'AAP is rekt', 'AAPians are stupid', etc. etc. What the hell else did you expect the fellow to say? That he WILL give undue favours to Reliance? The level of stupidity witnessed on this sub is sometimes amazing.

Also, to find any reasonable comments in this circle-jerk of a thread, you have to scroll to the bottom, where the NaMo army has done its brigading and downvoted anything that goes against the circle jerk.",2014-12-19 09:20:22
20,"Well said.

But unfortunately this being the NaMo army circle jerk thread of the day your comment will be downvoted into oblivion. ",2014-12-19 09:30:29

24,"Thanks to the fucking NaMo army.

@mods: why the hell is this perfectly valid comment being vote brigaded into oblivion? I would say you guys are not doing your job properly. In the last few days alts and bots of the NaMo army have been having a free reign on this sub.",2014-12-20 20:20:15
25,"yes dude, the majority of this country is a vote brigading namo army. that's how he's winning all these elections. wtf! just read nishant's comment. it has got nothing to do with what bhagwat said here. he's talking something completely different from what the other idiot said about wiping christians and muslims from india.",2014-12-20 23:06:48

28,"Party will need to have sound volunteer base if it has to convert crowds to vote.
The party's symbol does not have same recall in TN as in north.
Peepals may like NaMo and may like to vote for him,but may end up voting on 'two leaves' as they simply do not know Modi's party's symbol is 'Lotus'",2014-12-21 15:48:59

30,"How about rape, acid attacks, victim blaming and the lot? NaMo pls. ",2014-12-25 19:30:04
31,"Hindu electorate has always responded favorably to aggressive Hindutva, and has been swayed by violent actions done in its name. In each of the elections after the illegal destruction of Babri Masjid, Bombay riots, Godhra riots, Hindu Parties reaped rich electoral rewards. That's why a ""secularized"" L. K Advani lost, and NaMo won. There is nothing AAP and Cong can do about that. 

BJP knows that perfectly, hence its 5 year term will involve massaging ego of the majority community, invoking the Hindu vicitim-hood card, and making Indian identity synonymous to Hindu identity.
