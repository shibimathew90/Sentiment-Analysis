**Modicare is a ‘hoax’! After Amartya Sen, this economist slams Modi government** 

 ______ 
Noted development economist Jean Dreze said that Modicare is a ‘hoax’

After presenting the Budget 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave a name to
government’s ambitious healthcare scheme Ayushmann Bharat: Modicare. He said
that nobody knew whether Obamacare was successful but Modicare will become
successful in every possible way. Dubbed as “world’s largest government-funded
health care programme” aims to provide health insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh
per family per annum to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families.

While the programme is yet to be launched, noted development economist Jean
Dreze said that it is a ‘hoax’, not as big as it is being claimed to be. “The
budget (for the scheme) for this year is 2,000 crore. Even if it is spent,
it’s less than 20 rupees per person,” he said at the launch of his book, co-
authored with Amartya Sen, ‘Bharat Aur Uske Virodhabhas’, the Hindi edition of
his book ‘An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradiction’.

It is projected as health insurance for 50 crore people, but it is virtually
nothing, Jean Dreze said. The Belgian-born Indian economist helped the UPA
government in the first draft of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act (MNREGA). Jean Dreze became an Indian citizen in 2002 and is an
honorary Professor at the Delhi School of Economics.

The government is hoping to have the final blueprint of the plan by August 15,
which will mark India’s 72nd Independence Day anniversary. Although
beneficiaries have been identified and the IT infrastructure has been put in
place, the involvement of hospitals — public and private — and insurance
companies was still to be finalised, Bloomberg reported quoting Indu Bhushan,
chief executive officer of the project.

Meanwhile, BJP-ruled states Rajasthan and Maharashtra are showing reluctance
in opting for the health care plan as they are not sure about how to implement
it and they already have state healthcare plans. The announcement of the
Modicare plan was welcomed but with a grain of salt.

“The experience with previous insurance schemes tells us that most such
measures tend to end as damp squibs in the absence of effective implementation
and monitoring,” Sunita Narain, CSE DG had said in February. The concept of
universal healthcare coverage is not too ambitious. A World Bank report said
that many countries including Nepal, Afghanistan and Thailand are on the right
track to achieve it.

However, for a scheme like Modicare to succeed, it is important that the
“basic health care infrastructure for delivery of primary health services is
strong”, a healthcare study said.

Although India’s health budget has not changed much since 2009 and remained
merely between 0.98% and 1.18% of the GDP, one of the lowest in the world, its
ranking on Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) index has improved. India moved
up from 153 in 1990 to 145 in 2016 in raking on the HAQ index. “India’s
improvements on the HAQ Index hastened from 2000 to 2016,” a study published
by medical journal The Lancet said, adding that sub-national inequalities are
still a concern.

**Former BJP MLA and now AAP leader, Kanubhai Kalsaria likely to join Congress** 

 ______ 
Written by

Syed Khalique Ahmed

| Ahmedabad |

Published: July 10, 2018 1:02:37 am

Speaking to The Indian Express, 63-year-old Kalsaria, a surgeon by profession,
said he was having discussions with state Congress leaders, including party
president Amit Chavda.

AAP leader and former BJP MLA Dr Kanubhai Kalsaria is set to join the Congress
after a meeting with party president Rahul Gandhi. Rahul is likely to visit
the state on July 16-17 to meet farmers in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts of
Saurashtra region.

Speaking to The Indian Express, 63-year-old Kalsaria, a surgeon by profession,
said he was having discussions with state Congress leaders, including party
president Amit Chavda. “I will meet Rahul Gandhi during his tour of Saurashtra
and hold talks on joining the party,” he said. “I will certainly join the
Congress if everything works out well. It is my final decision.”

Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi, when contacted, said, “Talks are on with
Kalsaria and he may be taken in the party during Rahul Gandhi’s visit or after
it.”

Kalsaria, who won Mahuva seat as a BJP candidate in 1998, 2002 and 2007, went
against the decision of the BJP and the then chief minister Narendra Modi to
allow Nirma’s proposed cement plant near Mahuva in 2008-09. He strongly
supported farmers of the area, who opposed the proposed plant as it was being
built on water bodies. Kalsaria had contended that it would destroy the local
environment and contaminate the groundwater due to mining of lime from nearby
coastal areas (lime being one of the main ingredients of cement). The matter
ultimately reached the Gujarat High Court and the Nirma plant was shelved. But
it also resulted in Kalsaria’s quitting the BJP.

Subsequently, he formed Sabhavna Manch after he could not manage to enter the
Congress. In 2012 Assembly elections, he fielded four Sadbhavna Manch
candidates in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts, and himself entered the fray
from Gariyadhar seat. However, all his candidates lost. He also lost
Gariyadhar, coming third after the Congress, with the BJP candidate emerging
victorious.

Later, he joined AAP and became its state convener. He contested Lok Sabha
elections from Bhavnagar seat in 2014 on an AAP ticket but lost again.
Kalsaria then tried to join the Congress, but was not successful. In 2017
Assembly elections, while he was still in AAP, he contested as an independent
from Mahuva seat, in the hope that the Congress would extend support to him.
He also met Rahul in this connection, but the party did not agree. The
Congress, sources said, wanted Kalsaria to quit AAP and contest as an
independent or a Congress candidate.

The Congress was then fighting a bitter battle with AAP in Delhi. Both
Congress and Kalsaria lost Mahuva, and the BJP won. With no third viable
political option in the state, sources said, Kalsaria has now decided to join
the Congress. Congress sources said the party too wanted to induct Kalsaria to
offset the loss of Congress MLA Kunwarji Bavaliya crossing over to the BJP.
Congress leaders reportedly feel that the entry of Kalsaria, hailing from the
OBC Ahir community, will bring OBC, particularly Ahir, votes to the party in
the Bhavnagar-Amreli belt as well as Kutch region.

**Fear of losing company making firms pay up, says chairman of new bankruptcy board** 

 ______ 
India’s new bankruptcy law has instilled fear among delinquent borrowers and
prompted several reluctant founders to repay outstanding debt due to the risk
of losing their company, according to its insolvency regulator.

“There is a perceptible difference in the behaviour of borrowers and lenders,”
MS Sahoo, chairman of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, said,
referring to the period since the introduction of Insolvency and Bankruptcy
Code (IBC) in 2016. “The stakeholders know that the firm goes into liquidation
if they fail to arrive at a resolution plan within the specified time.”

Companies facing bankruptcy petitions have reportedly cleared dues of as much
as Rs 830 billion ($12 billion) with creditors, Sahoo said in an interview at
his New Delhi office last week. This will support growth by improving capacity
utilization and rescuing failed businesses, he said.

The insolvency code replaced a web of archaic laws, some dating back a 100
years, and helped India jump 30 points to make it to the top 100 countries in
World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings. The new law is key for Prime
Minister Narendra Modi to wipe out bad loans and boost growth in Asia’s third-
largest economy.

The law empowers lenders to drag companies that have defaulted for 90 days on
debt exceeding Rs100,000 to the bankruptcy court which then places it under an
administrator to examine a revival or an outright sale. If a plan is not
worked out within three quarters, then the company’s assets get liquidated.
The objective was to bring debt-laden companies back on their feet and help
banks free up $210 billion of stressed assets for lending.

A report by the Reserve Bank of India estimates that gross bad-loan ratio may
increase to 12.2% by March 2019 from 11.6% in the previous year, limiting
bank’s ability to lend to businesses.

**Next phase**

The government is also working to put in place, as early as next month, new
rules to hold accountable individuals, who stood guarantee for loans to a
company, in case of a default. The scope of the regulation would later be
expanded to include individual businessmen and eventually every private
citizen.

India is also planning regulations on cross-border insolvency to pursue
foreign assets of a defaulting company. It is working on the model cross-
border insolvency law adopted by the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law to harmonize cooperation between countries.

Work on that front has already begun, Sahoo said, adding the government would
need to amend the law to incorporate the proposed changes.

Even as the government tries to widen the scope of bankruptcy law, bitter
court battles have bogged down efforts to clean up bad loans through the new
code and companies are missing the 270-day deadline for resolution. The
government is running against time to fix the legal and operational issues
that keep cropping up and has tweaked the norms several times.

“If you are flying an aircraft at 30,000 feet and it has developed a snag, you
don’t have the luxury to come down to the ground and repair it.” Sahoo said.
“Laws need to be made as and when the market needs it. If you do not respond
promptly the loss is much more.”

**Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lay foundation stone for Purvanchal Expressway on July 14**

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of ambitious
354-km. (Representational image)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of ambitious
354-km, 8-lane Purvanchal Expressway, linking Lucknow to Ghazipur, on July 14
in Azamgarh.

This was revealed by UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey today in a statement,
spelling out the itinerary of the Prime Minister’s upcoming programmes in the
state.

“On July 14, Prime Minister Modi will be in Azamgarh to lay the foundation
stone of the Purvanchal Expressway and address a public meeting.

“On July 15, he will be in Mirzapur, while on July 21  
he will be addressing a kisan kalyan rally in Shahjahanpur,” said Pandey.

“The Prime Minister is coming to UP with the message of development and
farmers’ welfare in the next few days. This is indeed a moment of happiness
for us. In-charges for various programmes have been made and responsibilities
given to them,” he added

Originally a six-lane expressway, but expandable to 8-lane later, the
Purvanchal Expressway is to link Lucknow with Ghazipur and scheduled to be
completed within 36 months, though the state government is keen to have it
completed within 24 to 26 months.

The 354 km- expressway is set to reduce the travel time between Lucknow to
Ghazipur to 4.30 to 5 hours.

The total access controlled expressway with provisions of service roads and
underpasses for vehicles, pedestrians and animals would be passing through
eight districts of the state and would be linked to Varanasi through a
separate link road.

**This is why hundreds of South Koreans visit Ayodhya every year** 

 ______ 
By:

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Updated: July 10, 2018 8:37:21 pm

Heo was first mentioned in a thirteenth-century Korean text known as Samguk
Yusa as the wife of King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya, which was a ruling city-state
in Korea during the period of the Three Kingdoms. (Wkimedia Commons)

India and South Korea on Tuesday signed at least 11 agreements to further
enhance business ties and more than double mutual trade to $50 billion by
2030, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi underlined India’s commitment to
deepening strategic cooperation between the two countries.

Visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in and PM Modi also asked their
respective business communities to expand investment and promote joint
ventures. The two sides discussed various issues in the realm of defence and
security, artificial intelligence, trade besides resolving to work together
for regional peace and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction (WMD).

Besides bilateral talks, the leaders are also likely to discuss the building
of a memorial park in Ayodhya that pays tribute to a 2,000-year-old story of
the deep-rooted relationship between the two countries.

As per reports, every year, hundreds of South Koreans visit the birthplace of
the Hindu God Ram for the sake of paying homage to their legendary queen Heo
Hwang-ok, also known as Princess Suriratna. Heo was first mentioned in a
thirteenth-century Korean text known as Samguk Yusa as the wife of King Suro
of Geumgwan Gaya, which was a ruling city-state in Korea during the period of
the Three Kingdoms.

The Samguk Yusa was compiled by a group of Buddhist monks as a collection of
fables and historical accounts connected to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which
included Baejke, Silla, and Gogureyo. Modern Korea derived its name from
Gogureyo. The text mentions that Heo was the princess of Ayuta kingdom and
that she arrived in Korea as a 16-year-old in 48 CE. She then married King
Suro and is regarded as the first Queen of Geumgwan Gaya.

Though the Samguk Yusa is the only text that mentions Heo’s connection with
Ayuta kingdom, there is no mention of where Ayuta was precisely located. All
it suggests is that she came from an ancient land. Later, however,
anthropologist Kim Byung-mo is believed to have suggested Ayuta to mean
Ayodhya, based on phonetic similarities. However, this association is unclear
because, during the ancient period, Ayodhya was named as Saketa.

The tomb of Heo is located in Gimhae and a stone pagoda in front of it
mentions that it is made of stones brought by her from Ayodhya. (Wikimedia
Commons)

Nevertheless, people of South Korea have continued to revere Heo and the Karak
clan society in Gimhae is believed to be the descendants of her and King Suro.
The tomb of Heo is located in Gimhae and a stone pagoda in front of it
mentions that it is made of stones brought by her from Ayodhya. “The Gimhae
Kims believe that they are the descendants of Queen Heo and have an ancient
genealogical link with India. The Gimhae Kims are proud of this lineage and
mention this fact whenever they meet Indian visitors,” writes former
ambassador of India to South Korea, Skand R. Tayal in his book ‘ India and
Republic of Korea: Engaged Democracies.’

He goes on to note that historians, however, believe the princess of Ayodhya
to be a myth.

**PM Modi Opens World's Largest Cellphone Factory Near Delhi** 

 ______ 
Narendra Modi travelled with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Noida in
Metro

**NOIDA: **

The world's biggest mobile factory was launched in Noida near Delhi on Monday
by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The
unit will have a capacity of fabricating 120 million phones a year \-- ranging
from low-end smartphones that cost under $100 to the company's flagship S9
model. It will build 10 million phones a month, 70 per cent of which will be
earmarked for domestic usage.

Already 40 crore Indians own smartphones, 32 crore people use broadband, the
Prime Minister said in his address at the event. The 30 per cent phones for
export will help place the country in the Global market, he added.

""This step today would lend pace to Make in India, apart from empowering
citizens... This is matter of pride for Uttar Pradesh and India,"" said PM
Modi, who has been pushing foreign firms to set up plants in the country.

Last year, the government imposed taxes on import of key smartphone components
as part of a plan to make India a electronics-manufacturing hub to boost
growth and create tens of millions of new jobs.

""Samsung has provided employment to approximately 70,000 people, the new plant
will provide employment to 1000 more,"" the Prime Minister pointed out.

PM Modi and the South Korean president travelled to Noida for the Samsung
factory launch on the Delhi Metro. In photos tweeted by PM Modi, the two
leaders were seen chatting on the metro, the Akshardham temple visible in the
window behind them.

__

Last year, India overtook the US to become the world's second-largest
smartphone market after China. There will be 780 million connected smartphones
in 2021, compared with 359 million in 2016, according to a study by Cisco
Systems.

**Godrej Group Moves Court Against Land Acquisition For Bullet Train Project** 

 ______ 
The bullet train between Mumbai and Ahemdabad will run a total of 508.17km
(Representational)

**Mumbai: **

The Godrej Group has moved the Bombay High Court challenging the proposed
acquisition of its prime property in suburban Vikhroli to pave way for the
government's ambitious bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.

The company has sought a direction to authorities concerned to change the
project's alignment, so that it can get nearly 8.6 acres of land belonging to
its infrastructure arm Godrej Construction out of the project's map.

As per the current alignment of the bullet train project, of the total 508.17
km of rail track between Mumbai and Ahemdabad, about 21 km is planned to be
underground. One of the entry points to the underground tunnel falls on the
land in Vikhroli. The petition, filed last month, is expected to be heard by a
single judge bench of the high court on July 31.

The bullet train project is also facing opposition from farmers in Gujarat and
Maharashtra. Four farmers from Gujarat have petitioned the high court in their
state challenging land acquisition.

The foundation stone for the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in September last year in Ahmedabad.

__

The country's first bullet train will run at a maximum speed of 350 km per
hour, covering the stretch in under three hours from the usual seven. The
train will halt at 12 stations, out of which four will be in Maharashtra.

**India replaces France as world’s 6th biggest economy**

India, with around 1.34 billion inhabitants, is poised to become the world’s
most populous nation. Photo: Mint

**Paris:** India has become the world’s sixth-biggest economy, pushing France into seventh place, according to updated World Bank figures for 2017. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to $2.597 trillion at the end of last year, against $2.582 trillion for France. India’s economy rebounded strongly from July 2017, after several quarters of slowdown blamed on economic policies pursued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.

India, with around 1.34 billion inhabitants, is poised to become the world’s
most populous nation, whereas the French population stands at 67 million. This
means that India’s per capita GDP continues to amount to just a fraction of
that of France which is still roughly 20 times higher, according to World Bank
figures.

Manufacturing and consumer spending were the main drivers of the Indian
economy last year, after a slowdown blamed on the demonetisation of large
banknotes that Modi imposed at the end of 2016, as well as a chaotic
implementation of a new harmonised goods and service tax regime.

India has doubled its GDP within a decade and is expected to power ahead as a
key economic engine in Asia, even as China slows down.

According to the International Monetary Fund, India is projected to generate
growth of 7.4% this year and 7.8% in 2019, boosted by household spending and a
tax reform. This compares to the world’s expected average growth of 3.9%.

The London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy,
said at the end of last year that India would overtake both Britain and France
this year in terms of GDP, and had a good chance to become the world’s third-
biggest economy by 2032.

At the end of 2017, Britain was still the world’s fifth-biggest economy with a
GDP of $2.622 trillion. The US is the world’s top economy, followed by China,
Japan and Germany.

Personally, I really have nothing to say about him because I am of his era, and knew how our generation accepted his apologies hence he was still able to remain popular and people loved his movies. It was us citizens way to forgive and forget unless he was still involved in Terrorism which he was definitely for 2 decades. We really need to learn basic concepts and definitions so we can make difference between Hafeez Saeed and Sanjay Dutt? Do current young generation wants to see Sanjay Dutt as same as hate spewing Saeed or as a guy who for reformed much much earlier than his remaining sentences, which he completed without any hassles. The Indian Law forgave him, the young generation should understand that basic level first. How Law works, What's the meaning of paid the dues to the society, Reformation. Only then one must judge a person. In 20 years, did we see him posing with more rifles? 20 years is a big thing , I know that cuz now I am 42 and can tell you for real how time flies.

He was an asshole, but the point I would look at is 'he was'. Drugs and Arrogance ruined his life and taught him good. Then we have a PM who after commiting terrorism and rioting, he gave a puppy analogy and got more popular. Without going to jail and accepting his mistakes. Even Vajpayee was angry that Modi didn't accept his mistakes, let alone, conviction. 

Sanjay Dutt suffered enough and is still suffering with countless of loss that he has seen. I think he is a moral lesson for the new generation to not mess up like he did and follow the law and don't be reckless. To me that's Reformation.

Kumar Jha said that the information sought was by third party and has not
provided any stake in the property, hence it cannot be provided.

The activist, in a statement to the media, however claims that allotment of
government land was not third party information and should have been provided.

84,"I look at social media this way. 

Great place for all kinds of information. At the end of the day, being an information-democracy means the world is at your finger tips. But information merely is not enough. 

It's about how you personally process it, filter it, judge, debate, argue, rationalise it, research on it, judge it, investigate it, so on and so forth. This requires the use of the intellect. And when you look at the levels of intellect of majority of Indians with information and smart phones and internet at their fingertips, there is large discrepencies between different groups, classes, stratas or however you'd want to group them to understand these discrepancies. 

At the end of the day, how you filter noise from all the info available depends on real-life parameters. Like your educational standars (which is bad anyway in this country thanks to rote-leararnjng), surroundings - where you grew up, the kinds of people you've met (social identities) and ways of treating them that you've learned and the likes, your socio- economic and socio cultural status, personal biases, societal biases, etc. 

Now, you may overcome things such as biases as a result of fav conditions. You will have your ideals constantly tested and evolving, as well as your political, social, moral, ethical, philosophical, economical beliefs and so on and so forth. However primary school dropout can maybe not. And not as much. Hence, it's easier to play with the fools, and ignorant cause they will swing wherever emotional bs is stirred. Bad politicians win that way, or good ones start resorting to bad means.

As far as I'm concerned, anything that looks grey to me, which is a lot of things, I try to find a more balanced view, tally with my ideals, some set in stone like secularism and liberalism because co-existence, while others depend on that particular matter such as ""how do I convince a bigot to give up on hate"" where I swing between absolute disgust and rejection to maybe, sometimes, conversing in order to try and win the mind of that ignorant douchebag.  

Even at times of radio and newspapers, even after reading everything, one needed to read between the lines for a lot of matters to come to the truth which wouldn't sometimes be explicitly written for many different reasons. The world is not much different now. 

Coming to your question, you're referring to personal experiences. Us, in randia, will have a different set of answers. Compare that to a sampling mix that represents most Indians from diff parts and diff places and diff cateogories, it'll be different, even if downright k human and wrong. 

So, if pro-modi posts rise, then the counter will have to be equally dumb but attractive for a lot of groups. Unfortunately, that means the public discourse will lower even more and political discussions will continue to be on unimportant issues and tensions, drummed up while at it. You cannot expect all the things that allow bs WhatsApp forwards to exist in the first place, to be simmer and evaporate with one counter post. That's politics. 

What is needed is knowledge, and that's lacking.

While the book looks back at the movement led by Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan that led to the passing of the RTI Act in 2005, **uppermost on the minds of many RTI users in attendance were recent attempts to malign those who file applications**. Once the floor was thrown open for questions, a member of the audience stood up and asked Roy what RTI users could do about recent assertions that most of them are blackmailers...

&gt; ... Roy’s answer was simple: **“Ask them for the data. Ask them for a list of names and FIRs. They won’t be able to give it because it is not true.”**

&gt; **What the blackmail claims are actually about, say RTI users and civil activists, is discrediting those who use RTI, which in turn is part of a larger campaign to undermine the act**. “It is a formula to call RTI users blackmailers,” says Krishna Gupta, who, at 20, is one of the country’s youngest RTI activists. **“This is a tactic to scare people.”**

&gt; **Thirteen years after the landmark RTI Act was passed — an Act that is hailed as one of the best laws anywhere in the world — it has proved to be extraordinarily impactful**. Just this week, news broke that **Rs 745.59 crore worth of banned notes were deposited with the Ahmedabad District Co-operative Bank** in the first five days after Prime Minister **Narendra Modi announced demonetisation on November 8, 2016**. This was the largest amount collected by any district co-operative bank, but what made the news particularly noteworthy was that **BJP president Amit Shah is one of the bank’s directors**. The source of information was an RTI application filed by Manoranjan Roy, a Mumbai RTI activist.

&gt; ... **According to Gandhi, the Act is being besieged on three sides. The first is that Public Information Officers (PIOs) have devised strategies of how not to give information, the second is the classification of RTI users as blackmailers and extortionists, and the third is recent rulings passed by the courts.** “A lot of their interpretations are slowly strangling the law,” Gandhi told Mumbai Mirror in an interview. One such judgment Gandhi refers to is in the Girish Ramachandra Deshpande case, in which the Supreme Court denied the release of information relating to the salary of a government official, memos relating to his censure, details of gifts received and asset and investment information, on the grounds that it was personal information and, therefore, would amount to invasion of privacy. According to Professor Sridhar Acharyulu, a sitting central information commissioner, about 60 per cent of RTI applications are being rejected citing this order as precedent.

&gt; ... **No matter the party or parties in power, governments have tried to dilute the RTI act ever since it was passed**. The first attempt at amending the Act was made about eight months after it came into law by the same government that passed it. That attempt was defeated by public protest and Roy believes the same approach will be required to stop the current government from amending the act too. **“We will have to go to the streets. It is a war of attrition. We can’t give up.”**",2018-07-12 12:41:49

Zafar Sareshwala, an old friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was taken aback when last month Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani did not show up for his popular ‘Taleem ki Taqat’ function in Ahmedabad after earlier giving a suitable date. Sareshwala, who has organised numerous such programmes for empowering Muslim youth, was taken aback by Rupani’s ‘ill manners’. Most Central ministers and chief ministers, as well as leading bankers, are keen to attend his programmes and workshops. Some suspect that Rupani’s absenteeism is because of a minority bias. In fact, many others have similar complaints. **Rupani is reportedly lying low because of instructions from New Delhi. The BJP central leadership is apprehensive of deputy chief minister, Nitin Patel, who, as finance minister, is sitting over numerous files and not clearing projects.

Financially empowered women

are a ""bulwark against

"", Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

today said while interacting with more than one crore women associated with
various self-help groups across the country.

""For

women empowerment

financial independence is necessary. Women are enterprising, they don't need

development of rural areas.

Since 2014 the government has created 20 lakh self-help groups on priority,
and over 2.25 crore families have been brought into their fold, he said.

""So far 45 lakh women self help groups have been created with 5 crore active
women participants... in fact these groups have added one more earning member
in these five crore families in rural areas,"" he said.

for rural economy cannot run without the participation of women.

During the interaction, women also shared their inspiring and touching stories

**India mulls bringing jet fuel, natural gas under GST** 

 ______ 
**by Shruti Srivastava  
**

India is proposing to bring

jet fuel

and natural

gas

under the national goods and services tax as early as next week and replace a
slew of existing duties and provincial levies, people familiar with the matter
said.

A tax panel will decide July 21 whether to approve the proposal to levy a 28
percent tax on aviation fuel, the people said, asking not to be identified as
deliberations are confidential. This will be the first step towards charging
GST on petroleum products under the new tax system, one of the biggest reforms
for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Indian states charge as much as 30 percent in sales tax on aviation turbine
fuel, on top of a 14 percent excise duty, making it the costliest in Asia. The
levies hurt profitability of airlines, which say that fuel accounts for 40
percent of their costs. Combined taxes in New Delhi, India’s busiest airport,
are 39 percent, while Singapore charges just 7 percent value-added tax.

Bringing the fuel under the national tax regime will make it easier for
airlines to make payments as the rate will be uniform across the country
unlike now when it varies from state to state. D.S. Malik, a spokesman for
India’s finance ministry declined to comment.

Ministers from Central and state governments will also discuss introducing an
additional tariff to bridge any shortfall in government revenues due to the
new structure, the people said, a move that could nullify any monetary gains
for airlines. The government is yet to propose a final tax rate on natural
gas, they said.

**How long will India have to wait for the bullet train? A status check** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

's ambitious Japan-backed

Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train

project costing $17 billion must speed up to to meet the August 2022 deadline.
The biggest challenge for the project is

land acquisition

. The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is acquiring
around 1,400 hectares of linear land at a cost of Rs 10,000 crore in 195
villages in Gujarat and in 104 in Maharashtra and a small area in Dadra &amp;amp;
Nagar Haveli.

It has faced stiff resistance from farmers and tribals, especially in the
Palghar district of Maharashtra.

**How much land has been acquired so far?**

NHSRCL has to complete land acquisition by December 2018. So far only 0.9
hectares in Bandra-Kurla Complex has been physically handed over, according to
a report in The Indian Express. Before the acquisition process, an aerial
survey is conducted to identify the land. The results of the aerial survey are
verified with a physical survey. After that a joint measurement survey is done
by by a team of all stakeholders. The compensation process begins on the basis
of this survey. While the aerial survey was completed early last year, the
physical survey, started in December, has covered 184 villages in Gujarat and
50 in Maharashtra, according to the report.

**Legal challenges **

According to the report, five petitions have been filed in the Gujarat High
Court — either challenging a 2013 Gujarat amendment to the Land Acquisition
Act, demanding the preliminary notification be quashed, or refusing to part
with fertile land. The Godrej group has filed a petition In Bombay High Court
challenging acquisition of its 3.5 hectares in Vikhroli. It has offered
another piece of land close by.

**The compensation **

NHSRCL has adopted different compensation mechanisms in the two states due to
different laws. In Maharashtra, the company is paying four times the circle
rate of the land, plus a 25% bonus, as well as a one-time payment of Rs 5
lakh, according to the report. If one loses a house, he or she can choose
either a new one built nearby (500 sq feet) or money to buy a new house
elsewhere at twice the construction cost. For livelihood loss, the offer is Rs
3,600 per month for one year. There is a provision for a one-time, Rs 5 lakh
rehabilitation payment to landless agriculture workers, and a one-time. Rs
25,000 to employees of shops on land to be acquired. Even for forest land, the
project is paying 50% of land cost to the displaced and the remaining 50% to
the state government. For fruit-bearing trees axed, farmers are being offered
the amount expected to be earned for the remainder of the tree’s lifetime.
Besides, the company pays a 12% interest on the compensation amount to be
calculated from the date of notice

In Gujarat, the report says, the compensation is more than four times the
prevailing price. The Gujarat government plans to offer either 4.75 times the
existing jantri prices (the state yardstick) or the average rate within a
1.5-km radius, whichever is higher. The company is offering a 25% bonus, and
the same livelihood-loss-related sops as offered in Maharashtra.

**Why are people protesting?**

Apart from compensation, there are several other issues such as the impact of
the project on resources, restrictions on activities and vibrations from the
train, says the report. Since

bullet train

is a high-speed train, its track has to avoid curves and be as straight as
possible. That requires splitting of farm land at several places which can
disrupt farm operations. The report says farmers have not been given clear
information on issues such as permission of movement across the tracks.

According to the report, for land being split, the company is paying a special
compensation based on the extent — a 50-50 split has a different compensation
from, say, 75-25. The land that remains on either side continues to belong to
the owner, who can use it as he or she wishes. Only for digging and building a
highrise will he need to inform the NHSRCL. The company has responded to the
villagers' demands of proving amenities such as healthcare, education,
drinking water and sanitation.

**Congress Cautions Shashi Tharoor Amid Row Over ""Hindu Pakistan"" Comment** 

 ______ 
Shashi Tharoor said the BJP wanted to change the constitution as well. (File
picture)

**New Delhi: **

Shashi Tharoor was cautioned today by his party, the Congress, and urged to
keep ""restraint and caution"" following a political row over his comment that
the BJP would make India a ""Hindu Pakistan"" if it came to power in 2019.
Speaking to NDTV, Mr Tharoor firmly defended his statement, saying: ""Why
should I apologise when they enshrine the ideals of a Hindu Rashtra?""  
  
The ruling BJP has reacted with outrage and demanded Mr Tharoor's apology.  
  
In his lecture on the ""Threats faced by Indian Democracy and Secularism"" on
Wednesday, he had said that there was a ""...great danger... that if they (BJP)
are able to win a repeat of their current strength in the Lok Sabha, then
frankly our democratic constitution as we understand will not survive because
they will have all the three elements they need to tear up the Constitution of
India and write a new one. That will be a new one which will enshrine the
principle of Hindu Rashtra, will remove equality for minorities, that will
create a Hindu Pakistan and that isn't what Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar
Patel, Maulana Azad and great heroes of freedom struggle fought for.""

This morning, he put out a Facebook post saying his statement had been
""bizarrely misconstrued"" and explained: ""The BJP/RSS idea of a Hindu Rashtra
is the mirror image of Pakistan -- a state with a dominant majority religion
that seeks to put its minorities in a subordinate place. That would be a Hindu
Pakistan.""  
  
The former union minister told NDTV that neither the BJP nor Prime Minister
Narendra Modi had done nothing to change that view: ""It is clear that the BJP
has stood for a Hindu Rashtra, it is a part of the official ideology of the
party. The PM has asked the party to read about the thoughts and ideas of Deen
Dayal Upadhyay, who did not believe in the constitution. These leaders believe
the constitution and nation should be built for Hindu people. The PM has never
said he disagrees with this.""  
  

On the BJP's demand for Congress president Rahul Gandhi's apology, the former
union minister said this had always been his stand and he had expressed the
same view in 2013.

__

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra had said, ""Congress was responsible for creation
of Pakistan because of its ambitions. Yet again it has gone ahead to demean
India and defame Hindus of India.""

**Ageing population may hurt BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha elections** 

 ______ 
Photo: Mint

One of the factors ascribed to the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
under Narendra Modi ahead of the 2014 general elections was the party’s appeal
to youth. With about 40% of registered voters in the 2014 elections being
under the age of 35, and the BJP relying heavily on data and social media
messaging, analysts concluded that the party’s popularity among younger voters
was crucial in its victory in those elections.

And there is data to support this hypothesis.

One of the benefits of opinion and exit polls is that they make it possible to
analyse voting patterns using data that is not available in official
elections. Most opinion and exit polls collect demographic data on the
respondent, such as age, religion, caste, income, household size, etc., and
this is an invaluable resource for political parties, analysts and anyone else
whose livelihood might depend on the outcome of elections.

In most cases, pollsters don’t make this data public, possibly because there
is greater value to be gained by selling it to interested parties. When such
data is occasionally released, however, it can provide significant insight.
And it is one such release that supports our hypothesis —CVoter’s exit poll
following the recent Karnataka assembly election.

In a series of tweets, CVoter founder Yashwant Deshmukh showed the voting
pattern by different demographic cuts, which made it clear that the BJP has
higher appeal among the younger voters, with the Congress’s vote share going
up as the voters got older. _(See Chart 1)_

So, why does the BJP have a demographic worry? Because India’s population is
not getting younger.

Using data from the 2011 census (the most recent such data available) and
actuarial tables (from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of
India (Irdai), we can project the expected population of different age groups
in 2019. Comparing it to the population distribution in the 2014 elections
(using similar data), it appears that India is getting marginally older.

Based on census data, the median age of the voter in the 2014 general
elections was 37.2, and this goes up to 38.0 in the 2019 general elections (we
assume that every voter who was aged 15 and above in the 2011 census was
eligible to vote in 2014. And that every voter aged 10 and above in 2011 will
vote next year, subject to survival).

In other words, the population of first-time voters in 2019 is not sufficient
to lower the average age given that everyone is now 5 years older (one caveat,
though, is that we use actuarial data to measure deaths, and since these are
based on people who are insured, there might be a slight bias).

And while the BJP still seems to be doing well in terms of attracting the
first-time voter (looking at the Karnataka data above), the question of
whether the party will continue to attract these voters as they get older
remains. While we don’t have longitudinal data (on whether people actually
switch away from the BJP as they get older—though some polling agencies might
have some of this data), the fact that the average voter is not getting
younger can be a source of worry for the BJP.

However, not all states are becoming older, or by an equal extent. Assuming
zero migration across states, the median voter in 2019 in Uttar Pradesh,
India’s largest state, will actually be younger than the median voter in the
state in 2014. The median age of the Bihar voter in 2019 is only marginally
higher than the median age in the state in 2014. They are both states that the
BJP did rather well in 2014. On the other hand, the median voter in Kerala,
which is India’s oldest state and where the BJP’s presence is negligible, has
got older by over a year. _(See Chart 2)_

What must also worry the BJP further is that India’s religious composition is
changing, and in a way that might affect the party adversely in the long run.
While the change in overall share of different religions between the 2014 and
2019 elections is negligible (proportion of Hindus comes down by 10 basis
points from 80.13% to 80.03%, while that of Muslims goes up by 15 basis points
from 13.76% to 13.91%), census 2011 data shows that nearly one-sixth of the
first-time voters in 2019 (people in the 10-14 age group in 2011) will be
people classified as “Muslim” by the census (_See Chart 3)_

The BJP definitely has something to worry about!

Yogi didn't become the CM in 2014 and Modi didn't become the PM in 2002. It takes time for things to happen.

&gt;In 1938, he wrote, ""if we Hindus in India grow stronger in time, these Moslem friends of the league type will have to play the part of German Jews."" He further added that India ""must be a Hindu land, reserved for Hindus"".[52

Modi has praised Savarkar many times.


Moreover whenever this issue is raised BJP leaders always call the other person anti-Hindu. When you say the Saffron terrorists had RSS connecntions then you are anti-Hindu. Gauri Lankesh killers had direct RSS connections and she was killed for a political reason but when this issue was raised BJP called the critics anti-Hindu. 

BJP spokespeople have attacked Tharoor as anti-Hindu and someone who ""loves Pakistan"". Subraminan Swamy has said Tharoor should go to Pakistan.

It seems logic is not the strong suit of these people. When he says he does not want India to become like Pakistan, how does it mean he ""loves Pakistan""?

Or BJP spokespeople feel the description of Pakistan as a ""Pakistan -- a state with a dominant majority religion that seeks to put its minorities in a subordinate place."" is somehow a positive description?'


I will note other incidents of BJP's real ideology here.

3. Because I agree that India really needs to librealize its economic policy, get rid of a lot of deadweight laws that make it difficult to live here. I also support his idea to remove income tax.

&gt; I will tell you why it is important. It shows that Chinese people are open to watching Bollywood movies. I think from watching those movies they understand India better. And by understanding each other better, we will be able to have greater trust between each other. That’s why these examples are very important. 

&gt; Global Times interviewed me and asked me questions like this, ‘why do Indian people not like China and why you dislike Chinese people?’ And I asked them ‘where did you get this idea from?

#**On Constitution and Congress:**

The initial fear propounded by Tharoor was BJP would tear up the Constitution and write a new one. In this classification, the entire tearing up and writing new Constitution have gone out of the window and it is about a vague putting Minorites in subordinate position. It is vague enough that no one understands what changes are to be made in Constitution but will generate enough fear among minorities. 

Given that BJP leadership in parliament has clearly stated that they will not change the Constitution, Tharoor needed to obfuscate by bringing about Pakistan, minorities etc. 

**Congress has introduced the 93rd amendment which clearly discriminates against non-minorities whereas all discussion on BJP changes to Constitution are wildly speculative.**

#**On Pakistan:**

Now, Tharoor describes Pakistan as a state that discriminates against minorities and denies them equal rights. Why does Tharoor want to give Pakistan and it's policies legitimacy by repeatedly demanding that we resume cricketing relationship with Pakistan ([2015](https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/grab-the-mauka-to-play-cricket-with-pakistan), [2017](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/delhi/litfest-delhi-2017-why-india-pakistan-need-to-play-gentlemans-game-often/amp_articleshow/61814296.cms))? Avocating [talks with Pakistan](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/talking-with-pakistanis-713250), state that discriminates against minorities and spreads terrorism? Surely, we shouldn't be encouraging such behaviour.

Does Tharoor plan to lecture the [artists and businessmen that he wants to invite](http://www.abplive.in/india-news/congress-mp-shashi-tharoor-favours-inviting-pakistani-artists-to-india-447885) on how they shouldn't discriminate against minorities? Tharoor plans to create a home away from home for Pakistani folks - not really conducive to a confrontation on Minority rights.

Tharoor has a problem with Pakistan when it comes to terrorism but he doesn't seem to think that discrimination against Minorites is a problem to resume cricket, inviting actors and artists, creating a home away from home etc. **It is clear that Tharoor doesn't have a problem with Pakistan but he has a problem with 'Hindu Pakistan'.

**Post Dinner, One-On-One Nitish Kumar-Amit Shah Meet Hints Reconciliation** 

 ______ 
Ties between the two main partners in Bihar's coalition government have been
on a slide for months

**New Delhi: **

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had laid out an extensive spread for his breakfast
and dinner meetings with BJP chief Amit Shah. On dinner table, the Mr Kumar
had laid out a fair mix of vegetarian delicacies from Bihar and Gujarat, Mr
Shah's home state. But food was the last thing on their minds as the two party
bosses, accompanied by senior leaders of their respective parties, sat down
for dinner.

Ties between the two main partners in Bihar's coalition government have been
on a slide for months. And it has only got worse in recent weeks, with leaders
from both sides flexing muscles to build the ground to seek a bigger share of
seats to field candidates in next year's general elections.

The discussion continued post dinner too, shifting to another room in Nitish
Kumar's official residence in state capital Patna. It is here that the two
leaders had their one-on-one meeting for about 20 minutes that is seen as an
indication that the reconciliation efforts were working.

Sources told NDTV that this was important, particularly since Nitish Kumar
hasn't been known to share a great relationship with Amit Shah. They have
hardly known each other.

The first time Janata Dal United chief had met the BJP's master strategist was
in August last year. It was a courtesy call. Nitish Kumar had just dumped the
grand alliance that included Lalu Yadav's party and the Congress and tied up
with BJP. That meeting took place in Delhi when Nitish Kumar came to call on
Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr Kumar had then returned with an offer to join
the NDA.

But his party has been upset that the central government was seen to be less
than enthusiastic to reward the Nitish Kumar-led government for teaming up
with the BJP last July. Bihar hasn't got the special package Nitish Kumar had
been eyeing and is perceived to have been given a raw deal when it came to
floods for flood relief too.

It is not clear if some of this could still change.

But a JDU leader told NDTV that there appeared to be better appreciation in
the BJP about Nitish Kumar's stand on the ticket distribution after
yesterday's meetings. The feedback that Mr Shah received during the day from
his party on contesting the Lok Sabha elections along with Nitish Kumar's
party could have helped.

It hadn't also gone unnoticed in the JDU camp how Amit Shah had, to their
surprise, showered unequivocal wholesome praise at Chief Minister Nitish
Kumar's track record in governance.

A BJP leader said Nitish Kumar's party has conveyed that it could not settle
for anything less than 15 of the 40 seats. This means that the BJP, which won
the biggest share of the Lok Sabha seats in 2014, would have to give up its
claim on quite some seats to accommodate Nitish Kumar's JDU.

__

Nitish Kumar's party had won only two seats in the 2014 elections when the JDU
and the BJP contested the election separately. The NDA, in contrast, had
cornered a whopping 31 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats; 22 by the BJP alone.

130,"&gt; **That Tamil Nadu is infested with extremists has been Pon Radhakrishnan's pet theory for over one-and-a-half years**. The Union minister's regret is that neither the AIADMK government nor the police or its intelligence wing has taken him seriously. His latest peeve seems to arise from the opposition by farmers to the Salem-Chennai 277 kilometre-long eight-lane expressway. Many farmers are miffed that their lands are being taken away to build a greenfield expressway when the existing 4-lane highways could be widened.

&gt; ... Why Radhakrishnan needs to be taken seriously is because **he is a member of the Narendra Modi government**. The question to be asked, therefore, is that when the minister says that such a government 'is not required', is he reflecting New Delhi's opinion that the state government should be shown the door? Is the home ministry convinced that the law and order situation in Tamil Nadu has gone for a toss? **Has the MHA shared information with the Tamil Nadu government through official channels on the extremist elements operating in the state? Tamil Nadu minister D Jayakumar has, in fact, asked Radhakrishnan to share information with the state, if he has any**.

&gt; ... **how responsible is it for a Union minister to float his conspiracy theories** about the probability of a Naxal presence in the media? ... 

&gt; **A closer look at the kind of people who have been arrested in the last one week would give a fair idea about why the 'urban Naxals' theory has been floated**. These include advocate Vachinathan, who has been providing legal assistance to the **protesters against Sterlite in Tuticorin, lakes activist Piyush Munush, student activist Valarmathi and actor Mansoor Khan, who are all opposed to the Salem project**. In addition, some 260 people have been arrested in Tuticorin and charged with having taken part in the violence on 22 May. Any farmer who has objected to their land being marked for acquisition for the highway has been detained at the local police station.

&gt; Naxals are usually known to dispense justice in their kangaroo courts. **The irony is that here, those in the establishment are employing the same modus operandi using social media, especially Twitter, to label people as urban Naxals, church operatives and anti-national**. Piyush is described as an extortionist, Valarmathi as a Naxalite and Vanchinathan as a riot conspirator, to say they are not above board.

&gt; This is not to say that the state is not within its rights to arrest anyone who is seen under the law as a threat to public peace. **It is the pattern that is disturbing. The arrests seem to send out the message that anyone who dissents may be taken into custody**.

&gt; **A senior IPS officer who has spent over two decades battling Naxalism in the red corridor** in states like Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, **denies that there is any military footprint of the Maoists in Tamil Nadu**.

&gt; ""There could be at best, some occasional movement in the Tamil Nadu-Kerala zone. But at the moment, **the Naxal card seems to be used as a bogey,"" he says**.

&gt; **It would seem that whoever speaks for the people and for the protection of human rights is branded as an urban Naxal**. Fathima Babu, who has been spearheading the agitation against the polluting Sterlite plant, says the crackdown makes people scared about taking on a powerful corporate and the state.

&gt; **""Piyush's image is being tarnished, just like mine was sought to be. I was born and brought up in Tuticorin and yet**, I was shocked to hear the kind of slander I was subjected to,'' says Fathima.

**If NDA loses, rural distress will be a key factor: Yogendra Yadav** 

 ______ 
Yogendra Yadav, farmer leader and president of Swaraj India. Photo: Pradeep
Gaur/Mint

**New Delhi:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s will to win elections is forcing him to court farmers but end-of-term promises may not yield electoral dividends, says Yogendra Yadav, farmer leader and president of Swaraj India. Edited excerpts from an interview:

**The centre recently hiked minimum support price (MSP) significantly and promised to ensure procurement of pulses and oilseeds. Do you think it will help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politically?**

It is quite clear that the Prime Minister is concerned about farmers. To put
it more bluntly he is concerned about farmers’ votes. To put it even more
bluntly he is scared after Gujarat and after the by-election results. He is
not politically naive... he can sense it that he could be looking at a defeat
or at least a substantial setback enough to put him and the National
Democratic Alliance (NDA) in minority in the coming (general) elections and
the principal cause would be rural distress. It is quite clear that Modi is
going all out now to address that.

However, I remain sceptical. Historically we know whatever the government does
in the fifth year does not affect election results very much. It also all
depends on actual delivery and that’s not going to be easy because announcing
MSP in New Delhi is one thing, delivering it to the farmer in the mandi is
quite a task. In large parts of the country the institutional mechanism for
delivering MSP does not exist... to create it overnight is not going to be
easy.

**Do you expect farmers to vote in a block in the coming elections?**

The task to bring them together as one single block is politically very
difficult. The reason is the sheer diversity of Indian agriculture.

**Will agrarian crisis impact polls in Madhya Pradesh (MP), Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan?**

I don’t see anything dramatically different in these three states that
separate them from the rest of the country but for the electoral calendar.
Chhattisgarh’s only claim to fame has been its ability to deliver PDS (public
distribution system) in a way which is relatively better than others. But
that’s an old claim, they have already won two elections on that and you can’t
win again on that one claim.

The MP government clearly faces a very serious challenge. This arises from the
fact that our agriculture policy has been production oriented. So a state can
keep getting Krishi Karman Awards, as MP has got repeatedly, but these awards
are all about production levels. We have not so far developed a crude index of
what these things do to the producer. After travelling in MP, my own sense is
that it hasn’t resulted in very much. There is resentment, unhappiness. Given
the firing in Mandsaur, and subsequent events, the only respite Shivraj Singh
Chouhan has had is that he has benefitted from a completely incompetent
opposition which is inert and reactive.

In Rajasthan I see almost nothing going in the BJP’s favour. Vasundhara Raje
has been an imperious chief minister who has no understanding or a desire to
address the plight of farmers.

**Is farm distress a major issue in the elections?**

The fact that farmer movements have been so lacklustre over the last 20
years... one of the effects of a weak movement is that people slip back into
fatalism. But things are beginning to change. The farmers are now aware of the
promises and hold leaders accountable.

If there was a strong political party which could hold a credible promise of
addressing farm distress then it could become very, very big in the country.
But I think the BJP’s best friend has been the Congress party in this respect.

 ______ 
**New Delhi: **

The Congress party made a blooper when they tagged actress Priyanka Chopra in
a tweet, instead of their spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi.

The Congress yesterday took to Twitter to blame Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
as they alleged him of lying about the soil testing labs, which gives soil
health report to the farmers.

""PM Modi is lying about Soil Testing Labs too. During UPA regime there were
1141 Soil testing laboratories: @priyankachopra"", the party tweeted.

The official handle of the Congress later deleted the tweet.

__

Soil testing labs are set up to provide farmers with soil health cards, which
in turn would help them decide the quality of their products they normally
grow.

**SpaceX, Tesla chief Elon Musk to visit India; check probable date** 

 ______ 
Notably, this will not be Musk’s first visit to India. In 2007, Musk had
attended the International Astronautical Congress held in Hyderabad.

SpaceX Chief Elon Musk may well be visiting India soon. Yes, this information
was revealed by the chief executive of US-based electric car major Tesla.
Replying to a tweet, Musk has expressed his plan to visit the country. The
date, itinerary and details are yet to be finalised. This has come months
after Tesla had said that it was not being able to enter India owing to
“challenging government regulations”. “Would love to be in India. Some
challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is
from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should,” Musk had
tweeted in May in a reply to a query about the automaker’s absence from the
Indian market.

Notably, this will not be Musk’s first visit to India. In 2007, Musk had
attended the International Astronautical Congress held in Hyderabad. Musk, who
loves Indian cuisine, has expressed his desire to visit India. While everyone
is eager to know about the date, timing and schedule of his visit, Musk has
given a hint about the possible itinerary of his trip to India. When asked
about his plans about visiting India, Musk said, “prob early next year”.

Musk and Tesla have time to time expressed their interests to enter India but
their entry has always met roadblocks. In 2014, Tesla had said it was keen to
enter the Indian market and even identified the country as one of the possible
locations to set up a manufacturing plant in Asia. It, however, said high duty
on imported vehicles and lack of a separate category for electric cars
prevented it from selling vehicles here despite having a huge potential. Tesla
had again stated that it planned to enter India with its Model 3 in 2017 while
it began global rollout of the vehicle in late 2016.

In September 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited Tesla’s facility
in San Jose and showed a keen interest in some of their path-breaking
inventions, particularly in the renewable energy sector which can have
multiple applications in remote rural areas. The PM had also met Musk.

**Nothing**. And that's why people are angry and voting for the opposition - Modi and BJP have gained the same perception of supporting the corrupt as the UPA was tainted with. 

The difference is that while the UPA took all the corruption cases seriously and investigated them and even filed chargesheet and prosecuted them, India has never seen someone so blatantly and openly corrupt as our present PM Narendra Modi.

A PM who openly flaunts and shamelessly claims that his 15+ lakh suit-boots and designer watches are ""just gifts"" from his corporate buddies clearly highlights how corrupt power has blinded him that he thinks indian voters are fool (probably confuses the voters with his *bhakths*).

&gt; The arguments to remove Section 377 from the Indian Penal Code and establish equality before the law for all sexes have been completed. On Friday, the arguments in favour of keeping the 1861-era colonial law will be heard. The Supreme Court bench has allotted five minutes for every petitioner who supports the clause, which comes to a total of 1.5 hours.

&gt; It seems all over bar the shouting. The Centre has already indicated through its additional solicitor-general Tushar Mehta that it will not contest a possible Supreme Court decision to decriminalise gay consensual sex.

&gt; So how did the government get here? Only five years ago, in 2013, BJP leader, and now home minister Rajnath Singh, said that the party would not allow homosexuality to be decriminalised. So what happened last week that persuaded the BJP to recognise changing social mores in India and soften its own hardline position?

&gt; The answer is Arun Jaitley. The minister-without-portfolio has for some time been going against his party’s grain and arguing that Section 377 should be scrapped, and that it doesn’t behove a government to look inside a citizen’s bedroom.

&gt; In the last few days, even in his semi-medical isolation, Jaitley is believed to have pushed for a debate across the senior BJP leadership.

&gt; According to a source, “The discussion went all the way to the PMO, to the Prime Minister himself.”

&gt; It was pointed out that none other than senior RSS leader Dattatreya Hosabale had said at the India Today Conclave in March 2016 that gay consensual sex should not be criminalised.

&gt; The Prime Minister may have realised that the international community was watching. Several countries that Modi has travelled to over the last four years – and several leaders that he will meet in the upcoming BRICS and G-20 summits – believe that gay consensual sex is normal.

&gt; India was becoming an outlier. It could not uphold principles that belonged to the dark ages. Even Britain, which had introduced this law in 1861 (in pursuit of its own 1533 Buggery Act), had long moved on.

&gt; Moreover, people’s voices had to be considered. If the BJP wanted to go into the elections as a party which responds to the needs of the people, there was no better way of demonstrating this.

&gt; Best of all, there was the opportunity to be one up on the Congress. Rahul Gandhi and his ilk may shout against Section 377 as much as they like today, but why didn’t the UPA opt for an amendment to do away with the archaic law after the review petition was shot down?

&gt; True, Hosabale had also said that scrapping Section 377 should not lead to gay marriage, and the institution of heterosexual marriage must remain sacrosanct. The RSS still held on to its belief that same-sex love was a foreign import and would harm traditional Indian values.

&gt; So over the last few days, as the senior BJP leadership discussed the matter, sources said, it was clear the “BJP had evolved”.

&gt; ASG Tushar Mehta’s instructions to follow a middle path are interesting. He told the Supreme Court that he would speak on the limited mandate of the matter at hand. This shows that while the government is in favour of going along with the Supreme Court on decriminalising gay consensual sex, it does not believe that the matter should be pursued any further, certainly not towards marriage or inheritance issues.

&gt; Mehta’s comments certainly reflect the party’s thinking and, indeed, that of the Prime Minister.

&gt; But the genie may already be out of the bottle. If the Supreme Court bench not only reads up the petition, but also takes a judgement call on Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 guaranteed to every citizen – which are, the right to equality before the law, prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, the freedom of speech and expression, and the right to life and liberty – then Section 377 will not only be deleted from the Constitution, but all other rights will also be given to the LGBTQ community.

&gt; If the Supreme Court takes this radical step, the BJP will accept it. To its core, the right-wing voter, it will argue that it has no option; after all, how can it go against the highest court of the land?

&gt; That is why the PM and his party’s position on taking the middle path on Section 377 this week is a smart one. Not speaking up forcefully might seem like an abdication of responsibility. It is, instead, a guaranteed win-win political move.

&gt; Modi can pat himself on the back for this one.",2018-07-14 23:28:43

&gt;Because you don't have to agree with everything about another country when you're considering diplomatic relations with them.
&gt;
&gt;Why should we care what Pakistan does to it's minorities if we can benefit from better relations with them?
&gt;
&gt;Why do you think America allies with the Saudis? Because they like how the Saudis treat migrant workers?

If American president)/secy of state goes back to USA after allying with Saudi and states we shouldn't be like Saudi, then he would be panned. Trump gets panned for criticizing allies on topics such as immigration, defense spending etc, forget telling Americans that they shouldn't be like their allies.

Tharoor is not talking of better diplomatic relations. He is talking of cricket ties, welcoming Pakistani actors and businessmen etc. The appropriate comparison would be apartheid South Africa. This is similar to a politician stating India should not be a brown apartheid SA but continues to want cricket ties and encourage actors and business from white SA community and wants to create a home away from home for them.

Tharoor in his writings also highlights the concerns about terrorism emanating from Pakistan(he feels suspending cricket ties is like giving a veto to extremists) but doesn't express any concern for minorites of Pakistan. 

&gt;
&gt;Look I'm not a fan of Tharoor but what you're doing here is peculiar, I'm not sure how best to explain it to you. You are quibbling over useless semantics and probably intentionally ignoring the bigger picture.

You don't seem to grasp the meaning of semantics. If you think Constitution can be changed by Majority in next elections, I have a marble tomb to sell in Agra. You need 2/3 majority in both houses, half of state legislatures and then convince court to overthrow ""basic structure"" doctrine - would need at least 15 judge SC bench as basic structure was given by 13 judge bench. Just yesterday, supreme court overthrew a request by Maharashtra govt to allow reservation for SC/ST in minority colleges - by looking at article 15(5) in the context of 15(4) but courts refused. You might not be aware of the process to bring constitutional amendments but Tharoor does know. It isn't easy to make minor changes in Constitution, forget an entire rewrite. 

The whole argument of how changes to Constitution are made, what changes to Constitution have been made by BJP till date (GST, NJAC and land deal with Bangladesh) vs changes made by UPA (93rd amendment which introduced article 15(5) and provided minority exemption from reservations and RTE), Modi, venkiah Naidu and jaitley assurances to parliament to not change the Constitution etc have been detailed by me in various comments on this post.

**India's growth at risk if Modi is not re-elected: John Chambers** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: India's ""impressive development and inclusive growth"" stand at
risk if Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

does not get a chance to lead the country after the next year's parliamentary
elections, a top US industrialist has said.

John Chambers, a former executive chairman and CEO of

CISCO Systems

told a group of Indian reporters told India has a chance to be the strongest
growth-inclusive country in the world.

""To do that takes at least a decade to put in place. I think your prime
minister Modi has to capability of doing it. I think he has the country headed
in the right way,"" he said.

""I think it would be a major risk not to give him a chance to finish that
vision,"" Chambers said yesterday on the sidelines of the inaugural Annual
Leadership Summit of the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF)
here of which he is the chairman.

He was responding to a question what if Modi is not re-elected in the 2019
elections. ""He (Modi) is courageous. He wakes up every day thinking about your
country's future,"" he said.

Responding to a question on India US relationship, there is huge potential in
this bilateral relationship. ""The impact of this is going to be so large for
both nations that you will not find small bumps on the way to distract us,"" he
said.

Point 2 - It doesn't even seem a particularly popular movie, barely any reviews on IMDB. It's nowhere near comparable to a Netflix show that is being broadcasted across the world and is quite popular.

If a Gujarat 2002 riot documentary was released and only a few thousand watched it, you think Modi would care?

If a Gujarat 2002 riot documentary was released and it was watched avidly across the world, would the situation change entirely? 

Are you seriously comparing the two situations? Obtuse. 

Point 3 - I'm expanding on my comment on his maturity, not ""redefining"" it. It is possible that there are other reasons as to why I find him and his comments immature. 

Like I said, don't bring up some obscure documentary. 

The situation will be replicated when there is a popular documentary that delves into Rajiv's corruption with regards to Bofors, his merciless streak when thousands were being slaughtered in Delhi and his utter tragic intervention in Sri Lanka and that it becomes a very popular show on Netflix broadcasting to tens of millions.

**PM Narendra Modi launches 340-km Purvanchal Expressway, says it will transform areas in eastern UP** 

 ______ 
AZAMGARH: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

today laid the foundation stone for the Rs 23,000 crore Purvanchal highway,
saying it will transform the places it passes through.

Hours before the inauguration of the project, Samajwadi Party chief dismissed
it as a ""relaunch"" of a project which he had inaugurated as the previous chief
minister of the state.

At his public meeting here, Modi described the occasion as the beginning of a
new chapter in the development of the state, particularly its eastern part.

He showered praise on the leadership of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and
said the state government was working to create an atmosphere conducive for
development.

""The 340-km

Purvanchal Expressway

will transform the towns and cities that it passes through. It would also
provide swifter connectivity between Delhi and Ghazipur. New industry and
institutions can develop along the expressway,"" he said.

After becoming prime minister, this was Modi's first public appearance in
Azamgarh, which has proved a challenge to the BJP. The party swept the 2014

Lok Sabha

election in UP but lost the

Azamgarh

seat to former Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.

The prime minister said the expressway will also boost tourism at places of
historical significance.

Modi stressed that connectivity was necessary for development and said the
national highway network in UP had almost doubled in the last four years.

He reiterated his vision of ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"", and spoke about
development initiatives such as PM Awas Yojana and PM Gram Sadak Yojana.

He said the recent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) of kharif crops
will immensely benefit farmers and also mentioned the Centre's initiatives for
weavers in this region.

The six-lane Purvanchal Expressway, expandable to eight lanes, will connect
Lucknow with the economically less developed districts like Azamgarh, Mau,
Ghazipur, Faizabad, Sultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar and Amethi.

The expressway will bring about development of UP's eastern districts by
connecting them to the state capital and further to Agra and New Delhi,
through the Lucknow-Agra Expressway and the

Yamuna Expressway

, officials said.

The expressway will begin from Chand Sarai village on Lucknow-Sultanpur road
(NH 731) and end at Haidariya village in Ghazipur district, about 18 km from
the UP-Bihar order.

another issue where he has been more or less silent is aadhaar. there have been a few statements here and there. but no clear cut policy. 

and of course... he is a complete failure when it comes to congress being the largest opposition party in the parliament. bjp has gone away with so much stuff that it is embarrassing. modi ji lied just yesterday in a public speech and i have not seen anything except a few comments here and there. why are there no lawsuits being filed? 

congress can surely do with spending some of their budget on releasing a daily ad in paper highlighting all the lies spoken by bjp politicians the previous day. and using the arsenal of lawyers in their party to keep targeting the government in courts for every defamatory statement. 

also congress has not said much against the one nation one poll thing that is being pushed by the bjp government. it's clear that they are also in favor of it as it puts them at an advantage compared to regional parties. ",2018-07-15 10:01:47

of course, it's one thing to say these things when you are not in power. so there's that. i mean just look at the statements made by modi ji when he was gujarat cm. so yeah... one has to be cautious while taking these statements seriously. ",2018-07-15 10:04:57

**Instead of cleaning Ganga people in previous governments increased personal wealth, says Modi** 

 ______ 
VARANASI: Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

attacked previous governments on the issue of river Ganga and said, “The issue
of Pravah (uninterrupted flow) and Nirmalta (free from pollution) in Ganga
continued becoming complicated in previous governments. However, instead of
improvement in condition of Ganga personal wealth of those in power continued
increasing in the name of cleaning Ganga.”

Though Modi did not talk about measures being initiated for Pravah in Ganga,
he said, “Over 200 projects being run between Gangotri and Ganga Sagar with a
budget of Rs 21000 crores by his government will start yielding results soon.
It will be evident to the people of country as well as Kashi. The government
is not only ensuring construction of sewage treatment plants to check disposal
of sewage in Ganga but also ensuring that new STPs are running uninterruptedly
for at least 15 years.”

Addressing a public meeting organised to mark the inauguration of 21 completed
projects and foundation laying of 12 projects of Rs 937 crores at Kachnar
village in Rajatalab area on Saturday late afternoon Modi said, “Previous
government spent huge money in the name of cleaning Ganga but failed to put
check on increasing pollution in the river.” He said that the people should
not forget the deteriorated condition of ghats, when even solid waste was
disposed in river Ganga, four years back.

Modi said, “After formation of government at centre in 2014 we had been facing
challenges in executing development projects till the

BJP

came to power after 2017 assembly polls as previous government was hurdling
all center funded projects.” He said that BJP governments are working with a
vision of `transformation through transportation’ as a part of which the roads
in Varanasi are widened and improved. He said that the Purvnachal Express, for
which he laid foundation in

Azamgarh

, is also the part of same vision as his government is focusing on improving
basic infrastructure in eastern parts of the country.

Thaking his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe the PM said that following his
Varanasi visit Abe had gifted Varanasi International Cooperation and
Convention Center (VCC) and the work on this project is starting with Rs 180
crores. He said that not only Abe but even French president consider the
welcome accorded by them from the people of Varanasi as unforgettable. He
asked the people of city to get ready to welcome non-resident Indians from
across the globe congregating here for a convention between January 21 and 23.
“I will also be here on January 21 to welcome thousands of NRIs with you”, he
said.

On Sunday, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj was trolled on Twitter
following a controversy involving the issuance of passport to an inter-faith
couple. To share with the world what she saw on her feed, the minister “liked”
over 200 tweets — which anyone can look by clicking the “likes” tab on her
Twitter profile.

A Hindustan Times analysis revealed that 41 BJP parliamentarians, who are
either ministers in the union cabinet or elected MPs to the Lok Sabha, follow
at least one of the accounts that tweeted out a message which Swaraj had liked
to showcase trolling.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi follows eight of those accounts.

To be sure, there’s nothing to suggest that just because Swaraj’s cabinet and
parliamentary colleagues follow these accounts, they endorse the tweets posted
against the external affairs minister.

Previously, Amit Malviya, head of BJP’s IT cell, has said, “PM following
someone is not a character certificate of the person, and is not in any way a
guarantee of how the person would conduct himself.”

The 211 tweets listed by Swaraj came from 169 accounts. 18 of these accounts
are followed by at least one BJP parliamentarian.

“I was out of India from 17th to 23rd June 2018. I do not know what happened
in my absence. However, I am honoured with some tweets. I am sharing them with
you. So I have liked them,” Swaraj tweeted Sunday.

Which tweets should be classified as trolling or not is subjective and often
debatable, but this is among the first time concerns regarding “hateful”
messages in the Indian Twittersphere have been raised by a cabinet minister.

The list which the Hindustan Times looked at was curated by Swaraj herself. No
modification was made to retain Swaraj’s judgement about the nature of tweets.

The current controversy erupted when Vikas Mishra, an officer in the regional
passport office of Lucknow was transferred after he allegedly humiliated Tanvi
Seth and Anas Siddique, a Hindu-Muslim couple.

According to reports, he had asked the woman to change her name and her
husband to convert to Hinduism. Mishra has contested the allegations of
misbehaviour.

258,"&gt; What makes you state people are angry and voting for the opposition?

They are losing elections dude. The BJP is even in a losing streak in UP where it just got a huge majority recently. That indicates how badly Modi and Yogi have screwed up. 

&gt; Who got the highest number of votes in Karnataka?

The Indian National Congress actually. They got more votes than the BJP.

&gt; Why don't you see the development that is happening

Changing names of UPA schemes, spending money on publicising them and then implementing them after cutting funds is not development. ""Development"" without peace of mind is no development. ""Development"" that makes our corrupt PM, and frieds of the BJP, richer, at our expense is not the ""development model"" we indans want.

&gt; When Digvijay Singh was the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, I remember how pathetic the situation of the state was!

I am sure it had poor infrastructure (and still has when compared to the southern states). And yet, Bihar and MP have developed only in the last 2 decades because our economy started booming in the last 3 decades and these state government got huge funds to develop the infrastructure. While Lalu Prasad Yadav and Digvijay Singh may have lacked the funds to develop their state's infrastructure, their government worked towards the social upliftment of weaker sections of society and they did credible work towards that end. They also ensured that development was equitable and everybody benefited, not just the rich. And they ensured that communal forces never got an upper hand in society. Something that ALL BJP states have failed to do with the result that RSS *goondas* rule the roost in many BJP constituency.

&gt; What has Mamta done so good in West Bengal? 

I don't know - but she restored the rights of the farmers over their land in Singoor, is trying to revive the manufacturing industry and has ensured that the RSS / BJP don't destroy the social fabric of her state by provoking communal incidents. That's a huge plus in my books.

&gt; Kerala has been free of BJP, what development has happened there?

Despite the best efforts of Modi/RSS/BJP, the Kerala government has ensured that the state has had no communal incidents and everyone feels secure there. I was recently in Kochi and the Metro built there is fantastic. I was told it was built in record time when considering other similar projects in India. Flyover works are going on at a fast pace, and again are one of the fastest in India. It has one of the largest mall (Lulu) in south asia, and 3 more malls are coming up there. 

&gt; Don't you appreciate the work the government has done in linking everything up with Aadhar cards?

No. *Adhaar* is being converted from an identity based project to something that can be used for surveillance and government monitoring of all aspects of our life. 

&gt; Your argument over the PM flaunting his suit-boots is outright stupid.

More stupid is trying to claim that a bribe is a ""gift""!

&gt; Do you have any idea over the amount of foreign investment that the PM has brought in? 

Sure, heard a lot of *jumlas* on these. Have yet to see any of it. Why don't you enlighten us to it? Oh, by the way, remember not to go the Gujarat model way when you give examples - give us the actual money invested in India, and not those mentioned in paper.

&gt; Have you ever seen him travelling (like the Canada PM) to tourist spots during his visit to other countries?

Yes, many times. In fact that's what he does all the time abroad in the name of ""diplomacy"" - letting the foreign government and businessmen wine and dine him.

&gt; Did you see the way the PM conducted himself in G20 summit and the amount of respect he has overseas?

Everyone knows that he is a meglomaniac. So naturally all the foreign dignitaries shower him with praise and lavish attention on him to get what they want. And it works. What you think is ""respect"" is just plain old diplomacy.

True respect is what Dr. Manmohan Singh commanded as an economist. And that is why he was able to get us the nuclear deal with US and the rest of the world.

&gt; It's funny that you support politicians out on bail (Soni,Rahul,Chidambaram) and criticize the PM. 

And yet, none of them have been chargesheeted for any crime yet. You'd think the BJP would do that after coming to power as they have been claiming to have proof of their corruption for decades now.

**For Shivaji memorial, Maharashtra makes sculpture shorter, sword taller** 

 ______ 
Written by

Vishwas Waghmode

| Mumbai |

Updated: July 16, 2018 6:54:41 am

Concept plan of the Shivaji Memorial.

In a bid to bring down the cost of constructing the proposed statue of
Chhatrapati Shivaji in the sea off Mumbai, the Maharashtra government has
tweaked the design so that the height of the warrior king is now 7.5 metres
shorter than originally proposed, although the sword he wields will be taller
than in the original design.

The project, a flagship programme of the BJP-led government in the state, saw
Prime Minister Narendra Modi lay the foundation stone for the memorial and a
‘jal poojan’ in December 2016.

Documents accessed by The Indian Express under the Right to Information (RTI)
Act show that the state government had originally proposed a statue standing
121.2 metres tall, including the sculpture of the king on his horse together
measuring 83.2 metres, and a 38-metre sword. The equestrian statue is to be
cast in bronze on a pedestal, designed as a multi-storey structure, standing
88.8 metres tall. In total, the project height was 210 metres.

This year, as part of cost-reduction measures on the project, the height of
the sculpture of the warrior king on his steed has been reduced to 75.7 metres
and the length of the sword raised to 45.5 metres, maintaining the statue
height of 121.2 metres.

As part of cost-reduction measures on the project, the height of the sculpture
of the warrior king on his steed has been reduced to 75.7 metres and the
length of the sword raised to 45.5 metres, maintaining the statue height of
121.2 metres.

The original base length of the sculpture was also proportionally reduced to
maintain the aesthetic view of the statue. This has resulted in reduced
anticipated use of bronze, tertiary steel elements and armature. Overall,
these changes and a few others have led to a cost reduction of Rs 338.94
crore.

A week after the government issued a Letter of Acceptance for the project to
Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, opposition parties had alleged the state government had
reduced the height of the Shivaji statute in order to cut costs, while
increasing the pedestal height. The government denied the allegations,
maintaining that the height of the statue remains 121.2 metres. “I have
written to the consultant, the contractor and PWD officials asking for a
presentation on how cost reduction has been achieved,” said Vinayak Mete,
legislator and Chairman of the Project Implementation and Monitoring Committee
for the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial.

Meanwhile, the state government last month decided that the total height of
the project would be 212 metres, making it the tallest statue in the world.
The equestrian sculpture portion will now be made proportionately taller by 2
metres and a proposal submitted to the MoEF for clearances, said sources in
the PWD.

On March 1 this year, the state government issued a Letter of Acceptance to
L&amp;amp;T for the project worth Rs 2,500 crore plus GST, taking the total
project cost to Rs 2,800 crore. In December last year, the government decided
to go in for cost optimisation measures to reduce the total project cost from
Rs 3,826 crore, the sum originally quoted by L&amp;amp;T. Various cost
optimisation measures have led to cost reduction to the tune of Rs 1,026
crore.

Records show that apart from cost reduction in the statue itself, cost has
also been reduced in other ways. The government has, for example, deferred the
first year operation and maintenance and training cost of the project. Some
deleted items include a VIP jetty and a safe house for VIPs.

The marine works broadly comprise breakwaters, island reclamation, a sea wall
designed to appear as a historic fort wall, a passenger jetty, etc. The
pedestal will house various visitor management spaces, a museum and art
gallery, food court and viewing deck.

Let me put what you have said

&gt;Be it the Kathua case, Adhaar, or Karnataka elections, he unequivocally blamed the PM for it

- Kathua

BJP MLAs supported the accused and took out rallies in support of him. BJP's IT cell and the support system claimed all kinds of conspiracy theories and even resorted to whataboutism. Whataboutism over a rape of an 8 year old girl.

Modi spoke only after hell froze over him. His statement was still not sensitive enough nor did it stop his party members from making outrageous claims.

This is not like blaming me for an earthquake in Japan.

- Aadhaar

The central government tried to force aadhaar on its citizens without any concern for data protection, privacy or even the execution issues. Who else will you criticise? Nehru?

This is not like blaming me for an earthquake in Japan.

- Karnataka

Karnataka's election was the most vilest in recent times. BJP used governor's office to grab power. Governor reports to the Central govt.

274,"&gt; The MSP for eligible crops is declared by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The CACP has three different definitions of productions costs – A2 (actual paid out cost), A2+FL (actual paid out cost plus imputed value of family labour) and C2 (comprehensive cost including imputed rent and interest on owned land and capital). As is evident, C2 &gt; A2+FL &gt; A2.

&gt; “When Modi claims that he has raised MSPs to 1.5 times cost of production, he is referring to the A2+FL cost and not the C2 cost, which is the comprehensive cost of production referred to in the Swaminathan Commission report,” said Yadav. “So take the price of paddy. The A2+FL cost for paddy is Rs 1,166 per quintal. Its C2 cost is Rs 1,560 per quintal. The MSP per quintal announced for 2018-19 is Rs 1,750. However, according to the formula of the Swaminathan Commission, the MSP should ideally be C2+50%, which is Rs 2,340. So it is evident that the Modi government’s promise of increasing MSPs to 1.5 times cost of production is, in fact, a historic betrayal.”

Giving 50% assured return on total cost (even the current msp increase will do the below but a much lower level) 

A) increase inflation especially on food products

B) increase production of commodities which have MSP and reduce production of other produce including vegetables

C) slow down the process of urbanisation and migration of farm labor to industries. The rural areas of India are not some utopia as shown in movies - they are places with little social and economic mobility and high levels of poverty.

D) increase budget deficit, which will increase govt bonds and increase inflation and hence higher loan rates

E) Land lease costs will increase as landowners would want to capture the higher income

What we should actually do is

A) we have surplus of grains. MSP should have been reduced for grains

B) allow exports of all agro produce including sugar and onions

C) if farmers are still insistent, govt should reduce the quantity procured - of 1000 tons were procured at X price, for 1.5x price, govt should procure 667 tons

D) Use Telangana scheme of rewarding land owners directly instead of trying to manipulate market prices

Given elections in a year, govt won't to do anything",2018-07-16 12:57:12

**Will 'Hindu-Muslim' Talk Make India Number 1, Arvind Kejriwal Asks PM** 

 ______ 
Arvind Kejriwal's remarks came a day after the PM asked if the Congress was a
party for Muslim men alone

**Indore: **

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday the BJP government at the
centre had achieved nothing if Prime Minister Narendra Modi was talking about
the ""Hindu-Muslim"" issue after four years in office.

Mr Kejriwal's remarks came a day after the Prime Minister, during a rally in
Uttar Pradesh's Azamgarh, asked if the Congress was a party for Muslim men
alone.

""If Modi is talking about Hindu-Muslims even after four years, it means his
government has achieved nothing,"" Mr Kejriwal said at the Aam Aadmi Party's
state-level convention in Indore.

PM Modi had on Saturday attacked opposition parties, particularly the
Congress, over what he claimed was their opposition to the triple talaq bill.

The Delhi chief minister asked the Prime Minister if talking about Hindus and
Muslims would help India become the number one country in the world.

PM Modi was harping on the Hindu-Muslim issue when the US was talking about
nanotechnology, and Japan, France and England were pursuing ""big
technologies"", Mr Kejriwal said.

The Delhi chief minister said that education alone would make India ""number
one"" and alleged that no government at the Centre had worked earnestly for the
education sector in the last 70 years.

""Indians are the wisest people in the world. But due to dirty politics, a
large number of people are being intentionally kept illiterate,"" he claimed.

**Modi government is doing a rethink on hounding of ordinary taxpayers** 

 ______ 
After drilling fear in taxpayers through increased scrutiny in the last few
years, the

Narendra Modi

government is now cracking down on ""tax terrorism"", the hounding of ordinary
taxpayers by the tax department. However, this doesn't mean the government has
stopped its war on tax evasion. It has decided to focus on the big fish
instead.

Recently, the chief of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) — the finance
ministry arm which serves as the apex body for

Income tax

(I-T) — directed all principal chief (I-T) commissioners to closely monitor
and resolve all cases of ""highpitched"" (unreasonable) tax demands. These cases
pertain to aggressive demands made by tax assessing officers (AOs) — often
driven by stiff targets — on frivolous grounds or due to non-observance of
principles of natural justice, non-application of mind and gross negligence.

Addressing the heads of different tax circles in an internal note dated July
4, 2018, CBDT chairman Sushil Chandra said that wherever local committees —
which were formed to look into complaints of tax payers — have taken a view
that a tax assessment is indeed ‘high-pitched’, the AOs should be asked to
give explanation.

And significantly, wherever required such AOs should be transferred to
“nonsensitive posts” within the city and “appropriate disciplinary action”
should be initiated, said Chandra. In his letter, Chandra categorically
instructs the principal chief commissioners that “no coercive action should be
taken for recovery of demand in cases which have been identified as high-
pitched by the local committees”.

The tax department also wants to shed the tag of compulsive litigant and focus
only on select high-value cases. The government has decided to sharply
increase the monetary thresholds at various levels – in the courts and
appellate tribunals – to cut down on litigation, a measure that will reduce
the number of appeals against adverse rulings.

The threshold for cases in the Supreme Court will be increased to Rs 1 crore
from Rs 25 lakh, while for the high courts, the level will more than double to
Rs 50 lakh from Rs 20 lakh under the rationalisation exercise that will apply
to both direct and indirect taxes.

Under the new rules, 54% of the appeals filed by the Central Board of Direct
Taxes will be withdrawn. The reduction of appeals by the Central Board of
Indirect Taxes and Customs in the Supreme Court will be 21%

""Government's decision of withdrawing cases and increasing the threshold limit
for filing appeals in various courts will improve Ease of Doing Business and
Ease of Living. The move will also help in reducing tax litigation,"" tweeted
Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways and Coal with a temporary charge of the
finance ministry, two days ago.

""Tax terrorism"" had become a commonly used term to describe rampant harassment
by the tax department under the previous United Progressive Alliance regime.
The

Modi government

had promised to provide a non-adversarial tax regime and unveiled a slew of
steps to shed this tag.

**How can the Congress shed its 'Muslim party' image?** 

 ______ 
**_By Amulya Ganguli_**

Ever since the A.K. Antony committee identified the

Congress

's Muslim ""appeasement"" tag as a major reason for its electoral reverses, the
133-year-old Grand Old Party (GOP) has been unable to formulate a clear-cut
policy on the country's largest minority community.

In a transparent attempt to shed the derogatory label given by its opponents,
Congress President

Rahul Gandhi

has engaged in what has been called ""temple hopping"" and has even expressed a
desire to go on a pilgrimage to Kailash Manasarovar, the ultimate pilgrimage
destination in Tibet for Hindus.

The chances, however, of these gestures persuading Hindus to turn away in
droves from the avowedly pro-Hindu

Bharatiya Janata Party

(BJP) and support the Congress are minimal. Instead, the latter's new Hindu
card may confuse the Muslims.

Rahul's father,

Rajiv Gandhi

, also made the mistake of following a muddled policy when he opposed the
Supreme Court's judgement in favour of a divorced Muslim woman, Shah Bano, at
the behest of Muslim fundamentalists and then ordered the opening of the locks
of the Babri Masjid to please their Hindu counterparts.

However, the fact that religious overtures do not matter if the nation is seen
to be advancing economically was proven in 2009 when the Congress increased
its tally of Lok Sabha seats at a time when India was experiencing the
fastest-ever reduction of poverty, according to Arvind Subramanian, the former
Chief Economic Adviser of the

Narendra Modi

government.

Yet, only five years later, the Congress suffered its worst ever defeat
largely because of the ""socialistic"" policies favoured by Sonia Gandhi
advocated by the crypto-communist members of her National Advisory Council at
the expense of economic reforms.

What these ups and downs show is that economy is the key. There is no need
either to display an overt devotion to Hinduism or hold a meeting with a
select group of Muslim intellectuals, as Rahul Gandhi has done, to find out
what their community wants.

It is another matter that at the moment, the Muslims want a sense of security,
which was pointed out by former Vice President Hamid Ansari. Their angst is
understandable at a time when a Union minister garlands a group charged with
killing a Muslim.

But, in the long run, the most palpable sense of safety is provided by a
buoyant economy as it fosters a feeling of wellness which few want to disrupt
through targeted violence.

The BJP's success in 2014 was the outcome of Modi's appropriation of the
economic reforms which the Manmohan Singh government had neglected in its
twilight years when, as former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said, the
government made the mistake of taking its foot off the accelerator of reforms.

It is patent enough that the BJP would not have fared so well in 2014 if large
sections of the Muslims had not voted for it. If they are now feeling uneasy,
as Ansari has said, the reasons are not only the sporadic acts of violence of
the saffron activists, but also that the reforms have not delivered to the
extent they were expected to do.

As the original initiator of the reforms, the Congress's focus should be on
ways to rev up the economy and not on photo-ops at temples and powwows with
Muslim notables. If the party can generate enough confidence about its ability
to do what it alleges the Modi government has failed to do, there will be no
need for any kind of religious overtures.

Along with the articulation of development-oriented ideas, the Congress will
have to be less apologetic about its pursuit of secularism. While Jawaharlal
Nehru's Fabian socialism can be discarded when it doesn't exist even in the
fatherland of the creed, his

secularism

has to be preserved and nurtured.

If the Congress earned the reputation of being a ""Muslim party"", as Sonia
Gandhi has said, it is because of the misapplication of the secular principles
as the Shah Bano fiasco showed, for the doctrine does not entail pandering to
the Muslim hardliners as was done in the mid-1980s but to the ordinary members
of the community.

Their value is immense not because they constitute 14.2 per cent of the
population, numbering 172.2 million, second only to Indonesia (209 million)
and ahead of Pakistan (167.4 million), but because of their contributions to
India's art, architecture, cuisine and culture. Moreover, their interest lies
in advancing in step with the rest of the country as M.S. Sathyu's iconic
film, ""Garam Hawa"", depicted in the 1970s.

The Congress, however, made the mistake of seeing the community through the
lenses of the bigoted and bearded maulvis (clerics) and abiding by their
prejudices. Hence, the ""Muslim party"" nomenclature because the BJP was quick
to capitalise on the GOP's lapses in judgement.

It is time for the Congress to clarify that secularism does not stand for
appeasement of minorities but ensuring that they have a place of honour in the
country.

**Aadhaar Data Cannot Be Hacked Even After Trying A Billion Times: Minister** 

 ______ 
Ravi Shankar Prasad said Aadhaar authorities conduct nearly 1 crore
authentications every second (File)

**Panaji: **

The biometric data of Aadhaar cannot be hacked even if someone tried a billion
times, Union Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said on
Sunday, while calling the data storage system ""completely safe and secure"".

""... the system contains my fingerprints and my iris scan, kept in a safe and
secure condition which cannot be broken into even with billion efforts,"" Mr
Prasad said at a public function organised in Panaji.

The minister said that Aadhaar authorities conduct nearly one crore
authentications every second.

""Do you know how many authentications we do every three seconds? Three crore.
Do you know how many bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar? 80 crore accounts.
And Aadhaar is your homegrown technology (at) one dollar each and completely
safe and secure with proper parliamentary approval.""

""(It is) so tough that even if I disclose information regarding a fingerprint
and iris scan to an unknown person, except in case of national security, I can
be prosecuted. That is the inclusive part we have done,"" Mr Prasad said,
lauding the Modi government for ""taking rapid steps in making India more
digital"".

""What is the digital profile of India? For a population of 130 crore, India is
home to 121 crore mobile phones, 450 million smartphones, 50 crore plus
Internet (connections) and 122 crore Aadhaar cards,"" Mr Prasad said.

Calling ''Digital India'' as a transformative programme designed to empower
the ordinary Indians with the power of technology, Mr Prasad said that India
looked to be a leader in digital revolution.

""We missed the industrial revolution, we missed the entrepreneurial
revolution, which happened in the world in the 60s, 70s, and 80s because of
licence-quota raj. We do not want to miss the digital revolution. We want to
become leaders. That is the philosophy of Digital India,"" he said.

Mr Prasad said that one of the key objectives of Digital India is to bridge
the gulf between ''digital haves'' and ''digital have nots'' and usher in
digital inclusion based on technology which is developmental, inclusive and
low cost.

__

""That is the transformative nature of Digital India, Skill India, Startup
India, Smart Cities. It is all technology-based programming designed to
empower ordinary Indians to reform, perform and transform,"" Mr Prasad said.

# Arun Jaitley: India needs a decisive leader like Modi, not a tragedy king
like Kumaraswamy

## Jaitley's remarks were directed towards the emotional outburst of Karnataka
CM HD Kumaraswamy, who on Sunday had equated the burden of carrying the weight
of a coalition government to 'swallowing poison' like Lord Shiva.

Senior Minister Arun Jaitley said that a fast-moving economy like India cannot
afford an indecisive coalition government. (File)

Senior Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday lashed out at the Congress-led
coalition government in Karnataka, stating that the objective of such
opportunistic alliances was only survival and not serving the nation. Hitting
out at HD Kumaraswamy for his emotional outburst on Sunday, Jaitley said India
required a decisive leader like Narendra Modi and not a tragedy king like
Karnataka chief minister.

Jaitley’s remarks come a day after a teary-eyed Kumaraswamy equated the burden
of carrying the weight of a coalition government to “swallowing poison” like
Lord Shiva. In a Facebook post, Jaitley said what the Congress had done in
Karnataka was a repeat of what it did to Chaudhary Charan Singh,
Chandrasekhar, H D Deve Gowda and I K Gujral. He also said the only agenda of
this opportunistic alliance was to ‘Keep Modi Out’.

Talking about Kumaraswamy, Jaitley said a coalition government with
ideological dissimilarity was not fit to lead a nation. “If such a coalition
is a cup of poison, why even dream of inflicting it on the nation? The leader
of the world’s fastest-growing economy cannot be a ‘Bechara’,” he said.
Jaitley contended that tackling terror could never be compromised with vote
bank politics in succumbing to the pressure of allies. “Then such a government
would be a liability and curse on the nation,” he said.

in Bengaluru on Saturday. (File)

The senior minister, who is recuperating after a renal surgery, further said,
“If the Prime Minister of such a coalition has to weep before the cameras with
an only wish of how to exit from office, it will be a scenario worse than the
policy paralysis of UPA II.”

Castigating Congress over its dynastic politics, Jaitley said the Grand Old
Party believed that one family could rule India. “If anybody else gets a
chance, he should be pushed to the desperation of throwing his hands up and
weeping publicly,” he mentioned in his post.

**READ | Kumaraswamy: Not happy, swallowing pain like Lord Shiva who drank poison**

Recalling an article written by him on May 26, Jaitley pointed towards the
frequently changing ideological positions of different political groups when
it came to forming alliances. In the article, he mentioned that parties like
TMC, DMK, TDP, BSP and the JD(S) had previously allied with BJP, claiming that
it was in larger national interest, and then did a volte-face in the name of
secularism.

Jaitley also took a dig at the Opposition’s idea of a federal front, calling
it a “failed idea”. Quoting instances from the past, he said, “It was
experimented under Charan Singh, Chandrasekhar and by the United Front
Government between 1996-98. Such a front with its contradictions, sooner or
later, loses its balance and equilibrium. Remembering 1996-98, as perhaps one
of the worst period of governance, the aspirational India which today occupies
the high table in the world shall never accept an idea which has repeatedly
failed.”

He further said, “Aspirational societies with vibrant democracies do not
invite anarchy. A strong nation and the requirements of good governance abhor
anarchy. The political agenda for the debate this year appropriately will be
Prime Minister “Modi versus an anarchist combination.”

**Pointing At Mamata Banerjee, PM Modi Says Bengal's Durga Puja In Danger** 

 ______ 
PM Modi attacked Mamata Banerjee's government, saying nothing works in Bengal
without syndicates.

**Kolkata: **

In Bengal today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the state's biggest
festival, the Durga Puja, to launch a sharp attack on Chief Minister Mamata
Banerjee. The Prime Minister is on a day's visit to the state to speak about
his government's initiative for farmers in terms of the recent rise in Minimum
Support Price for selected summer crops. But it also served as a platform to
launch a sharp attack on the Trinamool Congress government.  
  
As one of the few non-BJP, non-Congress states in the country, Bengal ranks
high on the wishlist of Amit Shah for next year's general elections. The BJP
chief has already handed a 22-plus seat target to the state cadre. Bengal has
42 parliamentary seats.  
  
In his 40-minute address in Midnapore today, PM Modi's sharpest attack was
reserved for what he called the ""appeasement politics"" of Mamata Banerjee,
saying even Durga Puja, the heartbeat of Bengal, was in danger because of it.
The reference was to the Chief Minister's last year's embargo on Durga
immersion ceremony in view of Ramzan processions, which had triggered
widespread anger in the state.  
  

__

The Prime Minister also accused the ruling party of running an extortionist
regime in the state. Nothing moves in Bengal without paying up money to
syndicates, he said. ""Whether it is to build schools or hospitals, you have to
pay syndicates"". He also took on the ruling party over the recently concluded
panchayat polls, saying ""I salute the brave people coming out to support the
BJP despite being afraid.""

""Things are worse in Bengal than during the Left rule,"" PM Modi said. ""But
while it took 34 years to oust the communists, the people of Bengal will not
have to wait very long for the next change.""

""The BJP leader's speech proved that they have no development agenda at all.
He came and gave a political bhashan. The net result is ZERO, ZERO, ZERO,""
read a press release signed by senior party leaders Derek O'Brien and Partha
Chatterjee.

Hitting back at the PM Modi's accusation of Trinamool Congress being a
""syndicate"", the party accused the BJP of being a ""syndicate that peddles
religious extremism"", for ""fanatics, lynching, torture and corruption"".

Accusing the BJP of bringing in people from neighbouring states Jharkhand,
Bihar and Odisha for the Prime Minister's meeting, the party brushed off his
pitch to farmers. According to a parliamentary report, in the first quarter of
2017, the number of farmer suicides in Maharashtra was 635, while the figure
for Bengal was zero, the party said.

""Hope the BJP leader has got his answer. These numbers tell the true story of
the farmers' situation in the country and their condition in Bengal,"" the
party said.

&gt;Basham demanded that the caste system be viewed in the context of  India's culture. ""If untouchability persists,"" he wrote, ""it is not due  to sinister political forces at work in New Delhi, but because the  majority of Indians, despite intense counter-propaganda, want it to  persist.""

&gt;The alacrity and ingenuity with which Calcutta pedestrians dodged the  new drop gates at road crossings as soon as they were installed matched  the resourcefulness of operators from Jayanti Dharma Teja to Nirav Modi  and Mehul Choksi for whom the self is supreme. Not that opportunism is  exclusively Indian. Devi Lal's famous ""If I don't promote my own sons,  whose sons should I promote - someone else's?"" is often cited as the  stereotypical exposition of kinship taking precedence over merit.

&gt;This is hardly the ""*Sabka saath, sabka vikas*"" vision that  excited the Trump administration. Nor can any Indian regard it as the  promised ""Achchhe Din"", no matter how encouraging the sensex figures  might seem. It warns of turbulence boiling under the surface gloss, of  violence, greed and cunning barely concealed by snappy slogans like  ""Digital India"" and ""Start up India, Stand up India"". Nirav Modi and  Choksi could not have exploited the Punjab National Bank if nationalized  banks had served the nation and not only those who rule the nation. My  modest experience of some State Bank of India branches in Calcutta made  it clear one needs access to the banking ombudsman to persuade it even  to reply to a complaint. Struggling to persuade the bank to correct my  long-dead mother's name which they had grotesquely misspelt in their  records, I wonder at the inducement (influence?) that must have inspired  the PNB's generous letters of undertaking. People don't dream of  objecting because the multitude in our hierarchical society takes it for  granted that unless you have the clout of an Ambani or an Adani, you  must put up with rudeness, callousness and carelessness from those in  authority.

&gt;Money looms larger than ever before in this world. Honesty and  dishonesty have come to be interpreted only in financial terms. When I  expressed doubts about the integrity of a new entrant into the saffron  circle, a friend of his solemnly assured me the man didn't take bribes.  There was no point trying to explain to him that pretence and posturing,  *suppressio veri* that is the equivalent of suggestio falsi, are  just as unethical. His understanding of ethics had been shaped at his  grandmother's knee listening to stirring legends of how gods and heroes  had pulled a fast one on their adversaries. Cleverness, the ability to  outsmart, is what succeeds.

&gt;Religion is too closely tied up with material welfare to yield to  reason. The relationship between devotees and temples has been described  as transactional. Those who give lavishly also entertain lavish  expectations from the deity. That goes for any form of giving, even of  salutation. The Presidency University vice-chancellor was being utterly  candid when she explained her startling public obeisance to Mamata  Banerjee by saying she does this version of the *pranam* to ""any  older person or anyone of status"", particularly mentioning the  chancellor and her PhD supervisor. Bosses have to be appeased. This is  another transactional relationship.",2018-07-16 21:13:06

Modi/BJP is not messing with constitution despite claims by Tharoor and Co. Further, Modi, Jaitley and Naidu basically promised not to change constitution in the parliment.

B) There are some BJP leaders such have Mahesh Girri who have taken first two points. Some BJP leaders are trying to attack this discrimination by getting into minority status for colleges which receive state funding such as AMU and JMU. I feel that is a bad strategy and there is a need to amend at least Article 15(5)

C) The first 2 are the result of 93rd amendment brought in 2006 by congress. Prior to that, the courts had ruled that there could be separate rules/autonomy/policies for aided and unaided - with the 93rd amendment, the real difference became whether you are minority or not. Asking a congressman as to why they have amended the constitution in the first place to bring about this change is valid

D) On the last point, BJP is only slightly better. The pace of temples coming under the govt has reduced but even BJP(at the least the top leadership is not bothered) is not against temples under govt control

312,"These are relevant questions as Tharoor is making claims of Hinduism and is a MP. As an MP, what is his stand on the above issues?

Just going to do copy paste of my earlier comment. All Tharoor is doing is FUD to get minority votes to consolidate against BJP.

# On Constitution and Congress:

The initial fear propounded by Tharoor was BJP would tear up the Constitution and write a new one. In this classification, the entire tearing up and writing new Constitution have gone out of the window and it is about a vague putting Minorites in subordinate position. It is vague enough that no one understands what changes are to be made in Constitution but will generate enough fear among minorities.

Given that BJP leadership in parliament has clearly stated that they will not change the Constitution, Tharoor needed to obfuscate by bringing about Pakistan, minorities etc.

**Congress has introduced the 93rd amendment which clearly discriminates against non-minorities whereas all discussion on BJP changes to Constitution are wildly speculative.**

# BJP leadership stand on Constitution

&gt;In his concluding remarks Prime Minister Narendra Modi categorically states that there will be no changes made to the constitution of India.

You talk about corruption, but what about the growth? How much has India grown since he came? I guess more than what we did in a decade of congress rule. People are tired of this shit.


I guess no one can be kept clean because politics in India is a hot mess. Go and have a look at states ruled by other parties, Did you have a look at Kolkata, Bihar or ever went to Andhra, where is the development, why aren't we stopping illegal immigrants, why is there still vote fraud at this scale, are you covering that in your so called press release, with ""cow dung""? (very professionally written BTW).


Talk about AAP, they even discredited indian army's ""surgical strike"" just because they can point a finger at the Prime Minister. DO you want him to be the prime minister? Or rahul gandhi, who..... well.... open youtube and watch.


At this point india is so blown out and sucked dry by politicians that even if Modi is corrupt, it doesn't matter, because we will still make 90% more progress than we ever did under other parties. Doesn't matter if his friends get rich, it's still great for India. Ofcourse, I don't think Modi is corrupt, I guess he is all for power, his only goal that I have noticed is getting famous and powerful, nothing is wrong with that. And to stay powerful and in the game they are doing campaigns.


Jio? Yeah, he supported Jio, it was for the digital India,.. How much do you remember paying for the internet before that?
I used to pay Rs.250 for a 2 GB 3G pack to Airtel before Jio launched, and suddenly Airtel gives 30GB 4G data for Rs.250 with FREE CALLS..... Woow.
Did iron became cheap, or do they have plastic satellites now? No, they were selling it to us for more than 95% profit and after Jio came, they finally had a competition and had to lower their prices and provide calls and internet for a fair price, that too after 10+ years of robbing Indians. Airtel even sued Jio for some useless shit at that time, but hey, guess who won.

Is it bad that Modi supported this and maybe helped make it happen?



I don't like Amit Shah's and several other politicians, but I guess Modi was the much needed leader that India has waited to get for a long time. If he loses the election, India will go to the drain again.

**BSP pitches for ‘dabang’ Mayawati, says Rahul can’t be PM as his mother is a foreigner | india news**

The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Monday projected its president Mayawati as
the prime ministerial candidate for next year’s general election, and said
that Congress president Rahul Gandhi could not aspire to the post due to “his
mother’s foreign origin”.

Addressing the first workers’ conference to discuss the party’s strategy for
the Lok Sabha election, BSP national co-ordinators Vir Singh and Jai Prakash
Singh said it was “high time that Mayawati became the prime minister of the
country”, and that she was the only one who could take on Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.

“After playing a pivotal role in making HD Kumaraswamy the chief minister of
Karnataka, Mayawati has emerged as a powerful politician. She is the only
‘dabang’ (fearless) leader who can stop the winning chariot of Narendra Modi
and Amit Shah in the electoral battle,” Jai Prakash Singh said.

“She is not only a towering Dalit leader but also has the support of all the
communities. Time has come when she should be made the PM after the 2019 Lok
Sabha election,” he added.

On Gandhi, who is widely believed to be the Congress’s PM face, Singh added:
“Rahul looks more like his mother than his father. And his mother is a
foreigner, thus he can never be PM”.

Congress representatives refused to react to the comment.

Singh said the BSP chief had more credentials than Congress president Rahul
Gandhi to become prime minister. “Mayawati is a grass roots leader who has
served as Uttar Pradesh chief minister four times,” he said.

“During the oath-taking ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy, the leaders of opposition
parties rallied behind Mayawati on the dais. This clearly indicates that she
is playing a pivotal role in anti-Modi alliance,” said BSP state unit
president RS Kushwaha.

Reacting to the BSP leaders’ comments, BJP Rajya Sabha member and head of
party’s media department, Anil Baluni said: “Anyone can dream of becoming PM
even if they do not have a single seat in Lok Sabha. A leader with 44 seats
like Rahul Gandhi is dreaming of becoming the PM and a leader like Mayawati
with no seat is also dreaming of becoming the PM.”

320,"Some numbers from the story [**Dear PM Modi, GDP Is Gross Economic Jumla For Campaign 2019**, Raghav Bahl, Bloomberg Quint, July-2018](https://www.bloombergquint.com/opinion/2018/06/30/dear-pm-modi-gdp-is-gross-economic-jumla-for-campaign-2019):

***

&gt; ... **Modi cherry picked all the good stuff, but plenty of troublesome facts were left unsaid**:

&gt; * Bad loans of Rs 10.3 lakh cr (11.6 percent) are projected to touch a crippling 12.2 percent by March 2019. While 701 cases have been submitted for bankruptcy resolution, only 176 have been resolved.

&gt; * Credit to large corporates grew at a mere 1 percent, year on year; so industrial growth recession continues, despite the 7.4 percent GDP growth.

&gt; * Interest rates are reaching for the stratosphere, with the 10-year treasury breaching 8 percent, and AAA-rated borrowers picking up loans at north of 8.5 percent. These are not propitious for a pick-up in private investment, which is a condition precedent for sustained economic growth.

&gt; * The current account deficit, which had nearly moved to a surplus, is again blinking red at 2.5 percent. The rupee is at a historical low, shooting past Rs 69 to the U.S. dollar. Foreigners have pulled out a record $ 7 billion dollars just in the current calendar year from the debt/equity markets.

&gt; * The government has done a ‘phantom disinvestment’ by forcing ONGC to pay Rs 35,000 crore for buying HPCL, both dominant public sector companies. So the cash has moved from one government pocket to another, without any genuine inflow. A similarly specious plan is being hatched for re-capitalising IDBI Bank’s battered balance sheet, with LIC picking up the tab. Air India’s sale proved an embarrassing cropper, without a single bidder.

&gt; ##This is voodoo, band-aid economics...",2018-07-17 09:48:45
321,"&gt;Many prizes, such as the Nobel, can't be conferred posthumously, not even on the very recently dead. However, India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, has often been awarded to dead people to recognize distinction that might have been unjustly overlooked in the past. The classic omission, of course, was Dr Ambedkar, ignored by every political dispensation (principally the Congress system but also the Janata coalition) till 1990 when V.P. Singh's short-lived government tried to make amends.

&gt;It isn't clear that this afterthought was appropriate. It was arguably better that Ambedkar remained sans Ratna in the company of Tagore, Gandhi and Periyar, than honoured and consigned to the company of Gulzarilal Nanda, Vinoba Bhave, Purushottam Das Tandon, Rajiv Gandhi, V.V. Giri and Sachin Tendulkar. India giving Ambedkar the Bharat Ratna is like France giving Voltaire the Légion d'honneur; a republic shouldn't fold members of its pantheon into its honours system unless it wants to seem presumptuous and absurd.

&gt;But at least there is a case to be made for posthumous honours. Recent reports in India, though, have forced its citizens to reckon with another sort of disembodied distinction. Having honoured the deeds of the dead, the Indian State has decided to formally acknowledge the achievements of the unborn.

&gt;This is of a piece with Narendra Modi's pioneering style where he rushes in where no man has been before. He renamed Christmas the first time it came around on his watch. Then he showed us his special parlour trick on prime time: how to make everyone's money disappear. For his new act, his government has decided to give educational 'institutions of eminence' freedom to do pretty much what they want.

&gt;This in itself isn't a novel policy; the privatization of education, the unmanacling of universities from the dead hand of the State, has been a staple of liberalizing reformers for some years now. Kapil Sibal, the worst education minister in the history of the republic, nearly destroyed Delhi University in his bid to re-make public universities in the blurry image of American liberal arts education. It isn't clear whether this mad determination to fix a university system that wasn't broken was a deliberate bid to destroy Delhi University or just a bungled experiment, but the net result was a loss of reputation for India's best public university at the very moment when expensive private universities were selling themselves to rich parents as boutique alternatives to it.

&gt;The UPA's defunding of higher education has been accelerated by the NDA; on this, if nothing else, these political fronts are agreed. By dismantling the University Grants Commission, higher education's regulatory body, and 'freeing' selected colleges and universities from its jurisdiction, the present government hopes to create a brave new ecology where a few hundred hothouse flowers bloom outside the government's regulatory framework.

&gt;To indicate that the State is still concerned about standards, the Modi government has linked educational independence to the 'eminence' of an institution. To certify an institution as eminent is a way of signaling that this unprecedented freedom is being conferred on the tried-and-tested and true: universities and colleges that have track records as centres of excellence and can, therefore, be trusted to be responsible captains of their own fate.

&gt;The integrity of this process can be measured by the fact that one of these six eminent institutions doesn't have a track record on which it can be judged. The Jio Institute has no faculty, no student body, no campus, no actual courses; this is because it doesn't exist outside its sponsor's head. It is eminent because Mukesh Ambani says it will be and the government of India agrees with his chequebook. Here eminence is not a function of past performance, it is a function of potential where potential is equal to money.

&gt;Shashi Tharoor recently claimed to have coined the word 'prepone'. The merit of that claim is an argument for another day but Tharoor is right about the usefulness of the word. The orthodox antonyms for postpone, 'brought forward' or 'advanced', are ponderous and sound alien to the desi ear. In this spirit, what should the appropriate Indian antonym for posthumous recognition be? If a posthumous prize is an extreme form of after-the-fact recognition, what term should we use for before-the-fact eminence?

&gt;Going by the logic of posthumous recognition, the first term that suggests itself for the Jio Institute's very particular distinction is 'prenatal'. If posthumous applies to honours conferred after the death of a distinguished person, prenatal properly describes honours granted before the birth of an eminent person or institution. Thus, a newspaper reporting on the choice of the Jio Institute (still a twinkle in a tycoon's eye) might simply write 'The Jio Institute has been prenatally honoured for its eminence.""

&gt;But amusing as the term is, it doesn't actually fit Jio's case. A prenatal state suggests an unborn child. In its gynaecological meaning, prenatal refers to the period of pregnancy. Prenatal eminence in the business of higher education might be reasonably used to describe an evolving campus with excellent infrastructure, an ambitious faculty recruitment programme and an innovative course structure that hasn't yet opened its doors for the actual business of teaching and learning and research. Ambani's institute isn't just unborn, it just isn't. It exists as an intention in the way that someone might intend to have a child without actually being pregnant. Hailing the eminence of the Jio Institute is like pinning a medal on an unfertilized egg or unmated spermatozoon. To choose the Jio Institute for its eminence in its current state is, therefore, to confer on it an ovular (or seminal) distinction.

&gt;To honour an egg because it's gilded by Croesus is, of course, the Adani-Ambani syndrome in action, an instance of this government's willingness to pander to plutocrats. Ambani is the tip of the iceberg; the government is also bending over backwards to help Vedanta's fantasy university achieve seminal eminence. But to limit our criticism to the State is to obscure a larger corruption. It isn't the government's propensity to bend the knee to money that is the problem, it is our willingness to follow suit.

&gt;When this government announced its 'Adopt a Heritage' scheme whereby corporations with no experience in conservation or tourism were to be given charge of India's defining monuments, several commentators and many citizens supported the initiative because they were ideologically committed to the idea that successful businessmen were uniquely equipped to set India right regardless of experience or expertise. (Predictably, the one billionaire who has actually committed a large part of his time and fortune to education and his university, the Azim Premji University, figures nowhere in this specious conversation about eminence.)

&gt;The eager suspension of disbelief in the presence of money, this willing surrender to the idea that India's deliverance in everything from tourism to education will come from protean entrepreneurs, these are forms of magical thinking that debase our policy conversations. The government's grovelling attribution of eminence to a paper institution dreamt up by a billionaire is the absurd but logical end-point of this slavishness.",2018-07-17 09:54:07

**30,000 Pakistanis granted Long Term Visas, allows them to buy property, get PAN, Aadhaar** 

 ______ 
By:

PTI

| New Delhi |

Published: July 16, 2018 8:45:04 pm

A total of 14,726 Pakistani citizens were given LTVs between 2011 and 2014.
(File)

Nearly 30,000 Pakistani nationals, mostly Hindus, have been granted Long Time
Visas (LTVs) since 2011, making them eligible to obtain PAN and Aadhaar cards
as well as buy property, Home Ministry officials said. In 2018, till today,
altogether 6,092 Pakistani nationals have been given LTVs in line with the
Modi government’s policy to help minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Bangladesh who come to India after facing alleged persecution in their home
country.

A total of 14,726 Pakistani citizens were given LTVs between 2011 and 2014
after they submitted applications in papers (offline), a Home Ministry
official said. Since 2015, when the process of granting LTVs were made online,
2,142 Pakistani nationals were given LTVs in 2015, as many as 2,298 in 2016
and 4,712 in 2017.

Under the latest policy of the central government, those belonging to minority
communities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, namely — Hindus, Sikhs,
Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians — staying in India on Long Term Visas,
are allowed to purchase a small dwelling unit sufficient to serve the needs of
a family for self-use and suitable accommodation for carrying out self-
employment, another official said.

However, they are barred from buying immovable property in and around
restricted or protected areas, including cantonment regions. Such communities
are also allowed to obtain PAN cards, Aadhaar numbers and driving licences,
take up self-employment or do business, and are allowed free movement within
the state of their stay and transfer of Long Term Visa papers from one state
to another. An additional 1,500 applications from Pakistani nationals for LTVs
are under considerations of the Home Ministry, the official said.

At least 90 people were injured when a makeshift tent collapsed at the venue
of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in West Bengal’s Midnapore town on
Monday.

According to eyewitnesses, some people had climbed on the iron rods holding up
the marquee, causing the structure to collapse. The injured were admitted to
Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, BJP leaders said.

Medical superintendent Tanmay Kumar Panja said 90 people were brought to the
hospital after the incident. Fourteen were discharged after first-aid, he
said. “As of now, 76 people, including 20 women, are undergoing treatment at
the hospital,” Panja added.

After addressing the rally, the Prime Minister, accompanied by state BJP chief
Dilip Ghosh, went to the hospital and spoke to some of the injured.

Asked about the incident, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said the poles of
the tent fell as the ground was wet after rain. Also, many people climbed atop
the tent, he said. Sinha said police and local security personnel should not
have allowed supporters to climb atop the tent.

The Centre has sought a report from the state government on the tent collapse
incident.

Sources said the venue for the rally could hold around 70,000 people, but on
Monday, the crowd had exceeded its capacity. “It happened all of a sudden. As
the structure collapsed, I was hit by a rod and fell on the ground. People ran
over me and I lost consciousness,” Swarno Mahato, 55, told The Indian Express.
Now in hospital, Mahato said she had come with other women of her village to
hear the Prime Minister speak. “We never expected this to happen. Since there
were no ambulances on the ground, we requested someone to take my mother-in-
law to the hospital on a bike,” said Sumitra, Mahato’s daughter-in-law.

issued by the party.

“Your party is a syndicate of corruption…BJP leaders should not play with
fire. Try as you may to harass us with your agencies, we will not bow down to
any syndicate,” it went on to say.

Addressing a rally in Midnapore Town Monday, the prime minister had attacked
the ruling TMC, accusing it of running “syndicates” in every sector. —_ENS_

**""Stand With Last Person In Line"": Rahul Gandhi Amid Row Over Muslim Remark** 

 ______ 
Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who is in the middle of a controversy over
allegations that he called Congress a ""Muslim party"", today hit back at the
BJP with a tweet that appeared to encapsulate his party's ideology.

""I stand with the last person in the line. The exploited, marginalised and the
persecuted. Their religion, caste or beliefs matter little to me. I seek out
those in pain and embrace them. I erase hatred and fear. I love all living
beings. I am the Congress,"" the 47-year-old chief of the Congress tweeted.

The alleged remarks that created the row were reported by one Urdu newspaper.
But the matter was swiftly zeroed in by the BJP, with first defence minister
Nirmala Sitharaman, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi, targeting the Congress
chief.

""I read in the newspapers that naamdaar (entitled) said the Congress is a
party of the Muslims. I am not surprised... When the previous prime minister
was in charge, he said openly that the first use of natural resources should
be with Muslims,"" PM Modi said at a public meeting in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh.

__

Most of the Muslim intellectuals at the meeting with Rahul Gandhi have denied
the comments attributed to him.

**Arun Jaitley: India needs a decisive leader like Modi, not a tragedy king like Kumaraswamy** 

 ______ 
By:

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Updated: July 16, 2018 7:25:12 pm

Senior Minister Arun Jaitley said that a fast-moving economy like India cannot
afford an indecisive coalition government. (File)

Senior Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday lashed out at the Congress-led
coalition government in Karnataka, stating that the objective of such
opportunistic alliances was only survival and not serving the nation. Hitting
out at HD Kumaraswamy for his emotional outburst on Sunday, Jaitley said India
required a decisive leader like Narendra Modi and not a tragedy king like
Karnataka chief minister.

Jaitley’s remarks come a day after a teary-eyed Kumaraswamy equated the burden
of carrying the weight of a coalition government to “swallowing poison” like
Lord Shiva. In a Facebook post, Jaitley said what the Congress had done in
Karnataka was a repeat of what it did to Chaudhary Charan Singh,
Chandrasekhar, H D Deve Gowda and I K Gujral. He also said the only agenda of
this opportunistic alliance was to ‘Keep Modi Out’.

Talking about Kumaraswamy, Jaitley said a coalition government with
ideological dissimilarity was not fit to lead a nation. “If such a coalition
is a cup of poison, why even dream of inflicting it on the nation? The leader
of the world’s fastest-growing economy cannot be a ‘Bechara’,” he said.
Jaitley contended that tackling terror could never be compromised with vote
bank politics in succumbing to the pressure of allies. “Then such a government
would be a liability and curse on the nation,” he said.

in Bengaluru on Saturday. (File)

The senior minister, who is recuperating after a renal surgery, further said,
“If the Prime Minister of such a coalition has to weep before the cameras with
an only wish of how to exit from office, it will be a scenario worse than the
policy paralysis of UPA II.”

Castigating Congress over its dynastic politics, Jaitley said the Grand Old
Party believed that one family could rule India. “If anybody else gets a
chance, he should be pushed to the desperation of throwing his hands up and
weeping publicly,” he mentioned in his post.

**READ | Kumaraswamy: Not happy, swallowing pain like Lord Shiva who drank poison**

Recalling an article written by him on May 26, Jaitley pointed towards the
frequently changing ideological positions of different political groups when
it came to forming alliances. In the article, he mentioned that parties like
TMC, DMK, TDP, BSP and the JD(S) had previously allied with BJP, claiming that
it was in larger national interest, and then did a volte-face in the name of
secularism.

Jaitley also took a dig at the Opposition’s idea of a federal front, calling
it a “failed idea”. Quoting instances from the past, he said, “It was
experimented under Charan Singh, Chandrasekhar and by the United Front
Government between 1996-98. Such a front with its contradictions, sooner or
later, loses its balance and equilibrium. Remembering 1996-98, as perhaps one
of the worst period of governance, the aspirational India which today occupies
the high table in the world shall never accept an idea which has repeatedly
failed.”

He further said, “Aspirational societies with vibrant democracies do not
invite anarchy. A strong nation and the requirements of good governance abhor
anarchy. The political agenda for the debate this year appropriately will be
Prime Minister “Modi versus an anarchist combination.”

**‘Rahul Gandhi can’t be Prime Minister’: BSP disses Congress president, pitches for ‘Dabang’ Mayawati as next PM** 

 ______ 
The message for the Congress came during the first workers’ conference to
chalk out the party’s strategy for the upcoming Lok Sabha election in 2019.

The united opposition suffered its first major blow as leaders of the Bahujan
Samaj Party told the Congress that its president Rahul Gandhi cannot be the
Prime Minister if an anti-Modi alliance comes to power. Articulating the
longstanding ambitions of its party supremo, the party said that nobody other
than Mayawati has the mettle to stop the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah victory roll
and that the Congress president should give up aspirations for the PM’s post
due to his mother Sonia Gandhi’s foreign origins.

The message for the Congress came during the first workers’ conference to
chalk out the party’s strategy for the upcoming Lok Sabha election in 2019.
Addressing the conference, BSP national co-ordinators Vir Singh and Jai
Prakash Singh said it was “high time that Mayawati became the prime minister
of the country”, and that she was the only one who could take on Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, reported Hindustan Times.

Asserting that Mayawati had emerged as a powerful politician after playing a
key role in making HD Kumaraswamy the chief minister of Karnataka, Jai Prakash
Singh said that “Mayawati is the only ‘dabang’ leader” who can stop the Modi-
Shah’s winning juggernaut.

“She is not only a towering Dalit leader but also has the support of all the
communities. Time has come when she should be made the PM after the 2019 Lok
Sabha election,” he said.

The leader wasn’t sparing to Congress president Rahul Gandhi who has voiced
his willingness to take on the role of the Prime Minister if his party emerges
as the single largest party in the general elections. Singh said Rahul looks
more like his mother than his father. “And his mother is a foreigner, thus he
can never be PM.”

The remarks come less than two months after a rare display of bonhomie between
UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and former UP Chief Minister Mayawati at the
swearing-in ceremony of Kumaraswamy in Bengaluru. Crucially, the comments
castigating the apparent PM face of the Congress could also prove a setback to
alliance talks for the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections scheduled for later
this year.

While neither the Congress nor Mayawati have commented on the remarks by the
BSP leader, the assertion of Mayawati’s PM bid should worry the Congress which
is trying to stitch together an umbrella alliance to dethrone Modi. Karnataka
was the first success it tasted on this model but the fissures have already
begun to show.

Kumaraswamy has stated on more than one occasion that his party, the JD(S), is
the younger alliance partner and is at the mercy of the coalition. The tension
between the two ruling alliance partners was also visible in the run-up to the
state budget, which Congress’ Siddaramaiah tried to stall. Just two days ago,
Kumaraswamy shed tears before cameras to drive home the point that he was
under pressure from the Congress on several fronts.

Going forward, this could be just one of the many challenges that the Congress
will have to contend with as it enters polls in several state assemblies and
the Lok Sabha.

**Rahul Gandhi's ""I Am Congress"" Reply To Row Over ""Muslim Party"" Remarks** 

 ______ 
Despite the Congress denial, the BJP taunted Rahul Gandhi.

**New Delhi: **

Rahul Gandhi, targeted by the BJP that accuses him of calling the Congress a
""Muslim party"", broke his silence on the controversy today by posting a tweet
with the punchline, ""I love all living beings. I am the Congress.""

The Congress has repeatedly denied that their president ever made the remarks
at a meeting with Muslim intellectuals, as reported by the Urdu newspaper
""Daily Inquilaab"". The comment was seized by the BJP; first Defence Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman raised it last week and then Prime Minister Narendra Modi
referred to the statement at a rally on Saturday.

Today, the 47-year-old Congress chief, who took charge of the party last
December, tweeted:

&gt; I stand with the last person in the line. The exploited, marginalised and
the persecuted. Their religion, caste or beliefs matter little to me.  
&gt;  
&gt; I seek out those in pain and embrace them. I erase hatred and fear.  
&gt;  
&gt; I love all living beings.  
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;

&gt; __

&gt;

&gt; I am the Congress.— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) July 17, 2018

Over the last week, the BJP and the Congress had been sniping at each other
over the reported remarks of Mr Gandhi. While the BJP called the Congress the
""worst communal party"", the Congress hit back with a page from history.
Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said the BJP is the new version of the East
India Company since it has also followed the divide and rule policy.

On Saturday, at a public meeting in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister
Narendra Modi said, ""I read in the newspapers that naamdaar (entitled) said
the Congress is a party of the Muslims. I am not surprised... When the
previous prime minister was in charge, he said openly that the first use of
natural resources should be with Muslims"".

Today, after Mr Gandhi's tweet, BJP leader Sambit Patra said, ""Rahul, You may
be standing in line with people at the end, but the people are not standing
with you. They know the Congress 'family rule' did not do anything for them"".

Most of the Muslim intellectuals at the meeting with Rahul Gandhi have denied
the comments attributed to him by the Urdu daily Inquilaab.

Inquilaab reporter Mumtaz Alam Rizwi said he stood by his report, but Mr
Gandhi's comments were nuanced. ""I never used the term Muslim party. Rahul
Gandhi said Congress is a party of Muslims. He said 'haan, (yes), because
Muslims are weakened, they have become another version of Dalits in the
country',"" said Mr Rizwi.

On Sunday, the ""Inquilab"" published another report claiming its version has
been corroborated by the Congress minority cell chief, who strongly denied it.

**India's banking revolution has left its villagers behind** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A shortage of bank branches and ATMs across India’s hinterland is
holding back Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s

financial inclusion

efforts and risks angering rural voters ahead of elections next year.

After taking office in 2014, Modi set an ambitious target to open a bank
account for every household to ensure welfare funds flow directly to India’s
poor, while improving access to credit and insurance programs. He pushed
policies that helped bring 31 crore people into the formal banking system in
just four years, according to the

World Bank

. But many of India’s villages still lack bank branches or ATMs to help
service these new customers, while the pace of building new financial
infrastructure has actually slowed.

Because Modi’s government effectively forced poor citizens into the banking
system by linking some welfare benefits to bank accounts, villagers have ended
up stuck in long queues and struggling with ATMs that often run out of cash or
break down. With an election due next year, the mismatch between the
government’s policies and the rural banking system is generating frustration
among a key slice of India’s electorate.

""In rural areas, we have found a serious and debilitating shortage of banking
infrastructure,"" said associate professor Reetika Khera of the Indian
Institute of Management (IIM) in Ahmedabad, who has conducted research in
India’s villages. ""A very large number of poor laborers and social security
pensioners are affected by these issues on the ground, so it won’t be
surprising if people are angry.""

A spokesman for the PMO did not return a call seeking comment.

Finance ministry spokesman D S Malik said the government has taken steps to
ensure Modi’s financial inclusion policies are enacted, including empowering
individuals such as teachers and shopkeepers to provide some banking services
as well as improving rural banking infrastructure.

**‘TAKE AWAY MY MONEY’**

While India gained about 25,000 bank branches and 45,000 ATMs in the four
years to March 2018, growth has not kept up with a surge in new customers.

India’s banking system ""lags in terms of physical infrastructure and has
failed to reach the poor,"" said a 2017 study from EY and the Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, which found 19 percent of the
population still lacks access to the formal credit system.

The experience of villagers in Jogaliya in Rajasthan, India’s largest state by
area, is typical. The village of about 5,500 people has no bank branch or

ATM

, and the closest one is 15 kilometers away. That’s a bus ride costing Rs 60
that would have been unnecessary before the government made it mandatory to
have bank accounts to get old-age pensions and other welfare payments.

""They don’t increase facilities, but they take away my money,"" said Rajuram
Jat, 32, of Jogaliya, who complained in late May about endless text messages
and charges from his bank.

He said he wouldn’t vote for Modi in 2019.

**DEMONETISATION**

The banking system struggled to keep up after demonetisation while some gains
proved temporary. Nearly half of Indian bank accounts were inactive in 2017,
meaning they weren’t used at all in the previous 12 months -- the highest
share in the world -- according to a World Bank report.

With financial and digital literacy already low, cash shortages and ""issues
with direct benefit transfers (DBT) further dent public faith in electronic
payments and reinforce the demand for physical currency,"" said Saksham Khosla,
a research analyst at Carnegie India.

The displeasure is not limited to bank customers: Roughly 1 million bank
employees went on strike in May demanding higher salaries. It hasn’t helped
that Modi began a bank bailout around the time public sector lenders were
engulfed by a wave of corruption allegations.

“Banking infrastructure will always look inadequate to us because of our huge
population and the difficulties in accessing cash,” said Sumita Kale, an
economist at Indicus Centre for Financial Inclusion. “Still, as so many people
come into the banking system for the first time, there has to be a better
monitoring and supervision framework.”

Also , this entire modis operandi of blaming everything on past governments only highlights present incompetence. Yatha raja tatha praja.. you are just following his lead.


For the record, for all the corruption allegations thrown at UPA, nothing has stuck. That has resulted not in introspection by the right wing ,but in even more crazed muck slinging that grows desperate as more and more comes out about the present govt s acheivements..

But all this is immaterial. Nirmala Seetharaman has already shown the way and blamed the Congress for all future communal riots , despite the fact that it's her govt that in power in the center and states.

All Indian parties do the same blaming others, and yes they are doing what suits them to get more votes and to shift responsibilities. Narendra Modi or his cabinet minister they will all blabber the same thing.

As for corruption from congress, CWG cases are still going on and Coal gate scams are advancing , yes the main culprits will never be convicted whether it's questionable rise in Son of Amit Shah. At the end of the day governments will change and while all the parties fight in Parliament they will drink tea together in canteen outside.
From bofors to Kargil Coffin Scam ( during Vajpayee goverment ) to Coalgate. We all know how justice system works, don't we ? Did UPA in 10 years jailed key ministers of NDA , no they didn't.

FYI just because I say something against congress doesn't make me right wing and just because BJP ministers got clean chit in 2002 riots and congress leaders in 1984 doesn't make them saints.

We will keep fighting , right-wing or left-wing while it's all in text-book ultimately they are all capitalistic and friends.
It's not what I believe, but hard facts UPA have surmounted such humongous NPA, some which are realised and some which aren't yet, and if those loans do convert to NPA nobody knows what will happen. 
I don't give a shit about Modi , but it's strange that you are so inclined with UPA . You have whitewashed every single scam, so according to you Madhu Koda ( involved in 2002 riots ) also innocent ? I know personally what went down in 2002 in Gujarat when I was there in Rajkot,  and Narendra Modi should've resigned then only.

**Farmers In Karnataka Are Using Cutouts Of PM Modi, Amit Shah As Scarecrows** 

 ______ 
In the recently concluded state assembly election, BJP swept in all the five
assembly constituency of the district. Thanks to the whirlwind campaign
carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party's national president
Amit Shah.

Both of them had addressed massive rallies in the district which was attended
by a huge crowd. The party local leaders too carried out the aggressive booth
level campaign by using the cutouts of the leaders including Prime Minister,
party national president and party CM candidate BS Yeddyurappa. But two months
later same cutouts are now used as scarecrows by many farmers in Lakkavalli
""hobli"" of the Tarikere taluk.

According to the villagers of this region, this year due to good monsoon
rainfall, sowing is completed in most part of the ""hobli"" and few farmers are
using the old cutouts of the national leaders as the scarecrow. ""It is not
restricted to any particular party. Party leaders had kept the cutouts to seek
votes in the villages and semi urban areas. Now the farmers are using the same
in their fields,"" said Rajesh Matapati, a resident of Tarikere and an agro-
equipment supplier.

""Many were using the buntings, wooden sticks used for the cutouts for the
various purposes,"" he added.

When contacted, T N Shivakiran, president, Lakkavalli grama panchayat, said
that he hasn't seen any cutouts used as the scarecrow.

**Chikkamagaluru: Election over, farmers now use Modi, Shah cutouts as scarecrows** 

 ______ 
CHIKKAMAGALURU: In the recently concluded state assembly election, BJP swept
in all the five assembly constituency of the district. Thanks to the whirlwind
campaign carried out by Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

and party's national president

Amit Shah

.

Both of them had addressed massive rallies in the district which was attended
by a huge crowd. The party local leaders too carried out the aggressive booth
level campaign by using the cutouts of the leaders including Prime Minister,
party national president and party CM candidate BS

Yeddyurappa

. But two months later same cutouts are now used as scarecrows by many farmers
in Lakkavalli ""hobli"" of the Tarikere taluk.

According to the villagers of this region, this year due to good monsoon
rainfall, sowing is completed in most part of the ""hobli"" and few farmers are
using the old cutouts of the national leaders as the scarecrow. ""It is not
restricted to any particular party. Party leaders had kept the cutouts to seek
votes in the villages and semi urban areas. Now the farmers are using the same
in their fields,"" said Rajesh Matapati, a resident of Tarikere and an agro-
equipment supplier.

""Many were using the buntings, wooden sticks used for the cutouts for the
various purposes,"" he added.

When contacted, T N Shivakiran, president, Lakkavalli grama panchayat, said
that he hasn't seen any cutouts used as the scarecrow.

**BJP has fulfilled PM Modi’s campaign promise of giving Rs 15 lakh: Rajasthan party chief** 

 ______ 
The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) new president in Rajasthan Madanlal Saini
said in an interview that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign promise of
transferring Rs 15 lakh to the people had been indirectly fulfilled.

Prime Minister Modi made the promise of bringing black money stashed away
abroad by Indians back to India and enrich every Indian when he was still
candidate Modi; in 2015, several months after the BJP came to power, party
president Amit Shah said Modi’s promise was idiomatic and said everyone knew
that black money, if retrieved, would anyway not go into the accounts of
ordinary Indians.

Saini had a different spin on that. “Nobody gives cash, but arrangements have
been made so that the poor have got benefits to the tune of Rs 15 lakh,” he
explained, adding for effect that the government couldn’t be expected to “give
Rs 15 lakh to Ambani”, a reference to Mukesh Ambani, who was recently named
the richest man in Asia.

Saini enumerated the benefits announced by the Central and state government
schemes to the poor and underprivileged to buttress his claim. “If you combine
all the benefits, the poor have got Rs 15 lakh,” he said.

Commenting on reports of suicides by farmers in the Hadauti region, Saini said
this was unlikely. “I am a farmer myself. We in Shekhawati have to pull out
water from a depth of 500 feet and many times are not able to sow the seeds.
Farmers of Rajasthan are used to struggle and hard work. Some farmer might
have died due to natural causes.”

Rajasthan, like many other states, is in the midst of an agrarian crisis
caused largely by market conditions (falling prices for farm output) and the
government announced a loan waiver last year to address the problem.

However, that doesn’t seem to have been enough, and experts say that farm
distress could be one variable affecting the outcome of assembly elections due
in the state by the end of the year.

Saini also defended the BJP’s election promise in 2013 of creating 1.5 million
jobs in Rajasthan. At the time, reports said these were government jobs. Saini
clarified the BJP had never meant government jobs. “We have given 2-3 lakh
government jobs (over four years). Then, there have been other employment
opportunities… if you do the total, we have given Rs 15 lakh jobs.”

Saini also addressed perceptions that chief minister Vasundhara Raje was
inaccessible.

One has to appreciate the fact that the CM is a woman and can’t meet people
all the time, he explained. “You and I can meet if you are shaving or brushing
your teeth. Sometime I meet people while washing clothes, but a woman can’t do
that.” He added that the CM had been visiting constituencies and meeting
people and party workers.

There have been reports that the BJP could look at performance and winnability
before selecting candidates for elections, with the possibility that sitting
legislators may sometimes not get a ticket. Saini confirmed this. “Getting a
ticket is not a right. It is party’s decision based on the decision of the
parliamentary board. We have to see the social equation and look at the work
done by a particular MLA and it also depends on the feedback received from the
people.”

**Tears don't reflect helplessness, never said Congress troubling me: HD Kumaraswamy** 

 ______ 
After his emotional speech at a JDS event fuelled speculation about strain in
ties with ally

Congress

,

Karnataka

Chief Minister H D

Kumaraswamy

today said he had shed tears not out of ""helplessness"" and asserted that he
did not speak anything against the Congress.

Kumaraswamy said there was nothing wrong in being emotional at a party event
which was like a ""family function"" for him and accused the media of hyping the
issue. The JDS leader said nowhere during his speech had he said that Congress
or its leaders were troubling him.

I'm an emotional person, but it is not my helplessness. Did I shed tears at a
government programme? As

chief minister

I have worked towards implementing programmes strongly,"" he said.

""I was speaking at my family programme. I have shared my pain with family
members. I have not criticised Congress leaders. While talking emotionally, it
is natural that tears flow. More than a CM, I am an ordinary person with
emotions,"" he told reporters here.

The chief minister is in Delhi till Thursday morning, during which he will be
meeting several Union ministers and will also be chairing a meeting of MPs
from Karnataka on issues like Cauvery river water to be raised during
Parliament session.

""I spoke for an hour on that day. Nowhere I talked anything about the Congress
creating problems. I have told media friends that despite difficulty I have
taken the strong step of loan waiver and have implemented programmes, but
somewhere I'm not getting encouragement for my good work.

""While speaking about it I got emotional as I felt that people still don't
have faith in me (that I will deliver), and not because I was unable to bear
any problem created by any party,"" he said.

He said his ""media friends"" made it a big issue and created a national debate
out of it.

""I have been seeing for the last 55 days, from the time I became chief
minister, the electronic media have made news as they want and have placed it
before people. Who will benefit out of it? Why are you doing it? Is there a
need?""

An emotional Kumaraswamy on Saturday had told JDS workers at a meeting in
Bengaluru that he was ""not happy"" being in the top post and was swallowing the
pain like 'Vishakantha'(Lord Shiva), who drank poison.

Union minister Arun Jaitley, in a Facebook post, has accused Congress of
driving Kumaraswamy to desperation. ""Listening to these statements of an
Honourable Chief Minister, my memory took me back to the dialogues of the
tragedy era of Hindi cinema,"" he said.

Senior Congress leaders in the state and the centre were also surprised over
Kumaraswamy's emotional remarks, which were seen in political circles as a
sign of coalition stress and strains.

Meanwhile, continuing its attack against Kumaraswamy, the

BJP

today asked him to resign if he is ""helpless and incapable"".

""From Hit&amp;amp;Run Kumaranna to U turn to now Kanneera (tearful) Swamy, his
political career has revolved around false promises, family welfare &amp;amp;
drama,"" Karnataka BJP said in a tweet.

It said ""If he is so helpless &amp;amp; incapable of taking decisions as CM, he
should resign from the CM seat prioritising his self-respect at the first
place.""

Reacting to BJP's tweet, JD(S) reminded it about its leaders getting
emotional, with photos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP patriarch L K
Advani, state BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi
Adityanath.

""Let's remind the leaders @BJP4Karnataka who are suffering from short term
memory loss that there are other ""great leaders"" cried in the past too,"" JD(S)
said in a tweet.

""We believe that crying is a form of expressing human emotions, we
@JanataDal_S respect &amp;amp; value human emotions,"" it added.

Seeking to put an end to the controversy on the issue, senior Congress leader
and minister D K Shivakumar termed Kumaraswamy an ""emotional person"".

""People have said what they had to, so leave it there. Let's give an
opportunity to the chief minister to work. There is no meaning in embarrassing
(anyone) by making it an issue,"" he said.

""We have seen him reacting emotionally to certain situations in the past and
naturally according to his behaviour while speaking to his party workers he
has got emotional.""

""There is nothing to interpret in a wrong way...if chief minister is happy,
the state will be happy,"" Shivakumar, who is considered to be Kumaraswamy's
bete noire, told reporters.

Karnataka PCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao held a meeting with party
spokespersons here and asked them to defend the coalition government and
partner JDS whenever they give statements to the media, top Congress sources
said.

""We were told that whenever a situation like this (chief minister in tears)
arises, we must explain to our audience that the chief minister is an
emotional person and we all have been sincerely cooperating with him,"" a party
spokesperson said.

C'mon, nobody would and must forget Emergency, and that is exactly why any sign of authoritarianism is detested. Don't you see that?

Are you interpreting that we should be okay with Modi's dictatorial style 'today', because Indira Gandhi was also like that 'yesterday'? 

How many Modi-Shah type leaders do you see in Congress,..wait  for it....'today'? Even if they are I am sure there Muslim appeasement policy will not be as strong and blatantly open as 'today's', and as a bonus there would be a genuine economist to guide them.

In a country like India, identity based politics is a parrallel phenomenon, to put it mildly. People know it exists, but generally there has been a broader concern for keeping things together, for peace, existence. Congress may or may not be different from BJP wrt that. But I can't imagine a coalition govt remaining silent if say a congress PM says something communal, and does nothing when ministers keep making divisive remarks so consistently. I am hopeful that people will not fear for their lives when speaking out against ministers/leaders/members of parliament having free tongue. And that idea comforts me a little. 
The peculiar problem with BJP however is that its ideology is so dangerous that even if you have a less authoritarian, in fact a democratic leader like Vajapayee as PM, he can't dare to upset the Hindutva supporters if something like Modi-2002-riots happen. I know politics is far dirtier than we can even imagine, but  to repeat your point, I am going to reject those who are much worse along the lines of democratic values.

**RTI amendment Bill: Activists say bid to wreck Act, former CIC says ‘may be an act of vengeance’** 

 ______ 
Written by

Manoj Dattatrye More

Published: July 19, 2018 8:15:17 am

The Bill, which the government intends to introduce in Parliament’s Monsoon
Session, which started on Wednesday, is aimed at giving the Centre the power
to fix the tenures and salaries of state and central information
commissioners.

Right to Information (RTI) activists have expressed apprehensions about the
Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2018, and cautioned that the amendment
could dilute or weaken the Act. The Bill, which the government intends to
introduce in Parliament’s Monsoon Session, which started on Wednesday, is
aimed at giving the Centre the power to fix the tenures and salaries of state
and central information commissioners.

Currently, the salaries and tenures of central and state information
commissioners are statutorily protected as they are provided in the RTI Act.
Former Central Information Commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi said the move
seemed to be a fall-out of the Central Information Commission’s orders to
respond to RTIs about the educational qualification of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi.

“What does this mean ? The central government wants complete control of the
system. It is a move aimed at completely wrecking the autonomy and
independence of the RTI Act. When the Act itself provides for the salaries and
tenures of the information commission, why is there a need for the government
to meddle with it,” asked RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar.

Kumbhar said when the Act was introduced in 2005, Parliament had discussed the
issue threadbare. “The emphasis of Parliament was on giving autonomy and
independence to information commissions, both at the Centre and the state. Now
this government seems to be bent on doing away with the autonomy and
independence of the commission,” he said. Kumbhar warned that the amendment
Bill could not only dilute the Act, it could also spell its doom.

Former Central Information Commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi

He pointed out that the RTI Act already has a provision for the removal of
information commissioners. “If a complaint is made to the President, he refers
it to the Supreme Court, which probes the complaint and makes recommendations
to the President. The Central Chief Information Commissioner or any
Information Commissioner can be removed from office only by the order of the
President, on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. This happens
only after the Supreme Court probes the complaint on a reference made to it by
the President,” he said.

Similarly, at the state level, the governor has the power to take a decision
about the removal of state chief information commissioners and information
commissioners. Former CIC Shailesh Gandhi said by bringing in the amendment,
the government was “violating the pre-legislative consultative policy”. “There
is no valid reason for the government to amend the Act. The only possibility
is that the central government seems to be annoyed about the CIC’s orders to
disclose the educational qualification of the Prime Minister… it could be an
act of vengeance or arrogance,” he said.

Gandhi said this could be a “trial balloon” by the government, aimed towards
an effort to lay the ground for a much bigger amendment. “My worry is that the
government will bring in a major amendment after this test balloon…,” he said.
He, however, disagreed with the contention that the move could “spell doom”
for the RTI Act. “It will weaken the Act for sure, but will not take away the
powers of the information commissioners,” he said.

Gandhi said the UPA government had thrice tried to bring in amendments to the
RTI Act, but could not do so due to protests. Another RTI activist, Maruti
Bhapkar, said the statements and objects of the Bill stated that the RTI Act
was enacted to promote transparency and accountability of every public
authority towards citizens. “But by amending the Act, the government is
seeking to make the commissions accountable to it and seeking to destroy its
transparent functioning,” he said. Bhapkar said if the central government had
the power to decide the tenures and salaries of information commissioners, the
commissioners would be “under pressure not to annoy the government, which
means they would be biased on delivering justice”. “The existence of such a
justice delivery system is against the spirit of the Constitution,” he said.

**Atal Pension Yojana: This Modi govt scheme will give you Rs 36,000/year after the age of 60, if you start investing just Rs 126/month now** 

 ______ 
Under this government-run pension scheme, a contributor has three payment
modes of contributions which are monthly, quarterly and half-yearly. (PTI)

**Modi Govt Scheme:** Atal Pension Yojana (APY) was launched by the Narendra Modi government in 2015 and is a government-run scheme. This is basically a pension scheme meant for social security. Under this scheme, a person can begin investing between the age of 18-40 years. They will earn a fixed minimum monthly return ranging from Rs 1000 to Rs 5000. The return depends on the contribution and the age when the investment was started by the depositor.

Under this government-run pension scheme, a contributor has three payment
modes of contributions which are monthly, quarterly and half-yearly. If a
person chooses to do a monthly investment of Rs 126, s/he will get a minimum
guaranteed return of Rs 3000 per month after the age of 60. When the return is
added up, it adds up to Rs 36,000 yearly pension after investing for 42 years.
All they need to do is open a savings account either with a bank or a post
office.

For quarterly and half-yearly the deposition amount will vary.

(NSDL).

**How do you apply for Atal Pension Yojana online?**

The APY subscriber form is available online on all bank websites. Interested
people need to download the form, fill in the required details and submit it
to their banks. Other necessary documents also have to be submitted and
applicants can then easily open an Atal Pension Yojana account.

Charges for default: Banks are required to collect an additional amount for
delayed payments. Such amount will vary from minimum Re 1 per month to Rs 10
per month.

• Re. 1 per month for a contribution up to Rs. 100 per month.

• Re. 2 per month for a contribution up to Rs. 101 to 500/- per month.

• Re 5 per month for contribution between Rs 501/- to 1000/- per month.

• Rs 10 per month for contribution beyond Rs 1001/- per month.

**Note:** The fixed amount of interest/penalty will remain as part of the pension corpus of the subscriber.

If a person fails to do the payment of contribution amount for six months,
his/her account will be frozen. After 12 months the account will be
deactivated and after 24 months the account will be closed.

**Withdrawal:**

– On attaining the age of 60 years: The exit from APY is permitted at the age
with 100 per cent annuitisation of pension wealth. On exit, the pension would
be available to the subscriber.

– In case of death of the Subscriber due to any cause: In case of death of
subscriber, pension would be available to the spouse and on the death of both
of them (subscriber and spouse), the pension corpus would be returned to his
nominee.

– Exit before the age of 60 years: Exit before 60 years of age is not
permitted. However, it is permitted only in exceptional circumstances, i.e.,
in the event of the death of the beneficiary or terminal disease.

**Eligibility:**

– APY is applicable to all citizen of India aged between 18-40 years.

– Aadhaar will be the primary KYC. Aadhaar and mobile number are recommended
to be obtained from the subscribers for the ease of operation of the scheme.

Modi in the previous election in 2014, to promise voters better days ahead
after 10 years of Congress rule. It soon became wildly popular among BJP
supporters. The phrase also became the first target of Congress attacks when
it took on the Modi government over demonetization and other steps.

**CBI vs CBI, CBI vs ED: top probe agencies caught in their own fight** 

 ______ 
Written by

Deeptiman Tiwary

| New Delhi |

Updated: July 19, 2018 10:48:05 am

The July 12 CVC meeting, which exposed the rift between Verma and Asthana, was
about granting extension of tenure to CBI joint directors A Y V Krishna and
Sai Manohar.

From the PNB scam involving Nirav Modi to the Vijay Mallya case, from
AgustaWestland to the AirAsia case and from allegations of corruption against
former Railway Minister Lalu Yadav to former Finance Minister P Chidambaram,
the two premier investigating agencies of the government, the Central Bureau
of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, are engaged in over 50 cases
involving top politicians and big corporates. Most of these are at a sensitive
stage given the run-up to the general elections and both agencies are locked
in a squabble that threatens to undermine each one’s institutional integrity.

The latest front to have opened in this battle is the war right at the top of
the CBI. As reported by The Indian Express on July 23, the CBI has sent a note
to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) that its second most senior officer
Rakesh Asthana could not be allowed to represent the agency director Alok
Verma in an official meeting since he was under probe.

Sources have told The Indian Express that there are differences visible
between CBI and ED in several cases, key among them being the AirAsia case.
While the CBI registered an FIR and called Tata Trusts’ R Venkatramanan for
questioning, the ED probe in the matter has hardly moved forward.

The July 12 CVC meeting, which exposed the rift between Verma and Asthana, was
about granting extension of tenure to CBI joint directors A Y V Krishna and
Sai Manohar. Also under consideration was the extension of tenure of DIG M K
Sinha and regularisation of the transfer of DIG Anish Prasad from his parent
cadre to CBI.

**READ | No. 1 vs No. 2: War in CBI is out in the open**

Sai Manohar was once part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by
Rakesh Asthana. The SIT had key cases, including AgustaWestland deal, the INX
Media case, the IRCTC hotels case and the Vijay Mallya case among others,
under its probe.

With deepening chill between Verma and Asthana, most of these cases have been
taken away from this SIT. Prasad had been repatriated recently to his parent
cadre of Tripura, along with chief probe officer of the Nirav Modi case Rajeev
Singh. Prasad has been brought back to the agency.

CBI: Rakesh Asthana (left) and Alok Verma.

The CVC meeting was to also consider a list of over 50 officers which it had
given to CBI to consider for induction. This included UP cadre IPS officer
Jyoti Narayan whose case, the CBI letter to CVC said, was being pushed by
Asthana. The letter said that Narayan, with some other officers to be
inducted, was under probe in certain CBI cases.

The divide can be traced back to October 2017 when it was revealed that CBI
Director Verma had opposed the promotion of Asthana to the post of Special
Director through a representation to the CVC. The representation alleged that
during investigations of the Sterling Biotech case — in which the Gujarat-
based company is accused of cheating banks of Rs 5,000 crore — evidence had
surfaced of alleged irregularities by Asthana.

Incidentally, the submission made by the CBI director was an unsigned
confidential note which the CVC rejected on the ground that the allegations
made in it were “unverifiable”. Soon, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant
Bhushan held a press conference where he released pages from a diary seized by
CBI during a raid in the case and alleged that Asthana had been paid in excess
of Rs 3.8 crore by the company.

**READ | Over 300 corruption cases registered by CBI this year: Govt**

Sources, however, said that Asthana had one of the company’s offices rented at
his premises in Gujarat and some of the payments mentioned in the diary were
actually rent paid by the company. The matter, however, was not probed further
and in November last year the Supreme Court held the promotion of Asthana to
the post of special director to be correct.

The CVC and SC clearance to Asthana notwithstanding, the CBl’s latest letter
to CVC says that Asthana’s conduct is still under probe.

Another reason behind the squabble, officials say, is the fact that certain
recommendations made by Verma for induction of some officers into the CBI were
not accepted by the government.

And after Asthana’s elevation, things only turned for the worse.

Once handling almost all politically sensitive and serious cases within the
CBI, Asthana was slowly divested of key responsibilities but except for
AgustaWestland and the Bofors case.

Quarrel also broke out within the agency between other officers. A CBI cadre
officer stationed in Lucknow wrote to CBI headquarters that the role of a
senior CBI officer — who was later involved in the probe of the Nlrav Mod case
— should be probed for interfering in a case related to the Delhi-based
officer’s brother.

However, the CBI opened a preliminary enquiry against the junior officer. It
was alleged that to avenge his brother’s firing from a company, the officer
had implicated the company in a false case. The officer challenged the PE in
the Allahabad High Court but lost the case and was even fined.

The officer investigating the Nirav Modi case, however, was recently
repatriated to his parent cadre prematurely.

While all this was going on within the CBI, a petition was filed by journalist
Upendra Rai against ED joint director Rajeshwar Singh in a court that he be
investigated far amassing disproportionate wealth. The petition was rejected
by the court.

Weeks after this, CBI booked Rai for alleged extortion and arrested him. He
was allegedly found to be in possession of call data records of several people
and confidential financial intelligence documents. It was alleged that he was
accepting bribes an behalf of Income Tax officials to settle cases of certain
companies.

In months, however, another petition with almost the same allegations was
filed by another journalist, Rajneesh Kapoor, against Rajeshwar Singh. The ED
joint director, who has probed important cases such as the CWG and the 2G scam
and is currently probing the Aircel-Maxis case, filed a contempt petition
against the journalist in Supreme Court. The apex court had earlier granted
Singh immunity from probes on such allegations.

On June 27, however, the government intervened in the matter and gave a
confidential Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;amp;AW) input of a call between a
suspected “ISI agent” and Rajeshwar Singh in a sealed cover. Based on this,
the court allowed the government to probe allegations against him.

The very same evening, BJP RS member Subramanian Swamy held a press conference
and revealed the details of the R&amp;amp;AW input. The ED rose in defence of its
officer and issued a press note where it said that the call had been only
received by the officer and that it was regarding a case related to bank
fraud. It said the officer had informed the agency and the matter had been
taken on record.

Asthana and Rajeshwar Singh declined to comment. Verma was unavailable for
comment.

**Biggest Smartphone Plant Masks PM Modi's 'Make In India' Struggle: Report** 

 ______ 
Under PM Modi, record foreign direct investment has flowed into India. (File)

Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in
celebrated the inauguration of what Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. called the
world's largest mobile phone factory. At the splashy event just outside New
Delhi, PM Modi said the facility was ""extremely important"" for his Make in
India initiative to boost manufacturing to 25 percent of India's economy by
2020 and create millions of jobs. Samsung said the plant was a ""shining
example"" of the success of the program.

But the investment is more the exception than the norm. Data from the World
Bank and the Reserve Bank of India show manufacturing hasn't received a
significant boost since PM Modi took office in 2014.

While India's economy has overtaken France to become the world's sixth
largest, manufacturing has shrunk to about 15 percent of gross domestic
product from a peak of 18.6 percent in 1995, according to the World Bank.
Other data show new investments in India have dropped and stalled projects are
on the rise.

""The Samsung announcement is good news, but it must be seen as a one-off at
present,"" says Vivek Dehejia, an associate professor of economics at Carleton
University in Ottawa. ""Make in India is a noble aspiration of the Modi
government. Yet, in the absence of a supporting infrastructure and ease of
doing business environment, it's a tough challenge.""

The initiative is a worthwhile attempt to lure global businesses, analysts
say, but it hasn't been accompanied by enough meaningful changes to revive
manufacturing or alter what is essentially a services-oriented economy.

PM Modi and the South Korean president travelled to Noida for the Samsung
factory launch. (File)

**Made in China**

Spokesmen for the Prime Minister's Office and the commerce ministry didn't
respond to requests for comment.

Unlike Beijing's Made in China 2025 program -- which targets strategic
industries from robotics to new-energy vehicles through state investment and
subsidies - PM Modi's Make in India plan is more of an investment promotion
strategy.

One of the key reforms under the initiative launched in 2014 was the loosening
up of foreign investment restrictions in several sectors, including defense.

However, private data shows investment is falling. The Centre for Monitoring
Indian Economy show new project investments have dropped to 6.62 trillion
rupees ($96.6 billion) in the financial year ended March from 18.7 trillion
rupees in fiscal 2015.

**Over-Capacity**

The value of stalled projects climbed to 7.63 trillion rupees from 5.29
trillion during that period. Even data from the Reserve Bank of India's
bulletin show that corporate capital expenditure has fallen since PM Modi came
to power.

PM Modi's Make in India project hasn't worked, in part because Indian
companies invested heavily for years until 2012, well before his election, and
now have excess industrial capacity, said Mahesh Vyas, CMIE's chief executive
officer.

""It now needs to wait for these capacities to be absorbed fully before new
capacities are built aggressively again,"" Vyas said. He added ""the world has
become a lot more protectionist and is more keen to retain employment on its
shores than exporting these to other countries.""

Those capacities have done little to temper growth in imports of foreign-made
goods. Rising purchases of smartphones and TVs have made electronics India's
second-biggest import item after oil, and is pushing the nation's trade
deficit wider.

Under PM Modi, record foreign direct investment has flowed into India and the
country's ease of doing business ranking has improved. Most investment, such
as Amazon.com Inc.'s $5 billion commitment to expand operations in India, has
gone into the nation's dominant services and technology industries.

FDI remains just 1.2 percent of India's overall investment, according to
Bloomberg Economics analyst Abhishek Gupta. High-profile investments from
foreign firms ""should not be confused with an overall improvement in
investment activity in India,"" he said.

With more jobs created in the services sector, PM Modi's program should focus
on investments there, said Gupta.

""Job creation in India could hugely benefit if Make in India's focus is
expanded to include more services, relative to its overemphasis on
manufacturing,"" Gupta said. ""India's tough labor laws and higher bureaucratic
entry barriers into manufacturing, along with its widespread fluency in
English -- a boon in global services -- suggests that its comparative
advantage lies in services.""

Even the Make in India program's mascot -- a lion composed of gears -- hasn't
avoided the onerous regulations and occasional political interference that are
still common in India and a key obstacle to investment.

__

A large lion statue, built by one of India's state-owned companies to promote
the manufacturing program, reportedly ran afoul of rules when it was placed
outside the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion in New Delhi. And a
separate branding exercise involving colorful lion structures in Mumbai led to
accusations they violated local heritage regulations.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given a lavender wash to the new Rs 100
note which will be in circulation by next month. Two years ago, when Prime
Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetization of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500
notes, the powder blue Rs 100 note was left untouched. It was soon the most
sought-after currency note in India till the new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 arrived
in the banks.

The new violet note is part of the revised design series introduced after
demonetization in November 2016. The latest variant features Gujarat's 'Rani
Ki Vav' (queen's stepwell) along with the Swachh Bharat logo and slogan on its
reverse. Gandhi _ji_'s placement remains the same.

""The base colour of the note is lavender. The note has other designs,
geometric patterns aligning with the overall colour scheme, both at the
obverse and reverse. Dimension of the banknote will be 66 mm x 142 mm,"" the
RBI said in a statement.

All the Rs 100 notes issued by the Reserve Bank in the earlier series will
continue to be legal tender, the RBI said.

The new note is slightly smaller than the existing one and bigger than the Rs
10 note. Once the new notes arrive, the banks may have to again recalibrate
the ATMs to accommodate the new notes, after settings had to be changed to
dispense new notes of Rs 2,000, 500 and 200 notes in 2016.

In 2014, UNESCO had recognised Gujarat's 'Rani-ki-Vav', the 11th-century
wonder in Patan, as a World Heritage Site. It will make a grand debut on this
new Rs 100 note.

__

The 200-rupee note with a base colour of bright yellow bears the motif of
Sanchi Stupa. The chocolate brown Rs 10 note has Konark Sun Temple on the
reverse side. The fluorescent blue Rs 50 notes features Stone Chariot in
Hampi, another world heritage site recognised by UNESCO.

434,"I am not sure what will happen. Please note that the following comments are not my preference, rather it is what I think will happen:

1. BJP swept RJ, MP, UP and GJ in 2014. Zero seat for Congress in RJ and MP - total 149 seats out of 160 seats in this 4 states. Add to it MH : 41/49 (including SS). Can this be repeated? 
2. Somebody wrote that this is a black swan event and can not be repeated. 
3. Where BJP can make up deficit are WB (2/42), OD (1/21), NE (8/23). Total scope for improvement : 75 seats.
4. I don't think BJP can do much improvement in KL, AP and TN.
5. So even if BJP lose significantly in RJ (as expected), MH and UP (likely), they can still cover it up as noted in 3 above. 
6. So key here would be Mamata Banerjee. If she can hold her own, BJP can kiss its dream goodby. I expect BJD to lose significantly in OD. 
7. Another key would be BSP+SP. If they can not combine, BJP may again sweep UP. Even in the recent Kairana by polls where BJP lost the margin was very narrow. So unless opponents are combined, BJP will steamroll.
8. Key for Congress would be to give control to local state leaders. BJP will be comfortable as long as the battle is Modi vs Rahul.
9. So this is a very open game. What some people may miss that the lower strata of people love Modi and they are happy that most of middle and upper middle class are not happy. 
10. What can be predicted that voting percentage, specially in urban area, would be down significantly.  ",2018-07-19 16:41:35

We cannot let the governments decide what education to be delivered to the children as political parties hope for gains from education also. Recent example would be the Modi gov. declaring they would include study material in the courses on emergency period I'm not saying it shouldn't be done but the way they presented it was for political gain over other party. Political parties would never have a press conference claiming they included topics like why Sati Pratha was inhumane and why was it removed, same goes for Tripple Talakh.

We need education which lets build a nation whose citizens can understand **humanity** is the first priority and then comes the religion and any rule in religion which isn't humane needs to be ruled out. Education will also help citizens to become rational people who won't go on rioting in the streets just after reading a Whatsapp message.

&gt;Hinduism is one of the most peaceful religions in the whole world. 

what about the militant and terrorist ideology like hindutva?

&gt;When Mumbai was attacked the terrorist Kasab was actually wearing a Kalawa a red sacred thread and tried to pose as a Hindu. The term Hindu terrorism was coined by A congress leader, they released a book claiming that 26/11 was a conspiracy by Hindus. But we were fortunate that one policeman caught Kasab alive and it was clear that he wasn't a Hindu.

your conspiracy theory has the timeline all mixed.


 &gt;In many instances Muslims pose as hindus by using fake names or wearing some religious symbol so I would say the opposite has been tried a lot but fortunately they didn't succeed.

so all the lynchings, beef killings, child rapes and murder of rationalists and jounalists is being done by muslims posing as hindus? bollocks.


&gt; In past a few cases have taken place where Hindus were convicted but none of the charges could be proved against them.

Yes, they are making videos of proudly owing up to killing people on the name of beef and love jihad, they are bring garlanded by hindutva bigots, they are honoured. What about all the proud hindu groups and ''senas'' who go about lynching people? who killed gauri lankesh and other rationalists?


&gt; If you take a look at Jammu Kashmir or North east's demography you will see that the number of Hindus is going down. Specially in Kashmir a mass exodus of hindus took place you can google Kashmiri pandit exodus, in which other country the people from majority religion have to live as refugees? To this date they can't back, women were raped, kids were killed. Their homes were taken over by fellow muslims they grew up with. 

How does that answer OP about hindu terrorism? because islam has terrorised people its the turn of hindutva groups?


Most will talk about Godhra riots to tell the Hindus are the real villains and Muslims are the victims. Riots took place after a whole bogie full of Hindus was burnt, what happened after that was retaliation (not commenting if it was right or wrong). In police firing more hindus died that Muslims. Every year journalists tweet about the riots but never about the 70-80 Hindus that were burnt alive. Anurag kashyap and his likes are trying to create a narrative which doesn't exist. 

&gt;India has faced Mughal brutality for years. 100s of temples were demolished in their rule. Many were converted to Mosques (Google Gyanwapi mosque). 

lol why dont u go to prehistoric times now to justify the present? 

&gt;If a Muslim is killed by a hindu it's all over the news when the opposite happens it's brushed aside.


aww fake news! muh narrative of false victimisation!

 &gt;A Man is facing jail because he said something derogatory about prophet mohammed, a 17 year old boy was put in jail because he wrote a facebook post against Islam.

yes and people who said anything against adityanath and modi, what happened to them? what happened to those rationalists who dare speak sense? 

 &gt;There is already an influx of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas and govt cant do anything in Muslim majority areas because they are being sheltered. 

More Fake FUD. why cant your bold hindutva god modi not do anything about it? is it not his majority government?

&gt;There are so many islamic countries and hardly 2-3 Hindu countries yet we have to fight for our Rights. 

India is not a hindu country, get this in your head.
maybe instead of trolling you educate yourself and not get your info from watsapp forwards and brainwashing facebook pages.


I don't know how does the likes of Anurag Kashyap have the gall to say that Hindus are the terrorists.

If a terrorist is muslim, its islamic terrorism, if a terrorist is hindu, it is hindu terrorism. Doesnt need gall, just common sense.

**I fail to understand the ‘foreign accent’ of Shashi Tharoor: Piyush Goyal**

By:

Express Web Desk

| New Delhi |

Updated: July 19, 2018 8:53:21 pm

Union Minister Piyush Goyal speaks in the Lok Sabha during the Monsoon session
of Parliament, in New Delhi on Thursday, July 19, 2018. (LSTV screengrab via
PTI)

Union Finance Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that he doesn’t
understand the “foreign accent” of Congress leader Shashi Tharoor. Attacking
the NDA government while participating in the debate on Fugitive Economic
Offenders Bill, the Congress leader from Kerala said that there was a
‘significant gap’ between the government’s rhetoric and action.

Continuing his attack on the government, Tharoor said Nirav Modi, who had fled
the country after allegedly duping state-run banks of crores of rupees, was
seen in a group picture with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Davos. He then
added that the PM had promised to be a ‘chowkidar’.

Responding to him, Goyal said he failed to understand the “foreign accent” of
Tharoor. This statement of Goyal was objected to by RSP member N K
Premachandran, who is also Tharoor’s fellow MP from Kerala. Premachandran, who
came into Tharoor’s defence, said, “It is not fair on the part of the
minister” to pass such comments. Later when Parliamentary Affairs Minister
Ananth Kumar intervened in the matter, Premachandran retorted that he had
every right to do so, since the minister had made an observation about a
member of the opposition.

Shashi Tharoor, who is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, is well known
for his strong command over the English language. Prior to his entry in the
politics, Tharoor served extensively at the United Nations, where he had
unsuccessfully contested for the UN Secretary General’s post.

**Rs 1,484 crore spent on PM Modi’s foreign travel since 2014: Govt** 

 ______ 
An expenditure of Rs 1,484 crore was incurred on chartered flights,
maintenance of aircraft and hotline facilities during Prime Minister Narendra
Modi’s visits to 84 countries since June 2014, according to the government.

The details of Modi’s foreign travel expenditure under the three heads were
shared in the Rajya Sabha by Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh.

According to the data, a total of Rs 1088.42 crore was spent on maintenance of
the prime minister’s aircraft and Rs 387.26 crore on chartered flights during
the period between June 15, 2014 and June 10, 2018.

The total expenditure on hotline was Rs 9.12 crore.

Modi visited a total of 84 countries in 42 foreign trips since taking over as
prime minister in May 2014.

The details provided by Singh did not include expenditure on hotline
facilities during his foreign visits in 2017-18 and 2018-19. The cost of
chartered flights for visits in 2018-19 was also not included.

According to Singh’s reply, the prime minister visited a maximum of 24
countries in 2015-16 followed by 19 in 2017-18 and 18 nations in 2016-17.

In 2014-15, Modi had visited 13 countries with the first one as prime minister
to Bhutan in June 2014. In 2018, he travelled to 10 countries with the last
one being to China last month.

The cost for chartered flights to overseas destinations in 2014-15 was Rs
93.76 crore while in 2015-16, it was Rs 117 crore. In 2016-17, the cost was Rs
76.27 crore and in 2017-18, the expense on chartered flight was Rs 99.32
crore.

“Diplomatic outreach during this period (since May 2014) has included first-
ever visits from India to several countries at the head of government level,”
Singh said.

He said the outreach has led to enhanced engagement of India’s foreign
partners in its flagship programmes.

The reservation system for jobs are being fought off (except for BPL's).

All this being done, in our last session, we brought up the issue of religion. She spoke about how Islam is fundamentally incorrect, everyone in this country is actually Hindu, and that's what Modi will try and bring back.

No one in India thinks Sikhs as a community are terrorists. They live here with dignity and are integrated in the country with everyone else. They aren't in danger. Indians are aware of a fringe brand of fundamentalists in abroad who have tried earlier in 80s to polarise and terrorise the population of Punjab.

**In Friday matinee of no-confidence, 3 key actors and a climax** 

 ______ 
Picture the debate on the no-confidence motion on Friday as a play. As the
contours of its climax are already known, nobody will be watching the play for
the last act (although its exact nature can be potentially revealing) but for
the performances.

In this drama, three key actors stand out – two present and one absent. While
their interplay will define the nature of the act, there will be many others
on the stage. The audience is both common and disparate, spread across
theatres. And each actor is hoping that his role will please his own target
audience.

**The spark**

The first character is an unlikely one.

N Chandrababu Naidu, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, is a veteran
politician and often likes to remind his interlocutors that he was still a
chief minister way back in the mid-90s when many of the current national and
state leaders were still struggling. It is Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP)
that set the ball rolling, or kicked off the act, by filing the no-confidence
motion over the Centre’s denial of special category status to his state.

This may seem like a region-specific issue, but it is striking how central
Andhra Pradesh has been to national politics in the last decade and a half. It
was because of the Congress’ spectacular performance in the state back in 2004
that it was able to oust the BJP from power in Delhi and form the United
Progressive Alliance. It did exceptionally well in 2009 too, making it an even
more dominant partner in Delhi. A key reason Congress lost political strength
in the run-up to the 2014 elections was because of its mismanagement of Andhra
Pradesh and the decision to eventually divide the state. The BJP was an
unlikely beneficiary. It allied with Naidu’s party and, together, they won
both the state and Lok Sabha polls.

Andhra and its internal politics continue to dominate the national theatre. It
was because of the internal competitive politics in the state – Naidu faces a
challenge from the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress Party – that the TDP
pulled out of the NDA government and exposed its faultlines earlier this year.
It raised the stakes on the demand for special category status and pulled
together a broader alliance on the issue, which included the Congress.

The play may have become a lot bigger than what initially triggered it. But it
will be useful to remember that Naidu’s hope of projecting himself as
effectively challenging BJP, and more broadly, Delhi – as a way to overcome
the YSR challenge – is the central driver of the current political churning.
Naidu will be absent from the main stage on Friday, but with the very fact
that a play is being performed in Parliament, he aims to convey a potent
message to his audience at home. That message, he hopes, would help him retain
power in the state and win a maximum of the 25 Lok Sabha seats from Andhra.

**The challenger**

If it was left only to Naidu, the act would have been limited.

It is Rahul Gandhi who took the baton and gave it a national colour. The
Congress decided to back the special category status demand as well as the no-
confidence motion for the twin purposes of slowly rebuilding its credibility
in Andhra Pradesh, whose people blame it entirely for the division of the
state, and enhancing its credibility with potential regional allies.

Friday’s speech will be the most important one delivered by Gandhi ever since
he became the Congress president. His address to the plenary of the party was
meant to boost the morale for Congress workers; his election rallies in
Karnataka were meant for a specific electorate. But the no-confidence motion
gives him an opportunity to take on the ruling establishment and prove his own
credentials before a national audience in the country’s most important
institution.

Here lies the rub. Since the climax of the play is pre-determined, Gandhi
knows he cannot change it. But what he can aim to do is bedazzle the audience
with a memorable performance, with phrases that remain in public memory, with
an act that will display what all his confidants and supporters claim is his
real persona rather than the caricature that has been created of him.

This will be possible only if Gandhi is able to strike the BJP where it hurts
the most, like he did with his “suit boot ki sarkar” jibe, which single-
handedly turned the policy direction of the government. This will be possible
only if he combines a solid policy critique with the rhetorical flourish that
so animates and moves the electorate. It will only be possible if he is able
to offer a coherent vision of his own that goes beyond the line of attack and
evokes faith because – remember – this is almost a pre-application to become
the lead actor in the real play to be enacted in 2019. And it will be possible
if he is able to address multiple audiences – those who already harbour
antagonistic sentiments towards the BJP and, far more importantly, others who
constitute the mass of non-committed floating voters across the country who
remain unconvinced about his capabilities.

It is a difficult task, but the stage could not be grander. And with his
performance, Gandhi has to not only stop the juggernaut of his principal
political rival but also turn it into an advantage for his own party and
project it as the anchor of the next coalition.

**Holding the crown**

But all eyes will be on the third actor, for Narendra Modi thrives in
political confrontation on the big stage.

When the climax ends up in his favour, it would be easy to assume that the
Prime Minister has a walk-on part. But remember that neither is the BJP a
party that rests easy nor is Modi a leader who would let go of any opportunity
to project strength while undermining his rivals. As he once told an MP during
the 2017 Uttar Pradesh elections: “Chunav jung hai aur main iska senapati (An
election is a battle, and I am its commander).”

Friday will also be a battle for Modi. His government has already sprung a
surprise by the ease with which it accepted the no-confidence motion on the
very first day of the house. This means that Modi – the lead actor – also
decided the timing of the play, and all others have had to adjust accordingly.
His squad has already declared that with the most effective actor on their
side, there is no reason to worry.

But Modi will have his own audience to please. He has to keep the core
supporters who have stayed on with the BJP through thick and thin happy. This
will be possible if the act involves a sharp political attack on all the
others on the stage, and a defence of the political worldview the government
has pushed over the last four years. He has to please the incremental voters
who joined in to support the BJP in the last election. This will be possible
if he delivers to them a solid defence of his government’s record. He has to
please the various components of his multi-class and multi-caste alliance –
the middle class that appears to feel they have lost out; the marginalised and
poor he has wooed with welfare initiatives but whose allegiances are fragile;
the farmers who remain distressed about prices; and the youth who find a
mismatch between abilities, opportunities and aspirations. Modi has to appeal
to the south and the east – the two regions the BJP still needs grow in – as
well as the heartland, the core belt they need to hold.

But most importantly, the lead actor has to ensure that the national audience
continues to have faith in his intent and integrity – which, probably, is the
key reason they have reposed faith in the BJP election after election and will
be its central plank in 2019.

**And the climax**

There will be other performances too, almost all of them driven by a strong
cost-benefit calculation.

Leaders who see the BJP as a primary threat in the state, whose worldview is
fundamentally opposed to that of the BJP, or whose audiences are fundamentally
antagonistic to the party, will display aggression. Think of the Trinamool
Congress or the Left. Leaders whose audiences do not particularly think about
the BJP, or who believe that a working relationship with the Centre is more
advantageous, could opt out of the climax. Think of the AIADMK or Telangana
Rashtra Samithi. On the other hand, leaders who have already bandwagoned with
the BJP will stick on and, despite differences, prove their loyalty. Think of
the Janata Dal (United), Shiv Sena or Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party.

But do not assume it’s curtains for the Opposition when the play ends with the
BJP emerging victorious.

It will only mark the first act in a drama that will continue till 2019. But
the performances themselves will reveal to the Indian audience – the vast
electorate in this complex democracy – what lies ahead and who stands on which
side.
