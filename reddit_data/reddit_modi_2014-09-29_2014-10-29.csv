2,It looks an attempt by him to take limelight from the mega event that came to existence due to Modi. ,2014-09-29 00:04:04
3,"&gt; A rather festive occasion for the Indian community in the US, the Madison Square Garden event was marred by some hooligans attacking the media. 

&gt; Here's TV Today Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai being abused and attacked by a mob outside the venue in New York. *This led to a scuffle where many Indians who were there to listen to Prime Minister Modi **came out to defend Mr Sardesai. They criticised the behaviour of those who tried to browbeat the media crews** by shouting slogans and behaving badly.* 

&gt; The organiser of the event, *Mr Vijay Jolly, came out and apologised to Mr Sardesai for the behaviour of the miscreants*. The **seasoned journalist that he is, Mr Sardesai took it in his stride and brushed it off as an unfortunate incident**, saying that things like this happen sometimes when you report live

Dont worry, once dear leader returns, they'll realize that people in India still couldn't care less about them. Idiots want to vote sitting in the us. Lol. No wonder the first thing any pio who wants to enter American politics does is reject his prod kulcha.Also Modi can sing and dance as much as he wants, but the Americans won't humor him at the cost of the Chinese, unless he's willing to behave as their puppets.And to those talking of an nri lobby.

15,"&gt; I am seriously saying that there is a good possibility he would have gotten lynched were this in, say, Ahmedabad.

fuck, he seriously would NOT even open his mouth in Ahmedabad.  That's why he stays put in Delhi or whatever.  He wouldn't even dare to go with PETA to a mosque even.

In this incident and you trying to tie it to democracy, it is the most cynical and hypocritical thing to do.  He needled the crowd, they jeered him back, one guy got under his skin verbally and RS lost his cool.

Right now, I don't see RS being beheaded or bombed to shit.  So Democracy is doing very well in India, thank  you fucking much.

The issue is that you can't stomach someone being jeered at;  Catcalling by 1 person ,RS versus the crowd.  You already know who the loser is.

Quite frankly I'm tired of consensus driven governance. We need more republicanism and handing over the reins to a single source of power for his elected term is exactly what the country needs, and voted for having seen the same in Gujarat.

And 2015 really is important, 100th anniversary of Return of Mahatma Gandhi, Nabakalebar festival in Puri(This thing is huge), IRNSS getting activated by Q4 2015. :)

And the way he laid down the points in a systematic manner, about what he was going to do with regard to the visas, was a nice change from the past where ministers would have said ""...you are having some visa problems, we are trying to get to the bottom of it"". I liked that Modi was very specific about what he will do.

Glad we caught the idiots on cam. Only way to shame the mob is to show them. 


But the show on cam only showed crowed chanting Rajdeep Murdabaad and heckling him.

If he truly caught the idots on cam, how come there was actual dhishum dhishum not publicised by Rajdeep and company?

It is almost they went to town with bhakts harassing Rajdeep with the video footage of the heckling. May be to compensate for the Rajdeep trolling and being abusive (One firangi journalist reported that he was certainly confrontational and called one guy an asshole. https://twitter.com/JFK_America/status/516256855698735104

I am not aware enough (about the shit-fest that is Indian media) to counter your points. Hence I asked the question in the first place.
 
However, I will add just a few points.

1. Always hold 'em accountable. No matter how great their previous track record is. Power corrupts, sooner or later. Always have, always will.

2. Supreme court is not a monolithic body. The same ""fucking Supreme Court"" upheld 377 and introduced the third gender law/bill. Not saying that Modi was responsible. Just saying that our justice system is not above questioning. Civil society. They are there for this reason.

3. Indian democracy is a circus but every one has a role to play. Swami is relevant because Owaisi is relevant. JNU jhola-walas are relevant because Dinanath Batra still gives interviews. I can't hate Mamata unreservedly because my alma-mater is hub of budding Maoists.

This is bang on. Everytime some relative or foreigner from abroad or even here starts an anti-modi rant i simply explain them that to be CM or PM in this country, you have to go through a lot of scrutiny from the State as well as Center. It's easy to say courts are corrupt, investigative agencies are corrupt blah blah, but if you think that everything from the low level courts, high courts and supreme courts, various committees and investigative agencies are corrupt then i have nothing but pity. 

Yes, you can hate or even be a skeptic about Modi and his deeds like i am. But please stop this 'everything is corrupt' nonsense.

The Court's main job is to interpret the law. The law is like it is. It's the job of the Parliament to change laws. Supreme Court upholding 377 isn't a big deal.  

That said, the Supreme Court didn't give a clean chit to Modiji like OP says. It was a team appointed by the Supreme Court which did. There is a difference. Modi was given a clean chit by SC means that he was tried and pronounced 'Not Guilty' - which is different from clean chit by sit.

Yes. Every person holding public office should be accountable. If Modi does something wrong, I will oppose it and condemn it. If he is convicted by courts for anything related to 2002 riots, I will stop supporting him. I am not a blind 'bhakt' as the very many jhollawalas here think BJP supporters to be. 

Ever heard of 'Innocent until proven guilty' ? I strongly believe in it. So, I will support Modi until he is proven guilty for 2002, or for some future corruption case or whatever.

108,"The Rajdeep Sardesai video no one will post on youtube or Social Media! Rajdeep was already trending on twitter after what happened earlier in the day before the Modi's speech at the Madison Square Garden. You guys saw that the video, didn't you. (This was shot before PM arrived at Madison Square Garden) But this is the episode that no one will tell you about, and in fact, I DARE EVERY ONE OF YOU WHO RECORDED THIS BUT WON'T POST IT FOR REASONS NOT TO BE NAMED. The Story Part II ( Right after the event at Madison Square Garden) I was at Times Square when I heard or in fact read about it as the screen out there flashed a tweet about Rajdeep's episode earlier in the day. Once done interviewing and usual stuff, took a walk down to Madison Square Garden. The Venue where Rajdeep was heckled in the morning. By the time I reached, the speech was still on, so took a pit-stop right across the street at my hotel to charge the batteries of my cell phone and my digicam. I return, interviewed a couple of people on their way out. But while I interviewed the last family, I hear some noise, quite different from 'Har Har Modi' or the 'Modi Modi' chant across the 7th Avenue. I turn around only to find Rajdeep Sardesai and a senior cameraperson in the middle of a mob trying to calm down a group of approximately 50 people around him. My first Reaction: Are these guys for real? Second reaction: To see if any other TV crew was there, none I barge in, just to check if Rajdeep was alright. Yes, he was. Smiling, calm, and trying to reason out a crowd which wasn't prepared to listen to anything he said. Then the pushing and shoving begins. A barrage of abuses follow. Why? Probably because of Rajdeep's tweet about an influential person staying in the same hotel as Narendra Modi's The mob called him by names and hurled the choicest of words towards him. When I tried to shield the fellow journalist, I realised, that I became a target as well. This went on for good 10-15 minutes. The NYPD was right there, but won't blame them for not knowing what was going on in the middle of that crowd of 50 odd people. The cameraman had to ensure his equipment was safe, so was trying his best he could, to fend off a few people who tried to come closer to Rajdeep. This went on for good 10 minutes. Despite my repeated requests to stay away from Rajdeep, the mob continued to shout pro-Modi slogans right in front of his face to instigate him. A particular person wearing glasses, and once again in an orange attire, almost shoved his phone into the cameraman's lens to which Rajdeep protested. Luckily, fellow scribes Mohit Roy Sharma and Bhupendra Chaubey arrived at the scene. Three of us literally made a human chain, to get Rajdeep out of that place. I'm sure all of this is on tape as the cameraman might have stopped recording, but the PCR back in India would have everything that transpired in front of that camera lens. I say this with conviction that a lot of people had their cameras rolling as well. The abuses, the pushing and shoving, and the instigation, all on tape. Yes, you have every right to be a supporter, but let's not mix a fan with a fanatic. Learn to respect other people. Learn to respect to earn respect. Just a few minutes ag o, the Prime Minster delivered a lovely speech about peace and how India is a great democracy. But you guys defy all logic.

Shouldnt that come from witnesses and evidence(s) ? Police is only supposed to investigate, right ? Moreover, say there was a cover-up job, wont there be some traces, of the same ? Surely the scores of investigative teams must have picked up something, *anything* ?",2014-09-29 12:38:56
110,"By witnesses, are you talking about the people who were on-ground when the riots happened? They could testify if there were BJP men and could identify the people who were part of the mobs (that's how Kodnani got implicated). 

The accusation on Modi is he deliberately stopped the police forces from taking action. That's an administrative crime that people on ground cannot testify upon. Only people who have orders from the top machinery would be able to testify. 

Like when Jayalalitha got arrested last week, there was one group of ADMK men who gathered up close to my house to burn Stalin's effigy. A neighbour told me that the DSP (or some head police guy) who was in the neighborhood told him that Rosiah (the governor) had been informed that the situation is going to go bad and they need a go-ahead. But he was deliberately keeping himself away by attending some function or something of that sort (sorry, it's all hear-say). Nobody died and nothing apart from property was lost. But if you have to make a case against this, Rosiah should be investigated - and the police my neighbor talked about should be the one to testify. 

&gt;Moreover, say there was a cover-up job, wont there be some traces, of the same ?

Police are required to testify, and they are the ones to uncover the traces. (in the initial days at least before it is transferred to the CBI or others). And they report to Modi who is the one being investigated.

Do realise this amount of hatred is not caused by one, two or even ten stray comments but is rather a result of his constant campaign of hate run against Modi and the rest of BJP. Of course Modi isn't perfect and neither is BJP. I believe many supporters in this forum are embarrassed by the antics of Mrs Irani, the lack of full time Defence Minister and other cringeworthy comments which come from the right wing camp every now and then. No one would be hated for pointing and criticising these out. But when you disrespect an entire set of people believing them to be ""class nahi aya"" kind of people simply cause they support the BJP, clearly something is horribly wrong with you. 

He is supposed to be a top journalist of this country right - which scams did he expose : 2G? CWG? CoalGate? No wait, he was busy showing fellow journalists their **moral compass** cause he is the sole arbiter of right and wrong in this country. Courts and the police be damned (and so be photographical evidence from yesterday now). 

The only scam he did come close to exposing was how **Cash4Votes** - this was just before the No confidence motion vote faced by UPA 1 after the communists quit the govt in protest of the Nuclear Deal. Amar Singh was helping out Ahmad Patel buy votes to save the government (Amar Singh had his own motives - friend Anil Ambani wanted the govt to back him vs Mukesh in the gas deal - read Gas Wars for more details). Some of the BJP guys went to CNN IBN asking them to do a sting exposing MPs being bought for 25 crores. After the sting had been done however, Rajdeep sat on those tapes and didn't release it (Baru has hinted Prithviraj Chavan asked him to be quite (and he was the junior minister in the PMO then)).

I mean, I could keep on typing and ranting, but better still, keep googling, read primary sources and not opinions which I, fellow redditors and worse still the journalists and peddling around. You'll find enough skeletons to pass the week.

im not saying i wish bad times upon TN. i just said that TN has been heavily reliant on this sort of thing for a while. and it needs to mature at some time or the other. people need to get the fact that leaders shouldnt be the only thing because we are in a democracy and this type of leader worship is unhealthy in the long run. considering she has been convicted now, it might be a good opportunity to change the systems towards a mature democracy. a democracy where if a beloved leader is convicted, people should accept that they were wrong in upholding the leader and pick a new one.",2014-09-29 13:18:10

126,"OK, longish answer.

1. Rajdeep (and a huge number of other journalists) were in Gujarat when 2002 happened. They came back with a distinct impression that Modi, the entire govt, police, bureaucracy were hand in glove in the riots. Books have been written about the amount of circumstantial evidence, anecdotes, private conservations, government's partisanship post riots etc. A very large number of journalists consider Modi a murderer by action or inaction.
**That does not mean that they are right. Or wrong.**

2. There was an SIT under the SC. The SIT gave a clean chit to Modi. The SIT's report itself, according to critics, gives a lot of evidence to suspect (not prove) that Modi had a hand in what happened. **Again, suspicion is not proof. And absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, bla bla**

3. Post Gujarat, a lot of journalists took a clear decision - majority communalism is much more dangerous than minority communalism. They saw violent Hindus at close quarters, and decided that this evil is worse than the other evil. Therefore, they started being gentle towards the underdog extremists (as Gujarat proved to them) and harsher on the top dog extremists. This meant a lot of soft pedalling Islamic extremism.

4. A lot of young people were kids when 2002 happened, uninterested in politics. They became politically aware later, and what do they see? Journalists questioning Modi regularly, being less harsh with Islamic fundamentalism.... and well, they decided that these journos are rubbish. The Modi they saw is a much more sophisticated Modi than in 2002. This man, they can like. Journalists see the other Modi, the one from 2002-2005. The new generation sees the dumber sickulars, but do not know how they became so, and instinctively dislikes it. On top of that, everyone dislikes Congress (the establishment party) as they become politically aware - and right now, there are a lot of young voters (18-30) who instinctively dislikes Congress and anyone who supports it.

5. Rajdeep and Barkha were the original 'secular' journalists. Therefore, they are disliked the worst. Barkha even more because well, she is female. On top of that, Rajdeep's arguments became simpler and dumber over the years. Why? Because TV audience prefered the simpler, dumber noise of Arnab - and Rajdeep tried to imitate him. This meant his 'sickularism' was easier to dislike. It was not even intellectual. It looked like every chance, he says ""2002"" sanghi, saffron, riot, adani etc etc. The earlier Rajdeep was someone you could sort of respect but disagree with. Now you had a 2014 edition dumber Rajdeep. 

6. Rajdeep had one or two run-ins with Modi, I remember the one in a bus where Modi looks outside and refuses to answer while Rajdeep keeps throwing questions at him. It was embarrassing for Rajdeep as a journalist, and embarrassing for Modi as a politician. ",2014-09-29 14:42:39

Who made these accusations? There is so much proof (including letters to neighboring govts) about his administration acting very quickly. 

As far as riots go, these riots iirc started on the 28th of Feb, by 1st March the army was flag marching on the streets. If you compare this to any riot, let alone a statewide conflagration, this was a very quick, efficient response.

There was this cop (forget his name) who claimed to be present in meetings where Modi issued these orders - it was later proved that he was not even in the same city when the meeting was taking place.

You have people saying that Babu Bajrangi's sting video is enough proof - the one where he says Modi himself said he will help those caught in the riots (paraphrasing) - I mean if this guy Modi is such a devious criminal that he can mastermind all this without leaving a trace behind, it boggles the mind that he would have spoken to this low level functionary and exposed his hand.

If there is no evidence, on what basis do people call him guilty of genocide / warcrimes and all other hyperbole that is bandied around here?

Sharma alleges that the mob was unwilling to listen to Rajdeep and then 'the pushing and shoving began'. According to him, the mob called Sardesai names and hurled the choicest of abuses towards him.

&gt; Meanwhile, the cameraman was attempting to protect his equipment and also faced the wrath of the crowd. Sharma claims that he personally tried to get the crowd to calm down, but instead a man in orange attire pushed his cell phone into the cameraman's lens, causing Rajdeep to protest.

He is one of those characters in fiction novels who think the whole world revolves around them. Take for example the campaign Modi and Barkha Dutt have been running for 12 years that Modi did the Gujarat riots. As someone affected by the 1984 anti-Sikh riots let me tell you this - one man cannot do riots and cannot be responsible for it. There is a social angle to this problem but the mainstream media, led by agendas of Congress sympathizers and pandering to the Western view which wants to paint Indians in the same shade as homicidal ISIS. Rajdeep is a self created man, essentially because no one takes him seriously except his own kind. His editorials in the Hindustan Times are so immature that you would assume he has outsourced this low value work to some lowly intern. Like other ""prestigious"" journalists like Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep has now graduated to become a power broker in the Indian politics which is on the other side of the spectrum.

Whats the one thing that John Stewart picked up from Modi's New York visit? That he was responsible for the genocide in Gujarat and banned from entering the US for a long time. Thats the impact people like Rajdeep and Barkha Dutt have been able to have thanks to the constant limelight given to them by the Congress administration. My bet is that sooner or later, this guy will join Congress and enter the Rajya Sabha. The seed has  been sown by Modi supporters in New York, but who will bear the vengeance?

The religious chauvinists believe that raising questions on the events surrounding the riots in 2002 is not a valid journalistic activity.   ",2014-09-29 18:12:45
172,"Wait, Sanjiv Bhatt and Teesta are the witnesses in an environment where Modi heads the team who could possibly testify against him. If he had resigned and let the investigations happen, you might have seen many more people willing to testify (if he was guilty - we will never know). 

You cannot compare this with some rape claim by a wannabe. Modi's colleagues like Kodnani have been actually implicated in this case. It's not somebody's vendetta against him

The source is from the video you all hate - Final Solution. 9.30 minutes into the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uC278OX9BE

&gt;Sorry, but by that logic Indian states (MP till the BJP came in, UP every second month, Orissa, NE States, Jharkand etc) see riots very frequently, it will paralyse governance if the CM of the state steps down every single time.

Agreed. The government needs to make the police independent of the clutches of government officials. Modi is PM now. I wonder if he would dare do that now - that could reopen the Godhra case for him. Now that possibility is out of question, this is the only other alternative. And we are not talking about resignation calls after a flood or a railway accident which the actual minister may not have an actual hand in. This is a case where there were witnesses to the crime committed by the CM's own colleagues.

180,"FWIW, I think it's an insult for Modi to be compared with Obama. Modi is a far far better governor than Obama (which isn't saying much). Obama is a useless bum.

&gt; Barack Obama is also from middle class family and had difficult childhood

Not really. Obama was raised by his white grandparents who were reasonably well off.

&gt; Obama was popular to practice his style of politics from Chicago, Illinois

The phrase ""Chicago style politics"" is considered an insult in American politics - it means dirty &amp; corrupt politics. And Obama did practice dirty politics. He won his first local elections by stabbing his mentor in the back.

&gt; Barack Obama is also a powerful orator, huge crowd puller, and has immense public support

Obama is a good orator (in the bully pulpit style) as far as prepared speeches go. If it's extempore, he isn't that good, mainly because he isn't that smart or knowledgeable.

&gt; When selected for Presidential candidate, Barack Obama faced - To be  American President not possible for a black

Obama being black was a big reason for him to get elected. No inexperienced white guy who was as inexperienced as Obama could have become president. He got elected because of white liberal guilt.

&gt; Barack Obama had a path breaking election campaign and he used constructive communication with public

True. Obama's biggest (and possibly only) skill is campaigning. He is a master at that.

&gt; Obama gave hope to American people who were fed up of Republican George bush dynasty

True. And then killed it. 
2 of the worst US presidents back to back.

&gt; Barack Obama fought against dynasty - Republican Bush Family - And won with whopping margin

No, he didn't fight against the Republican Bush Family. In the primaries, he fought against Hillary &amp; in the general, he fought against McCain the first time &amp; Romney the 2nd time.

182,"If FP has paywalled it for you, here's the original article:
&gt; As Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes his first official visit to the
&gt; United States, one issue at the top of the trade agenda is the
&gt; strikingly different approaches of the Indian and U.S. governments
&gt; toward intellectual property for medicines, particularly when patented
&gt; life-saving medicines are priced out of reach of patients.
&gt; 
&gt; As the ‘pharmacy of the developing world’, India plays an immensely
&gt; important role in supplying affordable medicines to people worldwide.
&gt; These include many patients treated in Doctors Without Borders/Medecins
&gt; Sans Frontieres (MSF) medical projects in more than 60 countries,
&gt; including India.
&gt; 
&gt; But for years, India has faced a barrage of criticism and pressure from
&gt; the United States and the European Union, multinational pharmaceutical
&gt; firms, and their lobbyists over its progressive intellectual property
&gt; policies. In the United States, India is the target of unwarranted and
&gt; purposely misleading claims of unfair intellectual property laws and is
&gt; accused of not “playing by the rules.” The U.S. Trade Representative
&gt; placed India on its Special 301 Trade
&gt; [list](http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/USTR%202014%20Special%20301%20Report%20to%20Congress%20FINAL.pdf),
&gt; a blacklist of countries whose laws and actions do not comport with U.S.
&gt; interests on intellectual property, particularly those of the U.S.
&gt; pharmaceutical industry. Congressional hearings and an International
&gt; Trade Commission (ITC) investigation have also taken aim at India’s
&gt; policies.
&gt; 
&gt; In actual fact, India’s laws were
&gt; [changed](http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/pharmpatent_e.htm)
&gt; in 2005 to comply with the World Trade Organization’s mandates for
&gt; pharmaceutical patenting, and over the past decade India has granted an
&gt; increasing number of patents on medicines. 
&gt; 
&gt; So why is the U.S. pharmaceutical industry crying foul over India's
&gt; policies? It stems from the fact that India has a law that limits the
&gt; granting of secondary and unnecessary patents. This means that companies
&gt; are not granted patents for obvious modifications of existing products;
&gt; however, companies *are* granted patents for truly new medicines.
&gt; 
&gt; In the United States, it is standard practice for pharmaceutical
&gt; companies to file for and obtain multiple patents relating to different
&gt; aspects of the same medicine. It is a way to extend patent protection
&gt; and block generic competition.
&gt; 
&gt; After existing asthma medicines were allowed to be re-patented with
&gt; slightly modified inhalers, generic asthma inhalers disappeared from the
&gt; U.S. market. Protected by extended patent terms, asthma inhaler
&gt; patent-holders in the United States now charge exponentially higher
&gt; prices and have kept generic competitors out of the market long after
&gt; the patent on the original medicine expired. 
&gt; 
&gt; For more than seven years, Novartis fought India’s safeguard against
&gt; secondary patenting in court over one of its existing cancer drugs.
&gt; Novartis took the case to the Indian Supreme Court and
&gt; [lost](http://www.msfaccess.org/about-us/media-room/press-releases/indian-supreme-court-delivers-verdict-novartis-case). 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2012, for the first time, India issued a so-called ‘compulsory
&gt; license’ – when a government overrides a patent monopoly to make
&gt; medicines available to meet a public health need. This measure is used
&gt; to jumpstart generic production and allows generic manufacturers to
&gt; enter the market by paying a set royalty fee to the patent-holder.
&gt; India’s compulsory license authorized marketing of a more affordable
&gt; version of a liver and kidney cancer medication that Bayer was selling
&gt; for $6000 per month in India; generics are now available for less than
&gt; $200 per
&gt; [month](http://www.msfaccess.org/content/india-upholds-compulsory-licence-cancer-drug-bayer-case-appeal). 
&gt; 
&gt; To understand what is at stake, think back to the 1990s, when first-line
&gt; medicines for HIV/AIDS cost more than $10,000 per patient per
&gt; year. While many AIDS patients in the United States and Europe were
&gt; coming back to life thanks to antiretrovirals, people in developing
&gt; countries where MSF works continued to die simply because they, or their
&gt; governments, were unable to afford the price of treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; The Indian generic industry stepped up, offering to produce the same
&gt; first-line medicines for $1 a day. Today, 11 million people are on HIV
&gt; treatment in developing countries, with around 90% of medicines sourced
&gt; in India. Broad access to affordable HIV medicines has enabled an
&gt; unprecedented global response to a disease that once seemed completely
&gt; unstoppable.
&gt; 
&gt; India’s patent law and practices are favorable to public health, were
&gt; put in place through a democratic legislative process, and are in line
&gt; with international trade and intellectual property rules. Every country
&gt; has the right to set policies that balance private business interests
&gt; with public health needs.
&gt; 
&gt; India has forged a fair and progressive path in this arena that is
&gt; influencing its BRICS peers and other developing countries. South Africa
&gt; and Brazil are looking to reform their patent systems to encourage
&gt; public health-driven innovation and discourage patent abuse. Prime
&gt; Minister Modi should reject any attempts to turn India back from this
&gt; path. 
&gt; 
&gt; Beyond this, MSF sees the need for a bold new vision for biomedical
&gt; innovation where open access to scientific knowledge is promoted and
&gt; where research and development (R&amp;D) investments are not linked to the
&gt; price of products, thereby making medicines affordable for all who need
&gt; them. India can show even greater leadership by supporting proposals
&gt; being considered at the [World Health
&gt; Organization](http://www.who.int/phi/implementation/phi_globstat_action/en/)
&gt; and other national and regional forums to implement [new
&gt; models](http://www.msfaccess.org/push-pull-pool) for medical innovation.
&gt; Funding for medical R&amp;D, as well as vision, leadership and the right
&gt; policies, are needed to transform these proposals into action.
&gt; 
&gt; We urge the prime minister to stand firm in upholding India’s
&gt; intellectual property policies, which are in line with international
&gt; trade and intellectual property rules and which are the foundation of
&gt; India’s vitally important role in global health.
&gt; 
&gt; As a medical humanitarian organization that relies heavily on affordable
&gt; high quality medicines produced in India, we have seen firsthand the
&gt; lifesaving role that Indian laws and policies have played over the past
&gt; decade. We implore Prime Minister Modi to continue India’s leadership in
&gt; global health, innovation and access to medicines, by not only playing
&gt; by the rules but also by challenging them and changing the innovation
&gt; system so it better serves public health needs.

215,"1. You omitted the suppression of all scams until the story became too big to ignore. Name one scam (CWG, 2G or Coal) story that was broken by this lot. For the cash-for-votes, Rajdeep clearly suppressed evidence. For 2G, everyone who was anyone in Delhi knew what stunts Raja had pulled. None of the Delhi journos reported it. It took an obscure newspaper, pioneer, and an unknown journalist, Gopikrishnan to break the story and report it for more than an year before the Delhi journalists went anywhere near the story.

2. When anyone asks them why they did not report on these matters, or questions these people in any way, their response is an appeal to authority. ""Do not tell us how to do our jobs."" You can even hear this sentence in the NY confrontation videos doings the rounds. So basically, these fine arts graduates can tell everyone else - doctors, engineers, politicians, CEOs - how to do their jobs, but everyone else lacks the needed skills to even question their performance, let alone how to do their jobs.

3. The 2002 coverage, and peddling hateful lies, like xyz was a pregnant woman whose fetus was hurled about at the tip of a sword.. These stories fanned a lot of hate for hindus among muslim youth. Put it together with the Lalu special report about Godhra, and how uncritically these people accepted that report, and you can see how easily, in Muslim minds, a perception took hold that the Gujarat riots were entirely a conspiracy to kill muslims and win a state election. In this way, they contributed to the polarization, while putting on holier that thou attitudes about communal harmony.

4. The way they conducted panel debates, where one point of view was consistently suppressed is another reason. To give you an example, on the election results eve, NDTV had invited Sudheendra Kulkarni as the right wing point of view! A person who had experienced a bitter and public falling out with the Modi camp was there to represent the BJP. So on that panel, on the eve of the biggest mandate in 30 years, there was no voice that represented this mandate! This should clue you in to how disconnected these media houses had become from the general people after ten years as lapdogs of the UPA.

&gt; Post Gujarat, a lot of journalists took a clear decision - majority communalism is much more dangerous than minority communalism. They saw violent Hindus at close quarters, and decided that this evil is worse than the other evil. Therefore, they started being gentle towards the underdog extremists (as Gujarat proved to them) and harsher on the top dog extremists. This meant a lot of soft pedalling Islamic extremism.

5. This was not post Gujarat, this was first said by Nehru in the 50s. This has been the consistent pattern of reportage from these people for several decades now. The way they portrayed the janambhoomi dispute, the way some other riots were covered, it all exemplifies this problem.

230,"Why? What is idiotic about his statement?

----

With Iraq, the main problem was the war itself. Going in there was a mistake. I say this as someone who was there and as someone who remembers the lead-up to it.

Saddam was an asshole for sure, but he was also an asshole that curbed extremism. There is no good way to defend him, or even defend going in. The US rationale wasn't to save Iraqis, but it was about WMD, etc. So the Bush administration loses any moral high-ground they have (not that there was much to start with). Iraq was a country held together by Saddam's iron will. It is an artificially-created country; one created by European powers without any regard for centuries-long ethnic identities or conflicts. Much like in Africa and elsewhere in the world, they ended up with a gigantic clusterfuck. But we have Saddam, a huge asshole providing some semblance of normalcy, because quite literally, if anyone went out of line, he (or his sons) would kill them. 

When Saddam was removed, it was like taking the top off a pressure-cooker right before the whistle blows. All those ethnic conflicts came out. Prime among those was the Sunni-Shia conflict. Like many other countries in the ME, Iraq was a Shia majority ruled by a Sunni minority. On top of that, you have tribal loyalties and conflicts, and also the Kurds. But add into this mix the remnants of Saddam's administration (Ba'ath party officials and former Republican Guard members).

Then you have the gigantic fuckwad Rumsfeld who ignores everyone and says that only 150k troops are enough. Troops and commanders are sent in without any knowledge or expectation of the ground realities in Iraq vis-a-vis all those points I mentioned above (ethnic conflicts, etc.). After the dust settled, Saddam was gone but old rivalries arose.

By the time I got to Iraq in '05, the Sunni Insurgency had started. Shit was getting out of control (IED attacks in full swing, with the Sunni Insurgency starting in early '06). Many units were there to train IP (Iraqi Police) and the Military. I also talked to a few Iraqis. The general impression I got was that there were a few Iraqis who were competent to be in the police or military, but a large number of them were simply clueless. They had no military professionalism, and had no idea what to do with the arms or tactics that were being given to them. The government was a joke as well. You can't force democracy down the throats of a people who have no idea what it is in the first place. Of course, the Shia majority did nothing to endear itself to the Sunni minority; Al-Maliki is evidence of that.

The year is 2010, and the US has no good solutions at this point. People back home were getting tired of the war, and Obama made a campaign promise to bring the troops home. So he ended the war. And then we ended up with the clusterfuck that we have now. There are no good answers here, and there are no winners here. The US could have done a much-more gradual withdrawal from Iraq, with a different outcome perhaps. But Obama was under pressure to bring a decade-long war to an end and so he pulled out, quickly. The power-vacuum emboldened insurgents. Nouri Al-Maliki's deliberate alienation of Sunnis made things even worse. Now we have ISIS.

Modi is extremely correct is asking the US to not do the same thing in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a country where tribal affiliations count for more than national identity. There is no educated class; there is no upper-class or middle-class. All of those things, which existed in the 60's and 70's was gone after the Soviets showed up and fucked everything up. Then after that, of course, you have the Taliban coming to power, and then finally, the Afghan War. 

The Pak-Afghan border exists only on paper. It has more holes than a sieve and tribes don't even recognize it. Pakistan is encouraging the Taleban; it is in their interest to have a fertile breeding-ground for terrorists that they can send into India, and it gives them very good plausible-deniability as well. The US pulling out of Afghanistan really quickly is going to make that a reality for sure.

Right now, with US involvement in providing security, and Indian involvement in providing infrastructure support, we have a government that is very pro-India, much to the chagrin of Pakistan. The Afghans hate Pakistan because Pakistan encourages the Taleban. The Afghans have had enough of violence. It is in India's interest to have a friendly country on the other side of Pakistan. It puts pressure on the Pakistanis and it denies Pakistan an area from which they can plan and launch terrorist attacks against India. So in the long run, ensuring a gradual US pull-out is not only good for Afghanistan, but good for India as well. It is in both countries' interests to have a stable, functioning civilian-government with a wide reach. 

**This** is what Modi is basing his comments on. Now can you explain what is idiotic about his statement""",2014-09-30 00:47:22

&gt; In a formal letter to the President, the **bipartisan Congressional group** said, “Your meeting with [Mr.] Modi… provides an opportunity to discuss religious inclusion and the protection of religious minorities in India,” adding that the Indian Prime Minister’s visit could open a dialogue about the “positive steps his government can take in preventing oppression and encouraging religious inclusion.”

233,"&gt; Maybe the fact that the US doesn't give a fuck what our great leader thinks.

Geopolitics is not about whether country A gives a fuck about what country B thinks. It's about making a statement, that Countries C, D, E, and F can also see. It's about making it clear that India, as a country, is interested in, and wants to be involved in (this particular situation) what happens in its immediate vicinity.

I wonder why, if the ""US doesn't give a fuck what our great leader thinks"", Obama personally invited him to the US. I wonder why if the US doesn't give a fuck, defense companies are clamoring for defense contracts in India. I wonder why if the US doesn't give a fuck, companies in the US want to enter the Indian market. Money talks. India has a rising middle-class and a large market that US companies want to take advantage of. India is a rising regional power with regional aspirations, that exists in a somewhat volatile environment with two hostile-neighbors; defense companies in the US easily see an opportunity there. Perhaps your self-hating mentality would want you to consign India to be an irrelevant, underdeveloped, starving country. Or perhaps that's what you want because Modi is in power. Either way, it speaks to your lack of cognitive ability and your petty biases. But the fact is India is developing and moving ahead; albeit in fits and starts. And India has certain interests that concern her.

&gt; Or are we under the impression that they do?

See above. Your argument is useless, because unless your brain doesn't understand the concept of time, Modi is obviously commenting after the fact. He is not demanding that the US slow down their pull out. But he is making an observation that their quick pullout in Iraq was a mistake (ISIS is enough evidence of that), and it would be better for the US, for Afghanistan, for India, *and* for the current war against ISIS, that the same mistake is not repeated *in* Afghanistan.

&gt; But then, this is just theatrics for his domestic audience. We all know that.

No, this is statement made for the international stage in the grand game known as ""geopolitics"". This is a statement made taking into account the ground realities of India's security situation and what threats it can face with an anarchic Afghanistan. But understanding that would require a cognitive ability that is obviously beyond you. :)",2014-09-30 01:20:31

Besides, RS isn't the only polarizing figure. I can name another polarizing figure who was in New York that day. He had his share of detractors too. But they stayed inside a designated protest zone and held up placards and shouted slogans. On the other hand, the people in the video had gotten what they wanted... Modi as PM. He had come all the way to NY to address them. There is no justification for lashing out anymore, even if there ever was one.

I wouldn't dream of condoning what those killers did. The reference to *state apparatus* was double-edged : One, that in 2002, senior bureaucrats, intelligence and police officials were *alleged* to have conspired in both assisting in the flare-up by facilitating arousal of inflammatory passions and, subsequently, covering up the inactions of the state; Two, that the history of 1984 was readily available - for necessary prophylactic action which could have followed appropriate threat assessment based on intelligence reports provided by someone like say RB Sreekumar. However, as we have seen, 1984 has been used to 'justify' what occurred in 2002 (whataboutism). I guess the thing is that the UT authorities could do very little against the opportunism of people like Sajjan Kumar, HKL Bhagat, Jagdish Tytler, amongst others, who (I assume) did what they did to curry political favor.

&gt;You know, for 2002, I'd believed a dereliction of duty charge instead of the rabidly insane motherfuckers insisting on Modi personally ordered the chaos charge. 

I find this interesting, especially in light of the second link that I posted from Vinay Sitapati. The issue of Modi came about because of his rhetoric/stance during such time as well as Haren Pandya's deposition which was not considered. I guess those who wanted to go against Modi made a serious strategic mistake here by focussing on *his role/direct involvement* which is insulated from the actions on the ground through multiple layers. Assuming he may have been culpable in allowing the Sanghi loons freedom to wreak havoc, the best way to have gone after him would have been to work from the ground up - get those who actually murdered, raped and pillaged. Someone could have cracked and may have yielded something actionable. Or then again, it would have cleared the air against Modi once and for all. The Central Government messed up real bad by going in for what definitely seems like personal vendetta on grounds that would have been well-nigh impossible to establish in a court of law, if well covered up at the appropriate levels.

5. Insult the crowd by calling them frenzy just because they were cheering Modi. 
6. Insult the crowd by asking them if Modi paid them to cheer and behave like this.
7. Repeat 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 few more times to instigate the crowd.
8. Finally, pounce over some guy and he will retaliate.
9. Record this on camera, edit the first part and show only the 2nd part where the guy retaliates, circulate it to associated political parties who will shout at the top of their voice that Modi supporters are violent.
10. Finally, put the entire blame on Modi and ask him to apologize.

Her last campaign (incumbency campaign) in the state was fought purely on the basis of merit and without a single sop. The Maran bros to counter this offered free TV's, Grinders, Rice etc and she lost a close election. She is offering sops, but sops with a lot of merit, this term only to ensure that the fraud MK does not sneak by again.

Running the state with an asshole like MK coming into power every 5 years must be a most challenging task, he bankrupts the treasury, lets loose his family of vultures who rape the state, and to fix it every 5 years is a nightmare, but for two terms she has done it.

I would disagree with her credentials over Modi's though - he was changed around Gujarat even more than she has with TN, but one might argue that if she had got 2 consecutive terms, the situation might be different.

As long as the politics of TN revolves around cult of personality and not casteist crap (**FOR THE RECORD, BOTH ARE BAD, JUST THAT ONE IS THE LESSER EVIL**) that is North Indian politics - I am fine with that.",2014-09-30 14:08:21

350,"Heh!

I don't think *anyone* is downplaying the fact that **nothing** was done to the sikh killers. It's out there. Uncomfortable. We all know it. 30 years.

As far as downplaying this verdict is concerned, allow me to clarify that there was **no** 'verdict' that you can brandish about, since there was no occasion for a trial as the amicus curiae recommended. Not even a 'clean chit', as it has been called. Allegations were pointedly leveled at Modi with request for investigation. The SC detailed a SIT to determine if there is prosecutable evidence. Sanjiv Bhatt is of no consequence. Neither is Teesta. As I have already mentioned, they along with the CGov royally screwed up. The SIT presented a report stating that there was nothing to go on. The magistrate says OK. Those who needed this to validate their positions are happy. The man occupies the highest office of the land.

Absence of Evidence is **not** the same as Evidence of Absence. Working through critiques of the SIT's presentation as well as Modi's testimony, one finds that there is a lot that was amiss. There was incentive for cover-up. There was scope for cover-up due to polarisation and assertion of identities by all, including those supposed to serve the law and the people. And then there are larger political agendas and movements. Speaking to a strategy analyst friend of mine - he says that there are larger forces operating at levels that we do not belong. The best we can do is sip our beer.

On the flip side, we have something like this ...

[Burn After Reading](http://www.tehelka.com/burn-after-reading/)

It is investigative. It goes into detail, much like the piece I linked up there. One could argue, and probably justifiably, that it may have been politically motivated. That does not take away from **what** it says and reveals. We may not have clarity on what actually transpired at the railway platform at Godhra or subsequently at Cabin A. But we are clear that there was motivation enough for police officials to either A) serve political masters above, as it insinuates, or B) cover up their incompetence at investigation and, in doing so, willy-nilly cause the incarceration of innocents for extended periods of time. And it calls into question the judgement of the court which accorded primacy to the evidence of a, *supposedly*, manufactured witness.

This is **not** *opinion*, such like the purveyors of TV news would have us believe. It calls into question the very functioning of the SITs and so on which operate under the mandate of SC and their integrity, which is what I 'insidiously' 'insinuated' in my original post.

I don't have to believe lawyers. I'm ex-Army, having served both in the Valley (93-96) and the NE (96-97). There's a lot of stuff that happens and then there are ways in which investigations are conducted and conclusions presented. The point is - nobody questions these on points of logic and reason, as long as they satisfy a particular position/alignment/stance/agenda. It's a much bigger game.

&gt;In gujarat, 1200 odd people died with 800 and 400 of different communities. clearly not a genocide or a pogrom. So the very definition of using it goes out of the window.

I never used the words pogrom or genocide. Nor do the pieces that I have linked to.

&gt;More importantly it was state sponsered as these things are directed and done by State apparatus people.

I don't think you are very clear on what constitutes state apparatus.

**Are you for real?**

&gt;People use 1984 not to justify the killings, they use it to draw comparisions to the unfairness of using the legal machinery to go after people. There wasn't anything to go after him but they manufactured evidence. each got kneecapped in court just like Babri Masjid historians who got verbally raped by the judge.

I've already suggested that those who used legal machinery in the way that they did, messed up real bad. As for there being 'nothing to go after him' - that is a larger point and debatable, which is why the issue has been alive for some time. You have to grant something to the uncannily canny politician too, who has maintained central control of the Home Dept of his state close to his chest for the entire length of time that he has been its chief executive. 

Occam's razor - I like the fact that you bring it up. It states that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. *Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove correct, but—in the absence of certainty—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better*. This subject is murky and complex. When we are talking of justice in such a situation, summary use of the razor is not entirely tenable.

It was even worse than that. He started using weasel words first by saying ""*Some people say* that NRI's talk but don't do anything"". Then after that he drops all pretense and simply assumes that NRI's don't do anything and asks ""Why don't you do anything?"". What a prick. The crowd was pretty calm at that point and I liked that guy's answer about sending money back.

The best was watching Sardesai's stupid face when US representatives said it was a mistake to deny Modi a visa. You could see his stupid face fall and that he wasn't at all happy with it.

Second, Show me one action that Indo Americans take against america for India. I don't think there's any. 

Third, did you see the madison garden event??? the crowd went nuts yelling ""USA USA USA""!! they like USA as much as India and they want India to have a lot of the good things that USA has because you can never take out your country from yourself. 

Fourth, Indo-Americans have done a lot of good things for India. They have retained their culture and spread it in USA and adopted some american culture as well. They're the lobbyist in american govt which has immensly benefitted Indian-American relationship.. The indian diaspora in USA is huge and they're all respected.. They don't indulge in crimes, many of them are doctors and do a really nice job.. This has resulted in good opinions about India in America.. they've also spread bollywood to all parts of the world.. bollywood couldnot have been here if NRIs didn't watch bollywood movies in Cinema halls.. 

Did you see how modi got a welcome by indo americans here?? that helps big time in Indo-American relationship because of the diaspora.. 

There's something called soft power as opposed to hard power.. When you compare china and India.. China is hard power, because they have strength and military.. Soft power is country's relation with India..  India has become a major soft power compared to China because of Indian Diaspora worldwide.. 

and those people who follow sri sri ravishankar and other gurus follow them for right reasons, because they can't be fooled as they're not uneducated.. and therefore, they're probably the least confused people..

As you can see all over this thread, it's anti-modi users who are trying to conclude that since US media ignored Modi's visit, the visit wasn't important.

432,"Maybe as a 'PIO' who has been in the U.S for 30 years , I can provide a perspective. This has more to do with cultural identity than political identity. 

 Indians that have immigrated to the U.S are largely Hindus. We're also one of the newest immigrant groups. Comparatively speaking, Indians have been in the U.S for only about 10-40 years. (There are exceptions). A majority of those Indians were born outside of the United States and became naturalized citizens. Indians despite being extremely successful of all recent immigrant groups are still only 1% of the total U.S population and have largely remained below the radar for decades. We have integrated in many ways into the professional culture. But from a Hindu identity, we're still fairly isolated here from mainstream America.  Ask an average American of non-south Asian origin about Diwali and they won't know what you're talking about. But ask them about the Chinese New Year and you might actually get a response.  Even if the answer is vague.   Most white Americans can tell you were their ancestors came from in Europe. But they couldn't tell you anything beyond that. Because they've been removed from it after several generations. But ask an Indian or someone of Indian origin where his/her family originates from in India and they will most likely be able to give you a reasonable answer regarding their ancestral town or village.  My point being that we are so new despite having been here or born here, India's influence is still with us. 

So most of the fanfare you're seeing surrounding the Modi visit is largely by naturalized Indian-American crowd. But this will change in newer generations. I know when my kids grow up , I don't think they'll have that kind connection to India as I've had.  

 For a better perspective on what American born Indians think of India and Modi, visit /r/ABCDesis.  Here is an example of a question someone had posted in that sub.  [""Why I should care about about Modi or Mars Orbiter?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/2hpkvy/why_should_i_care_about_modi_or_mars_orbiter/)

Also one can have political/national allegiance to a country and yet still have a link back to their homeland.   Look at the Jews in the U.S. A large percent of them hold dual passports. One for Israel and one for the U.S. Some actually go to Israel to serve in its military.  I know several Indians kids that have signed up for military service after graduating high school or college and have proudly served in the U.S armed forces. I personally know two that were deployed in Iraq.  But yet culturally they are still involved in their local Indian communities after returning home. 

As a U.S citizen, I will fight for my adopted homeland, which is the United States. But as a Hindu, I will fight for my identity.  (Disclaimer: Has nothing to do with the Hindu religion) ",2014-10-01 04:54:49

My checkout person who is usually stand off-ish starts gushing about my Indian clothes and that the Indian ""president"" is coming to New York. Another woman from the adjacent counter also comes over and starts asking me about why Indians are so excited about Modi's election. Had a similar experience at the dentist last week.

2) Despite Point 1, PM Singh was President Obama's first foreign guest. This was huge news in America at the time. Please do remember that there was the huge red carpet reception that the Salahi's crashed. 

3). India and America are strange bedfellows. They just kind of tout the cliche worlds largest democracy/worlds biggest democracy mentality when they get together. Very little concrete stuff gets signed except for when Bush when to India and did the Civil Nuclear Deal. Point being: relatives are ""stuck/"" stagnant. 

4)  President Obama and his Secret Service are mired in scandal with all the gate jumpers. 

5) We are coming off the heels of the UN. So, the american media consumer has had enough pomp and ceremony. 

6)  President Obama is trying to court the Arab and Muslim leaders to fight ISIS. He is courting the same people and the Muslim world in the general global war on terror...it makes it awkward for Obama to have to do so with Modi in the picture.

1. Property prices going through the roof 
Why? 
A. Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar means its very easy to invest in HK without facing currency risks so all kinds of people from foreign lands can now invest there. 
B. Chinese from Mainland are being allowed to invest willy nilly.

It slowed in recent times due to a stamp duty. India simiarly under Modi has allowed the exact same shit except its done using something called REITS .

&gt;No, say officials. ""The government has only taken the powers of NPPA and kept them with it. The government will negotiate with pharma companies to keep prices low. The aim is to cut through red tapism,"" said a senior official in the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers.

&gt;Why did the govt do it, in the first place?

&gt;The government decided to empower itself to deal with the pricing of some limited and non-essential drugs. Instead of seeing this as a favour to pharmaceutical companies, it should be seen as an encouragement for them to invest and spend on R&amp;Ds.

&gt;Weren't these drugs under price control regime earlier?

&gt;The Ministry of chemicals and fertilisers had, on May 30, 2013, delegated powers to the NPPA to regulate the prices of life-saving drugs. This resulted in a significant reduction in prices of a broad spectrum of drugs. The Modi government extended this regulation to even lifesaving drugs for cancer, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma. The government later withdrew these guidelines, ahead of Modi's visit to the US.

Edit :- Also, the NPPA has only withdrawn the guidelines which were notified for controlling drug prices. 

Notification 1 (Passed on 29th May 2014) - [Internal Guidelines](http://www.nppaindia.nic.in/order/internalguidelin-29-5-14.pdf)
