**For BJP, dilemmas of victory and power of communication** 

 ______ 
As the Modi government completes three years in office , it finds itself in an enviable position . It boasts of a charismatic leader who has a committed mass following, an electoral machine that has started working extremely well, a core support base that is vociferous in its support and vicious in its attack of adversaries, an expanding footprint of influence in regions where it was historically weak, and an increasingly obedient media that directs greater scrutiny at a largely inconsequential opposition rather than at the actions of the government.But beyond all these favourable tailwinds, what is its most striking feature today is that this very positive state of affairs has come about not because of the successes of the government but because of its remarkable ability to turn its failings into its strengths. It is not that the government has no successes that it can claim, but that paradoxically its successes have added modestly to its popularity while its failures have become roaring successes. Every time it fails to deliver, somehow not only is someone else blamed but it actually derives strength from it.Take Pakistan, where the government seems to lack a coherent policy and that does not seem to matter. Pakistan continues to cross the border and kill Indian soldiers, TV studios continue to resound with anger and nationalism as an issue continues to pay the party rich dividends. Far from undermining the government's posturing, the continued violence on the border helps it keep nationalistic fires burning.It is under this government's watch that the situation in the valley has taken a sharp turn for the worse. This is in spite of being in power in the state along with its ally PDP. Kashmir's mismanagement is being attributed to the sinister agenda of anti-nationals who are sympathetic to the protestors' cause. Given that none of these protestors are in government or have any connections with the armed forces, nor are they in a position to exert the slightest influence on anything that happens on the ground or even in media, which is almost unanimous in its nationalistic avowals to blame them for what is happening in Kashmir, this is ridiculous. And for the government to escape any responsibility is even more remarkable.The Naxal problem follows a similar pattern. It is shocking that successive governments have allowed our para-military forces to become fodder for the Naxals. They are poorly equipped, ill-prepared and often have to follow mixed signals from their political superiors. Again the state's ineptness has resulted not in its coming under pressure, but in ire being directed towards 'anti-national' student leaders in JNU, as if they are somehow directly responsible for the Naxal situation.In all these cases, what seems to matter is the ability to harvest anger at the expense of people who can be aggressively blamed. This is the government's great insight — what we really need is something to be angry about, and preferably the object of our anger should be far removed from where we are so that we can keep raging about it without having the slightest need to do anything about it. The distant, the symbolic, the weak made to appear menacing — these are ideal enemies to focus our anger on.Nothing illustrates the government's ability to make a bad call look really good than the demonetisation gambit. Far from suffering on account of demonetisation, as UP has made evident, the party has derived enormous political mileage out of it. When the best thing that is being said about demonetisation is that it did no lasting damage, the fact the government is not being held responsible even by the media is quite remarkable.The speed with which the controversial choice of Yogi Adityanath has been normalised indicates how much the party is in control of its narrative. The presumptive approval that has been generated in favour of Yogi Adityanath so early in his rule is proof of the power of communication rather than performance.When the Modi government completed two years, the biggest question that was asked was whether it was being able to fulfill the tremendous expectations it had raised about the imminent arrival of acche din. Today, somehow that question is no longer relevant. Post the UP elections, there is an air of inevitable permanence about the BJP government and that seems to put new policy initiatives on the back burner.Now that BJP has power, the question it has to ask itself is what does it intend to use this power for? Does it back the logic of the current strategy till 2019 and hope to look at a more aggressive developmental agenda thereafter? Does it at some stage, move beyond the manufacture and recirculation of anger towards a larger and more inclusive destination? Even if it were to get more committed to its Hindutva project, will it ever move beyond thinly veiled attempts to lash out at other religious minorities and build a more inspiring and future-facing destination for itself? Or is this all that we can expect from it? More corrosive anger, more manufactured negativity, sharper divisiveness, and — more comprehensive victories?santosh365@gmail.com

**3 years on, Modi remains people’s PM but key issues remain unaddressed: Survey** 

 ______ 
Three out of five Indians are satisfied with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s performance though a majority feels his government is sliding on checking prices, generating jobs and preventing crime, an online poll has found.

Tuesday marks three years of the BJP-led NDA storming to power at the Centre. The Modi government, in these years, either met or exceeded expectations of 61% of the people surveyed while 59% felt it was on track to fulfil pre-poll promises, says a survey by LocalCircles.

More than 40,000 respondents in around 200 cities participated in the exercise conducted by the online citizen engagement platform.

Modi’s political capital has largely remained intact even though his government has not done enough to create jobs, check inflation, improve healthcare and prevent crime against women and children.

Of the missions the government has launched, direct benefit transfer got the highest approval (47%) and Make in India the lowest (8%).

Modi’s signature Clean India campaign seems to fail to impress as 57% of the people responded in negative when asked if their cities were cleaner.

The areas in which the Modi government scored high were foreign policy, especially vis-à-vis Pakistan, its handling communalism, infrastructure development and performance in Parliament in terms of delivery on key bills.

While 81% respondents felt that India’s image and influence in the world had improved, 64% approved of the handling of Pakistan, a significant increase from last year when the figure stood at 34%.

About 51% said demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes was successful in cracking down on black money. But only 37% agreed that scrapping of the high-value notes had reduced corruption.

The contradiction reinforces the goodwill the PM continues to enjoy despite poor rating of his government’s schemes that have a bearing on daily life.

People have a grim view of parliamentarians, with 69% citizens saying their elected MPs did not address problem of their constituencies.

This was the third annual survey of the government’s performance by LocalCircles. Compared to last year, there was a marginal fall in the percentage of people who felt the government met their expectations — from 46% to 44% — while dissatisfaction rose by 3% to 36%.

“Overall, as change hasn’t come fast enough for most people, there is a decline in citizens’ rating of the government in most areas compared to last year,” stated LocalCircles.

Only 28% of the citizens said the prices of essential commodities came down as against 38% last year. “This means there is a difference between citizens’ perception and official inflation indicators,” the survey agency said.

**Suspected Pakistani, Chinese hackers target Indian Army officers computers** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Hackers target computers of Indian Army officers.

2 Hackers sent malware-ridden emails promises officers postings in Sri Lanka.

3 Hackers suspected to be Pakistani and Chinese.

In a massive cyberattack, suspected Pakistani and Chinese hackers attempted to hack into the computers of Indian Army officers by trying to inject data stealing malware by luring them with offers of a foreign posting to Sri Lanka.

""The pinpointed attacks were launched on Friday by the hackers to middle-rung Indian Army officers by sending them an email purportedly sent from a government server and asking them to avail the offer of going for a posting to attend a prestigious course in a Sri Lankan military academy,"" Army sources told Mail Today.

The sender of the mail was nicknamed ADGMT-16. The mail was made to look as if it had been sent by Indian Army's Directorate General of Military Training, which details officers and personnel for attending courses within and outside India along with the Military Secretary's branch, the sources said.

ARMY CYBER GROUP ISSUES ALERT

Soon after, the first few officers who received the malicious mail referred it to the Army Cyber Group, which issued an immediate alert to caution the officers against opening the mail.

The Army Cyber Group in its warning, said, ""A malicious email from *karmicc16@nic.in* is being sent to Army personnel. The email contains a malicious file 'DEPUTATION_OF_ONE_ARM Y_OFFICER_TO_ATTEND_SRI_ LANKA. Xls'. On opening the malicious file, a data stealing malware gets installed in the computer. Please do not open the email,"" said.

Hackers often use links of dubious websites to inject malware in their victim's system. These malware are designed to disrupt or damage or gain unauthorised access to a computer, and may steal critical information.

Incidentally, the hackers tried to attack Indian Army officers with offers of Sri Lanka posting at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Colombo for a two-day visit.

ATTACKS BEING PROBED

Both the Army Cyber Group and the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-India) are trying to ascertain the source of the attacks. They suspect it to be the job of Chinese and Pakistani hackers as they have been using similar tactics in the past as well.

Sources said the first few officers who received the mail got suspicious as soon as they received it as the Army does not offer or announce postings of officers on private mailbox and communicates only on its intranet.

In the last couple of months, this is the second massive attack on the Indian Army officers in a bid to steal classified information from their personal emails which could be used in many ways including blackmailing the victims or using the stolen data for anti-Indian activities, sources said.

In April, the Army Cyber Group had uncovered a coordinated attempt to hack into the computers of its senior officers with decoy emails that purportedly contained links of ""their sex videos"". At least four officers of Lieutenant General-rank posted at South Block headquarters were the target of the malicious bid.

The nationality of the hackers in the April attack has not yet been ascertained but the Army unit traced the server and the Internet Protocol address to Germany.

After a few incidents of virtual honey-trapping by Pakistani agents, the Army has been on an overdrive to educate its personnel to guard against such attacks. One example of this is evident in calling an official Army telephone number, which plays a recorded message about the need to be careful from foreign agents who have been trying to extract information by all means.

26,"&gt; veiled reference to him

If you wanted a debate/label-accusation, you could have just asked rather than unveil the reference thus defeating the purpose of that said veil.  

All of your points (those of the linked article of this post)have been explained over the previous weeks and months. They hold no credible water.  

I won't be going in extreme details here. So this will be a relatively brief comment.  

India's objection to CPEC and OBOR is to put it bluntly, Childish.  
India didn't object like this when the Karakoram Highway got build (the current route is just doing expansion work and the like on and around it). 
There was no such objection when 2005 post Earthquake work was going on in parts of Azad Kashmir(which is also POK according to India).  
There was/is no Indian outrage over the Neelum–Jhelum Dam being build.  
All of these had China working in one capacity or another.   

_____________

About Chinese intentions.  
Of course its about National Interests. Who came up with the fantastical idea this was some altruistic endeavor by China?  

**BUT** what people who object to such things do not get is, not all systems are Zero-Sum. Some are but there is no need for all to be as such.  
And there is no indication or proof that OBOR is Zero Sum.  

The mechanism through which China is trying to enhance its National Interest is by helping elevate metrics which other countries need. There is no dichotomy here.  

Furthermore, TOI even went so far to say this was Colonialism by Chinese. The preposterousness of that is mind boggling.  
Using similar rhetoric a similar argument(equally ridiculous in essence) can be for Indian activities in South Asia.  

________________

Additionally, the point which totally exposes the Indian position as what i called in the [last comment i made on this matter](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6avkdk/nepal_too_joins_obor_china_experts_say_india_must/dhhz0gt/), i.e. dictionary definition of *Literally Stupid*.   

Here is why.  

India is ALREADY working on the North South Corridor with Russia and Iran. Its 2 decades old. Decades before anyone in China even thought up this Interlinking equation in Eurasia.  
Probably the only country who have held the same basic idea/hope about this matter would be Kazakhstan. After that India has for decades wanted what OBOR is trying to do in Eurasia.  
Its strategic reason No 1 why India is so hell bent on keeping J&amp;K despite it being a net loss making exercise for India.  
Its because India desires link to Central Asia-Russia and beyond and its so because its strategic planners understand the fundamental paradigm of Eurasia. Who so ever dominates Eurasia dominates the planet and whosoever doesn't dominate Central Asia CAN NOT dominate Eurasia.  
India has long understood this.  

Indian objection to OBOR was political in nature, because no competent strategic theorist would urge such an action because its as mention, patently Stupid.  

Esp in light of what is mentioned and happening.  

That Chabahar deal India is doing, its part of that North South Corridor. How long has India wanted a direct pipeline from there to India?  

Then there is the Trilateral Highway in East through Myanmar.   

India is ALREADY part of the process. Its already making such projects, just the scale is small. Hence Indian objection are null and void and they are lacking even political consistency.  

India is now supposed to develop the North Sri Lankan Trincomalee port. Thereby undercutting Indian East Cost port infra (given that all India ports needs serious investment). Its setting up competition for itself. And it was recently concluded when PM Modi went to SL and in all likelihood India took this on because otherwise it would have been handed over to China by SL, in a Hambantota v2.0 equation where India was offered the development work but India refused, mostly on account of lack of capability/capacity(combined with the arrogant assumption SL will never go against Indian wishes and stay underdeveloped as per Indian wishes and capabilities) NOT because India was adhering to some anti-colonial, prudent Debt policies, etc.   

SL is not getting average infra. Its getting Elite World Class infra. That is not cheap, it comes at a cost and the SL (INCLUDING the so called anti-China new Govt) accepted this willingly, multiple times.  
____

Lastly.  

*Keep your friends close and your enemies closer*.  
This is not some 4chan originated quote made for trolling or some EdgyQuotes website.   
Its a very old adage because its build on from practical experiences of multiple groups of people all over the world.  

**India by not being at the Table is weaker because it doesn't know what is going on**.  

The EU refused to agree to certain terms in the joint declaration. YET they still went and took part because they wanted to see what is going on. It gives them strategic flexibility because they are part of the process. This is how adults behave. They didn't bow to China and still maintained their Independence.  
(Though part of the reason why they could do so was also because Infra development is not in Europe, its on their doors so they can afford to be more strict in their demands because they have nothing to lose.). 
But the principle still stands for India.  

Secondly, OBOR is NOT a bank like AIIB (which US boycotted on various grounds like the colonial BS rhetoric) yet India is the 2nd most important country in that and its share and impact is going to increase over the coming years and decades in it, this is enshrined in the framework of the deal. Yet even US and Japan sent their delegates to this OBOR forum. So much for argument consistency.   
Neither is OBOR a single project in a single location. 

Its a networking initiative. Its started by China but it is neither the first to proclaim its essence neither will it be the bulk spender on it and nor will it be the sole beneficiary of it.  

These are the facts. 

Furthermore, China can not be allowed a free reign to dominate this venture and frame it in its own image and India's actions only try to do this exact thing by isolating itself.  
You can't bring change(whatever that is) when you are standing outside. And no one likes a whiner.  

And its my prediction India WILL be participating in ventures which are part of OBOR in coming years and decades under the same dispute and economic conditions which exist and which India objected to in its farcical MEA statement.  
Farcical because, practically the whole world barring India was there.

**'We Will Be There,' Mamata Banerjee Tweets Lalu Yadav Amid Tax Raids** 

 ______ 
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met Congress president Sonia Gandhi
today

**New Delhi: **

Just before she walked in for a 5 pm appointment with Congress president Sonia
Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sent a warm tweet of
support today to Bihar politician Lalu Yadav, accused of proxy land deals
worth Rs 1000 crore by Income Tax officials, who searched almost 20 locations
in Delhi and Gurgaon today in the case.

Mamata Banerjee's tweet was in response to Lalu Yadav's post from two days
ago, when he had alleged a conspiracy to jail him to ensure that he cannot
hold a mega rally he has announced in August to bring together parties to take
on the ruling BJP.

""Lalu Ji we accepted your invitation to be there on Aug 27. We will be there,""
Ms Banerjee tweeted on Tuesday evening.

Lalu Yadav, 68, had said, ""BJP says dey wil jail me asap so our proposed 27th
Aug Maha-Rally can't tk place.Haha.My name is Lalu &amp;amp; I pity 4 such
intimidators (sic).""

As the raids were conducted, he tweeted

in Hindi today, ""The BJP does not have the courage to stifle my voice...If it
tries to silence one Lalu, crores of Lalu will come forward,"" also adding,
""Our alliance is unbreakable.""

The BJP, which is the chief opposition party in Bihar, has been releasing
documents that it alleges proves Lalu Yadav used his earlier posts of Chief
Minister of Bihar and Union Railways Minister for corrupt land deals in Patna,
Delhi and other places.

Lalu Yadav's RJD is a partner in the government of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish
Kumar, who has said that if the BJP or central government have evidence of his
ally's corruption, they should take action.

Rivals for years, Mr Kumar and Mr Yadav joined hands in the last Bihar
assembly elections along with the Congress in what was called a Grand Alliance
to defeat the BJP, in a partnership that since seen some turbulence.

Both Bihar leaders are currently engaged in efforts to unite opposition
parties for discussions on fielding a common candidate for President. It is
seen as test case for a Bihar-like alliance of multiple opposition parties for
the national election in 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek re-
election.

Ms Banerjee met Sonia Gandhi this evening

to discuss possible candidates and said, ""no names have been discussed."" The
Bengal chief minister has also accused the BJP of using central agencies to
settle political scores and said today, ""Political battles should be fought
politically; They don't like someone, they throw charges at them, they get
them raided, they jail them."" Ms Banerjee said.

Mr Yadav had announced his August 17 rally planned in Bihar capital Patna,
designed as a show of strength by anti-BJP parties, earlier this month.

**Centre plans to provide jobs to one crore people in next two years** 

 ______ 
Bengaluru: The government intends to provide employment to one crore people in the country in the next two years, union minister Bandaru Dattatreya said on Tuesday. The union minister of state for labour and employment also noted that the government’s skill development initiative has contributed towards creating a skilled work force in the country.

“Employer-employee relationship has been cordial after the Narendra Modi-led government came to power, so I am fully confident that we will provide one crore people with employment in the next two years,” he said after inaugurating the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Nursing College and Auditorium in Bengaluru. Union minister for chemical and fertilisers Ananth Kumar and member of Parliament P.C. Mohan were present at the event. Speaking about the various “positive” legislations brought in by the department after the NDA government came to power, Dattatreya expressed hope that the new wage and industrial relations codes will be passed in Parliament’s next session.

“I am confident that we will bring this wage, industrial relation codes to the parliament in the next session and get it passed. It will benefit labourers and the working class,” the minister said. He said there were 44 central labor laws. “We are going amalgamate all these labour laws and rationalise it into four labor codes—wages, industrial relations, social security and safety, health and working conditions,” the minister said. He also announced that a 200-bed ESI hospital will be set up at Bommasandra in Bengaluru at a cost of Rs150 crore, and 100-bed hospitals will be set up in Shivamogga, Narasapura, Harohalli and Ballari.

The 50-bed hospitals at Hubballi and Davangere will be upgraded to 100 beds, Dattatreya said. Ananth Kumar said the ministry for chemicals, fertilisers and pharmaceuticals would sign a MoU in 15 days with the labor ministry to have the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra at hospitals run by it, in order to provide affordable generic medicines.

**UP legislature passes GST Bill** 

 ______ 
(Eds: Rpting after dropping two lines in intro)

Lucknow, May 16 (PTI) The Uttar Pradesh legislature today unanimously passed the UP Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017.

It being a money bill, the proposed legislation was returned by voice vote by the legislative council hours after the state assembly approved it unanimously.

The current session of the UP Assembly was convened especially for the introduction and passage of the GST Bill.

With both Houses of the state legislature clearing the measure, Uttar Pradesh has joined the likes of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Telangana, Bihar and Rajasthan whose legislatures have given their nod to the indirect tax regime.

The bill, which was yesterday tabled in the Vidhan Sabha, was today passed unanimously through a voice vote with the Opposition not pressing for sending it to the select committee.

Initiating the discussion on the bill, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath termed it as revolutionary move which is in the interest of both consumers and traders.

""The GST Bill is the result of the Modi governments move towards wider economic reforms,"" he said, adding that it will bring uniformity in the tax structure.

Participating in the debate, Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary suggested sending the bill to the select committee for wider scrutiny.

Nitin Agarwal and Sanjay Garg (SP), Uma Shankar Singh (BSP) and Ajay Kumar Laloo (Congress) raised doubts over certain provisions in the measure and demanded that small traders be exempted from it. However, they were all in favour of the bill.

Members of the opposition parties said that filing of returns online three times a month would be cumbersome and suggested monetary fine in place of jail term for those who do not comply with it.

In his reply, the chief minister allayed their fears, giving a point-by-point clarification.

""The doubts of the members over lack of computer knowledge has been taken care of ... It will benefit small traders,"" he said, adding that the Centre will compensate for the loss of revenue to states with the GST coming into effect.

""There is no need to be afraid of the GST ... All non-BJP ruled states have also passed it. For redressing their problems, the GST council is going to hold a meeting soon,"" the chief minister told both the Legislative Assembly and the Council.

Chaudhary said there had been some doubts over the bill which had kept it pending for so long but after Adityanath said there was no need to worry, the bill was passed unanimously.

The state government is confident that its tax revenue would increase due to the GST, which is touted as the most liberal tax structure to be adopted in the country.

Four key GST legislations -- the Central GST Act, the Integrated GST Act, the GST (Compensation to States) Act and the Union Territory GST Act -- were passed by Parliament in its last session.

The four legislations have since got the presidents assent.

Seen as a path-breaking step in the taxation regime, the GST is expected to create a congenial and cohesive atmosphere for business in the country.

Different indirect taxes like the central excise duty, central sales tax and service tax are to be merged with the C-GST, while the S-GST will subsume state sales tax, VAT, luxury tax and entertainment tax.

The consumer state of Uttar Pradesh is projected to be a net tax gainer under the new tax regime as the GST is a destination-based taxation system as against manufacturing source based.

The state Commercial Tax Department had been holding consultative meetings for several months with all stakeholders, including traders and tax experts, to elicit their views on the new tax structure. PTI NAV SAB SMI GVS

**Sri Lanka backs India's concern over Kashmir in China's OBOR project** 

 ______ 
BEIJING: Sri Lanka , which attended the just concluded Belt and Road Forum here, has backed India's concern over the Kashmir issue, saying it is difficult for New Delhi to accept the USD 50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it goes through the ""heart of Indian interests"".India, which skipped the high-profile meeting, would have joined ""very happily"" in the One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative of China , said Sarath Amanugama, Sri Lanka's Minister on Special Assignment.""Unfortunately, the issue is going through the heart of Indian interests. If it is some uncontested region, India would have negotiated its way out. Here especially the Kashmir issue getting dragged into it, makes it difficult for India to be flexible,"" Amanugama, who accompanied Lankan Prime Minister Wickramasinghe to the two-day forum here, told PTI here.He said India, China and Sri Lanka were very much part of the ancient Silk Road route as the Chinese Buddhist scholars like Faxian visited both India and Sri Lanka leading to big discoveries of Buddhist relics in the island nation.""(Chinese) President Xi Jinping has emphasised connectivity. These countries were connected many centuries ago. This will link up these countries on certain rational basis. Once the regional problems are resolved, then India has to play big role in the initiative,"" he said, adding that . India anyway has to play big role ""because you cannot think of a belt and road without going over and close to India.""India skipped the meeting due to its sovereignty concerns over the USD 50 billion CPEC, which goes through Pakistan- occupied Kashmir. The two-day conference in Beijing brought together leaders from 29 countries.Besides Wickramasinghe, the summit was attended by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and several other leaders, heads of UN, World Bank and IMF.Wickaramasinghe, who arrived here a day after he hosted Prime Minister Narandra Modi in Sri Lanka, had a low-key presence at the high-profile summit.While Sharif and many other leaders spoke at the inaugural ceremony, the Sri Lankan leader reportedly took part in the discussions in the roundtable meeting yesterday.Amunagama said that Sri Lanka will not permit any foreign military operations in its port by any country including China, in an effort to reassure India's security concerns over Chinese military activity.Confirming reports that recent Chinese requests for docking of its submarines was declined, he said, ""we denied the permission.""""Lanka's position is that our harbours and ports are for commercial operations. All other countries have no strategic interests. We are equidistant from everyone,"" he said.Earlier, the problem came because a Chinese submarine was allowed to be docked in Colombo harbour by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2014 which sparked protests from India.""China, India, US and all other countries, they cannot come into our territorial waters without the consent of the Sri Lankan government,"" Amanugama said.Even the Hambantota harbour which Sri Lanka plans to hand over to China under debt equity scheme will function under Sri Lankan Port Authority (SLPA).He said in the agreement currently being finalised to give 80 per cent stake for Chinese shipping company, it will be allowed to operate inside the harbour but all the outside operations will be carried out SLPA.The harbour master who permits the ship movement in the harbour will be an SAPA employee, he said.Allaying India's concerns, he said Sri Lanka is taking assistance from the Indian Navy to maintain maritime security including tracking submarines.India is also providing patrol boats, he said.""But we had an extended debt. Sri Lanka is facing a problem of debt repayment,"" he said, defending Sri Lanka opting for debt swap for harbour.Sri Lanka has an estimated debt of USD eight billion to China. The loans were taken for different mega projects.""So last year we raised it with Premier Li Keqiang. At first we asked for a debt relief, either to write it off or to reschedule payment. But the Premier said it is not possible because they have lent money to several other countries. We cannot write it off to create precedent,"" he said.""But suggested why don't you convert into equity by forming a joint venture company. It will be registered in Sri Lanka and will be Sri Lankan company. Chinse side will convert that into equity. Sri Lanka doesn't have to repay,"" he said, adding that it was a ""win win situation"".

**India asserts support to Palestine ahead of Narendra Modi’s Israel visit** 

 ______

New Delhi: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stand-alone visit to Israel—the first ever by an Indian prime minister to the Jewish state since the establishment of diplomatic relations 25 years ago—scheduled for July, India on Tuesday underlined its position as a committed development partner of Palestine and conveyed its “unwavering” support for the Palestinian cause.

The two sides also signed five pacts to boost cooperation in information technology (IT), health and agriculture, among other areas.

Speaking after talks with visiting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in New Delhi, Modi said: “India has been unwavering in its support of the Palestinian cause. And we hope to see the realization of a sovereign, independent, united and viable Palestine, coexisting peacefully with Israel.”

Once seen as standing firmly for an independent state of Palestine and shunning diplomatic relations with the Jewish state, the Indian government established diplomatic relations with Israel in January 1992.

This was in the aftermath of the US and then Soviet Union co-hosting the Madrid conference with Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinians in October 1991. The conference created a long-missing framework for talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, though the meeting itself did not lead to any results.

India-Israel ties have in the meantime soared with the two nations working closely in areas like defence, IT, agriculture, water conservation and recycling. Besides Modi visiting Israel in July, there are hopes of a visit to India by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the close of the 25th anniversary year celebrations in January 2018.

Modi’s visit to Israel is aimed at qualitatively elevating ties to a new level. And Abbas’s visit—ahead of the Israel trip—is seen as India doing its balancing act, though in a new manner.

In his remarks, Modi said he and Abbas had agreed that “the challenges in West Asia must be addressed through sustained political dialogue and peaceful means”.

On ties with Palestine, Modi said: “India is committed to be a useful development partner of Palestine...We will continue to support the development and capacity-building efforts of Palestine. The agreements concluded today are a reaffirmation of our intent to strengthen cooperation in this direction. We have also taken up for particular emphasis the areas of IT, youth and skills development in the assistance provided by India.”

Abbas described India as a “friendly country” and “an ideal nation” that had achieved progress in technology and economy.

“India is a friend. It has influence at the international level. India can play an important role (in the resolving the Palestine-Israel crisis,” he said.

**Kolkata imam Barkati’s term may be terminated tomorrow: Mosque board head** 

 ______ 
Syed Noor ur Rahman Barkati, the controversial Islamic cleric from Bengal who recently threatened jihad in India, will be sacked as head of Kolkata’s Tipu Sultan mosque.

“He is a blot on our community,” Shahezada Anwar Ali Shah, the head of the mosque’s trustee board, said on Tuesday while confirming that Barkati’s sacking will likely be announced on Wednesday evening.

Barkati headed the mosque for 28 years.

He fell out of favour with Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, one of his strongest backers once, last week after he warned of a ‘jihad’ if India was declared a Hindu state and also refused to take off the red beacon from his car.

Read: Kolkata’s maverick imam Barkati finally removes red beacon from his car

“We are at the final stage of discussion with our advocates. The announcement of his termination may be made at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Through his anti-national comments he has done disservice to the nation and the community, and we feel that he has no right to continue as imam of the mosque,” Shah said.

Barkati also grabbed headlines in January when he issued a fatwa against the Prime Minister over the November decision to ban high-value currency notes.

He had then been given police protection by the state government.

But the relation soured last week after Barkati’s jihad comments. Banerjee sent on May 13 urban development minister Firhad Hakim to chastise him.

On the same day the library minister in her cabinet, Siddiqullah Chowdhury, also held an agitation against the imam outside his mosque and called him an RSS agent.

Echoing the library minister, Shah said on Tuesday that Barkati encouraged fundamentalist forces like RSS through his anti-national comments.

He said the mosque received a flood of complaints against Barkati, prominent among which is the false claim of a shahi imam.

Read: Police complaint against Kolkata’s ‘fatwa imam’ Barkati for not giving up red beacon

According to Shah, a shahi imam is one who administers namaaz to the royal families, or is appointed by a royal family. “Barkati is the second generation imam from his family after his father. He took over the charge as the Imam in 1989,” he said.

If Barkati is finally removed on Wednesday, it will bring down curtains on the term of one of the most controversial clerics of the country. He regularly attracted attention for issuing fatwas against a number of persons including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin and Canadian columnist Tarek Fateh.

Read: Muslim clerics in Bengal demand ban on RSS, say Ram Navami processions with weapons illegal

The trustee board chief also said that a police complaint has been filed against Barkati for forcefully snatching away the keys of the rooms of the mosques including the record room.

There are also complaints against Barkati for misusing the mosque complex for press conferences and running personal businesses like conducting marriages.

The imam also faced police complaints for his ‘anti-national’ remarks on May 9 when he took on both the Union government and the judiciary in front of TV cameras.

In another development on Monday, Farah Khan, wife of Nadimul Haque, Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha member and executive editor of Urdu daily, Akhbar- E- Mashriq filed a police complaint saying that on May 15 (Monday) a group of about 30 men armed with deadly weapons entered their home and office “shouting and abusing me and my husband and threatening our office staff of dire consequences if our newspaper keeps reporting against Noorur Rehman Barkai.

**Not scared, will continue to fight racist forces: Lalu** 

 ______ 
PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad put up a brave face amid reports of Income Tax raids on 22 Delhi-NCR locations in connection with benami land deals worth Rs 1,000 crore linked to him and his family. “I am not scared at all... I will continue to fight against fascist forces,” he said in a series of tweets, showing no signs of nervousness.Lalu’s first tweet in fact fuelled speculations over the fate of Bihar’s ruling grand alliance of RJD, JD (U) and Congress. “BJP ko naye alliance partners mubarak ho. Main jhukne aur darnewala nahi hoon,” he tweeted.The reaction appeared to express Lalu’s indignation as the raids had come only a day after CM Nitish Kumar’s statement that the alleged benami deals of Lalu’s family were out of the state government’s purview, hinting the Centre should act against him if the allegations had merit.However, Lalu soon took a U-turn and clarified in another tweet that the alliance was intact and the BJP should not feel good. “Gathbandhan atoot hai. Abhi to samaan vichardhara ke aur dalon ko sath jodna hai (Our alliance is strong. We have to bring other like-minded parties under one umbrella),” read the second tweet.RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha also clarified on Lalu’s “new alliance” jibe, saying the RJD chief referred to central government’s agencies including I-T department and Enforcement Directorate.“The BJP is using the I-T department and other central agencies as its alliance partners against the opposition, including the RJD,” Jha said at a presser at the RJD state HQ in Patna in the afternoon.Lalu started tweeting soon after the news of raids started flashing on TV screens around 11am. In his second tweet, Lalu stated: “BJP mein himmat nahi hai ki Lalu ki awaaz ko daba sake... Lalu ki awaaz dabayenge to desh bhar mein karoron Lalu khare ho jayenge... Main gidarbhabhki se nahi darne wala hoon (BJP does not have the guts to stifle my voice... If it tries to silence Lalu’s voice, crores of Lalu would come up all across the country. I am not scared of empty threats).”Meanwhile, a number of RJD functionaries visited Lalu’s 10, Circular Road residence soon after the news of raids broke. “It is a political raid. BJP functionary Sushil Modi levelled allegations against Lalu family and RJD levelled allegations against Modi. However, action has been taken only against Lalu, which shows PM Narendra Modi is scared of Lalu,” said former MP Prabhunath Singh.Though there were apprehensions that Lalu’s sons deputy CM Tejahswi Prasad and forest and health minister Tej Pratap might skip the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, they did attend the meeting. None of them, however, spoke to the media.The RJD chief slammed the media, describing them as “illiterate” and asking them to enumerate the 22 “raided” locations. “Arre padhe-likhe anpadhon, yeh toh batao ki kaun se 22 thikano par chhapemari hui... BJP-samarthit media aur uske sahyogi ghatakon (sarkari toton) se Lalu nahi darta (You learned illiterates, please disclose the 22 locations which are being raided... Lalu does not fear the BJP-backed media and central agencies (state-owned parrots),” Lalu said in one of his tweets.

Yes I know some of you anti-national randians are already jizzing your pants to point  out that banning petrol/diesel cars doesn't result in us going ""fossil fuel less."" because other trucks, buses, vans  and motorcycles and scooters still use fossil fuels , that's why Jaitley-ji will call a press conference and clarify that what Modi-ji really meant was moving towards a ""less fossil fuel"" society.


After the announcement, For 48 hrs there won't be any new cars anywhere but after that all car companies will setup exchange centres and in less than 50 days all cars in the country will be electric. (There will be limits on how many cars each person can exchange to ensure that rich black money hoarders don't hoard all the shiny new electric cars.)

To ensure faster exchange process, there'll only be two models of electric cars and only one colour each, one gray-green 500cc equivalent electric hatchback and one pink-purple 2000cc equivalent SUV-style vehicle.

Those who want other colours can wait for a few months for new models and colours to become available. 

This will achieve multiple critical objectives. 

- The rich black money hoarders who bought expensive cars will now be left with nothing but scrap metal.
- The drop in demand for petrol/diesel will reduce the demand for forex and boost the value of the rupee.
- The drop in imports will result in less money going to islamic countries in the middle east to be able to fund the spread of islamic terror in India.
- And with petrol bunks going out of style and all state electricity boards only supplying power to those with Aadhaar numbers. The world will be an infinitely better place.

&gt;Is that about right?

If you believe that in the philosophy of ""For the greater good"", then should you not agree that the adivasis in Naxal areas should also be forcibly resettles so that the govt can start mass mining in these states and thereby benefit the Indian economy helping everyone?

**On Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's visit, PM Modi says India supports Palestine cause** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India sought to elevate its ties with Palestine during the ongoing visit of President Mahmoud Abbas by reinforcing its principled stand on a two-state solution and offering a slew capacity building projects in what would reflect the central government’s classic diplomatic balancing act ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Israel trip in July.The two decided to strengthen cooperation enabling sharing of information and perspectives to fight international terror as Abbas and Modi held wide ranging discussions on the volatile situation in West Asia.The two sides agreed that the challenges in West Asia must be addressed through sustained political dialogue and peaceful means, including in Syria.In what came as reassurance to Abbas was Modi's remarks on creation of a sovereign Palestine notwithstanding growing bonhomie between Delhi and Tel Aviv.""The relationship between India and Palestine is built on the foundation of long-standing solidarity and friendship since the days of our own freedom struggle. India has been unwavering in its support of the Palestinian cause. And we hope to see the realisation of a sovereign, independent, united and viable Palestine, co-existing peacefully with Israel. I have reaffirmed our position on this to President Abbas during our conversation today,"" Modi said in his remarks to the press with Abbas by his side following their dialogue.The PM also hoped for early resumption of talks between Palestinian and Israeli sides to move towards finding a comprehensive solution.It may be recalled that India's ties with Israel expanded simultaneously with expansion of its partnership with Arab World during the past two decades. It is understood that during his trip to Israel, Modi and the leadership there will discuss on the issue of negiations between Palestinians and Israelis for a lasting solution to the protracted crisis.Delhi is not yet a mediator in many of the conflicts in West Asia but hopes to expand its footprints across the region, which is in its extended neighbourhood. India also participated in a conference on Israel and Palestine organised by France in Paris earlier this year.Abbas in his remarks at the joint press meet described India as a ""dost"" which supported cause at all international fora and condemned terror in all its forms and manifestations.He empahsised that India is at the forefront of reconstruction of Palestine.This is Abbas’ maiden trip to India under the current NDA regime and Delhi hopes to have Palestine as a partner in the volatile region where it has vital human, energy and security interests. Contrary to initial perception, the Modi-led government has had a sustained engagement with Palestine, including a visit by President Pranab Mukherjee in 2015, holding the first ever Joint Commission last year and extending grants for development and capacity building projects.This was once again reflected during Abbas-Modi talks. ""India is committed to be a useful development partner of Palestine. President Abbas and I agreed that both sides, through practical cooperation, will work together to build Palestine’s economy and contribute to improving the lives of its people. We will continue to support the development and capacity-building efforts of Palestine,"" Modi stated at the joint press meet.The two sides also signed five pacts, including cooperation in health, IT, agriculture and youth affairs. India is undertaking project assistance for a flagship Techno-park project in Ramallah. Once completed, it will serve as an IT hub in Palestine offering a one-stop solution for all ITrelated training and services.The PM also hoped that large number of Palestinians will participate in international day of yoga next month. The visit by the Palestinian president after his trips to the US and Russia also enabled Delhi to get an understanding of Abbas’ engagements with global powers on the Israeli-Palestine issue.The recent meet of the Arab leaders in Amman called for ""creation of a Palestinian state under a two-state solution that would be the basis of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal"". Furthering strategic ties with West Asia has been a priority for the BJP-led NDA government.

**Raids on Lalu Prasad, Chidambaram rile Opposition; ensuring accountability says the Government** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A string of raids and searches by central government agencies on Tuesday on the families of Congress leader P Chidambaram and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad set off a major political storm with the GOP alleging “vendetta politics” while Bharatiya Janata Party said the government was simply ensuring “accountability of the corrupt”.The raids, which came on the third anniversary of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance’s thumping victory in Lok Sabha elections, led Chidambaram to allege that he was being targeted for his criticism of the Narendra Modi government.The Central Bureau of Investigation has named the former finance minister’s son Karti Chidambaram in an FIR alleging criminal conspiracy and cheating to influence public officials, in this case finance ministry officials, to “scuttle” an investigation into INX Media Private Ltd (now called 9X Media). This includes charges of gratifying the officials to settle the matter “amicably”. CBI has also charged the directors of INX Media at the time, Pratim alias Peter Mukerjea and his wife Indrani Mukerjea , who are currently in custody for their alleged involvement in the murder of Indrani’s daughter Sheena Bora Chidambaram dismissed the allegations, saying that while there were no charges against him, his son was being made a political target. “Every case was processed according to law and approval was granted or refused in accordance with the recommendations of FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) consisting of five secretaries. The government, using CBI and other agencies, is targeting my son and his friends.”Lalu Prasad, who has come under repeated attacks by BJP in the past week for alleged property deals worth Rs 1,000 crore by his daughter Misa and two sons, hit back after income-tax authorities carried out searches at 22 places in Delhi and Gurgaon.Without getting into the details, FM Arun Jaitley said people in high positions acquiring assets through shell companies is not a small matter and they would be held accountable.The FM backed the agencies, saying they do not take action unless they have substantial basis to suspect there was evasion or a crime had been committed.Power minister Piyush Goyal was more specific about Chidambaram’s remarks and took a dig at him. “No one cares about those columns (criticising the government)…he will be accountable for his ‘son stroke’.”Lalu Prasad called the probe agencies new “alliance partners” of the government and underlined that his voice will not be suppressed. In a series of tweets, Prasad said he will neither bend nor get scared.Congress sought to broaden the issue, saying the government was systematically targeting Opposition leaders. “The truth is that revenge has become the DNA of the BJP government. We want to reiterate that neither P Chidambaram, nor any Congress leader or any other leader of Opposition would be deterred or cowed down from fear of politics of revenge and vendetta,” said party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.Goyal dismissed these charges and maintained that the government does not interfere in affairs of investigating agencies.“After all, it is not us who demanded reopening of fodder scam cases. The Supreme Court gave the verdict,” he said.

respected maams,

it is a common knowledge that recent Gandhi dynasty, i.e. ex-Bar baala Sonia ji, Colossal Pappu a.k.a. Rahul baba, Hottie with killer looks like her Grandma Priyanka and others (like maneka and effin tarun varum whatever his name iz) are not related to the **MAHATMA MOHANDAS KARAM CHAND GANDHI**.


thus, so to clearly differentiate them, we have devised a new fool proof way of giving credit where it is due. i.e. **GHANDHI**.


see if you break it down 

GHANDHI=  GHAND + HI

when we read them in hindi ""GHAND"" means ""गन्ध"" meaning sweet scent.

and ""hi"" means ""ही"" meaning ""only""

thus GHANDHI means ""Sweet Scent only""

its our tribute to great **Mahatma**

70,"Amid raids on P Chidamabaram &amp; Lalu's kin, Mamata and Sonia talk of 'vendetta'

Mohua Chatterjee
NEW DELHI: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday to add heft to the opposition's attempts at putting up a joint candidate for the presidential polls and urged the government to go for a consensus over the nominee for the top job. 

After the meeting with Sonia who has been at the forefront of opposition's efforts to field a joint candidate, the Trinamool chief said, ""India is a vast country and unity is our biggest strength. Hence it is better for the country to go in for a consensus candidate."" 

She said the ""government should take initiative to build a consensus"" on the presidential candidate. 

Banerjee said apart from presidential polls, she also discussed the Modi government's ""vendetta politics"" with Sonia on a day CBI raided premises of Karti Chidambaram, son of former Union minister P Chidamabaram, while I-T department carried out raids at several locations in connection with alleged benami property deals linked to RJD chief Lalu Prasad's family members. 

Banerjee lashed out at the Centre for using CBI and other central agencies to get at rival political parties and leaders, saying ""confrontation cannot be the way to function in a democracy"". 

""You have seen what has gone on for the entire day (referring to CBI/IT raids)... whoever they (the Centre) don't like they will send to jail, put CBI behind them, mark them as terrorists... whether it is Naveenji (Patnaik), Laluji (Prasad), Chidambaramji, Akhilesh, Mayawati, Kejriwal, Virbhadraji and also us (TMC). But we will not allow democracy to be bulldozed,"" she told reporters after emerging from the meeting at 10, Jan Path. 

Banerjee said no names were discussed during the meeting with Sonia Gandhi, also attended by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. 

Congress appeared to toe the line of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar who batted for a second term for President Pranab Mukherjee. 

""We are extremely proud of the fact that Mukherjee comes from the pedigree of an ideology that has been the centre point of this country from its formation up till today and would be in future. 

As far as candidate for the post of President and Vice President are concerned, they are intrinsic to our democratic set up for not only is the President the Supreme Commander of our Armed Forces, he is also the protector of our Constitution,"" party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. 

""It is also the role of President or Vice president to counter the government when it loses its way. So bereft of political partisanship, you need on these posts an individual who will be able to uphold the highest principles as enshrined in our Constitution. Congress president and Congress vice president will confer with leaders of other political parties and we will try and build a consensus around it,"" he added. 

Banerjee is expected to meet President Pranab Mukherjee besides Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.",2017-05-17 09:21:47

**Nuke MoU: Govt makes Russia sweat before PM Modi-Putin meet** 

 ______ 
issue of India's NSG membership +

endorsed Beijing' OBOR +

CPEC which raises sovereignty issues for India +

India has warned Russia that it will stall cooperation with its foreign partners for development of its civil nuclear programme if it is unable to become a full member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in the near future. To make its point, it is threatening to put in cold storage an MoU with Russia for developing Kudankulam 5 and 6 reactor units.With Russia working increasingly in tandem with China on global issues, India has often looked at Moscow to persuade Beijing to let go of its opposition to India's membership. Russia is now worried that India might be delaying the MoU to get Moscow to work more proactively for its NSG membership.Taken aback by this Indian reluctance to seal the MoU, a top official source confirmed to TOI, Russia's deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin took up the issue with PM Narendra Modi in their meeting last week. Rogozin, however, left the country without any clear assurance from India on signing the MoU.The meeting was held to prepare the groundwork for Modi's summit with President Vladimir Putin early next month. Moscow is now worried that without the MoU, there will be no real takeaway from the summit which is barely two weeks away. Russia remains India's oldest and most reliable partner in the development of its nuclear energy programme.India's message to Russia, conveyed to Moscow through official channels around the time the last NSG meeting was held, is said to have been quite explicit in nature. It stated that without NSG membership in the next 1-2 years, India would have no option but to go for an indigenous nuclear energy programme. TOI was unable to ascertain if a similar 'threat' was made to the US and France, two other important partners in nuclear energy, but it's clear that the government sees Russia as the only big power which has enough influence with Beijing to soften its position on theTOI has learnt that despite repeated exhortations for over 6 months, Russia has been unable to convince India to sign the MoU which was originally meant to have been signed on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Goa last year. It was then said that it would be signed by the end of 2016 but halfway into 2017, India continues to hold back on it despite issues like pricing and technology having been long settled.Moscow is concerned that India is not responding to its request for signing the MoU even weeks ahead of the Modi-Putin summit. It sees nuclear energy cooperation as one of the most significant elements of its bilateral relationship with India.India has at several levels in the past asked Russia to persuade Beijing which continues to back a criteria-based, and not a merit-based approach as desired by India, for expansion of the global body which controls nuclear commerce.While Russia has worked hard to secure support for India's membership, New Delhi clearly believes that it hasn't done enough to convince China which sees Moscow as a key partner in dealing with the emerging international situation. However, the Russians seem to believe that India has only further complicated its case by inviting Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh and that this will only see China further hardening its position.Russia's interests now converge sharply with China's as evident also from the way it has. Putin himself attended this week the OBOR conference which India chose to ignore. Russia, like several Indian neighbours, maintains that its endorsement of OBOR has nothing to do with the contentious. Moscow's strategic embrace of Pakistan made manifest in its first joint military exercise with the latter last year has also spooked India.That India might shun foreign collaboration in nuclear energy is also interesting. The government only recently reiterated in Parliament that it expects to raise nuclear power generation capacity to 15,000 MW by 2024 from the 4780 MW that it was in 2014.

**'Have Evidence Against Lalu Yadav? Move Court': Nitish Kumar To BJP** 

 ______ 
Nitish Kumar said there was no need for ""a third party"" to comment on the
issue.

**Patna: **

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar broke his silence yesterday on the
corruption allegations against the family of alliance partner Lalu Yadav,
saying if the BJP has proof, it should take legal action. Mr Kumar - who
joined hands with rival Mr Yadav to keep the BJP out of power in Bihar two
years ago - had maintained a silence as the BJP piled up its allegations
against Mr Yadav.

""If the BJP has documents, then it should take legal recourse to prove their
accusations,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust of India. The
response was to allegations that Mr Yadav's family has amassed illegal
property through shell companies.

""This is not an issue that falls in the domain of the state government nor in
the company law of Bihar,"" Mr Kumar said. There was no need for ""a third
party"" to comment on the issue, he added.

The BJP's allegations - ranging from the alleged soil scam to his links with
notorious gangster Shahabuddin- had been mostly levelled by Sushil Kumar Modi,
Mr Kumar's former deputy before the two parties parted company.

Over the last month, Mr Modi held 10 press conferences at which he has
furnished documents that he says proves that Mr Yadav's sons, Tejashwi and Tej
Pratap, who are ministers in Mr Kumar's cabinet, are beneficiaries of secret
land deals.

Asked about allegations that information on property details have been
concealed in election affidavits filed by Mr Yadav's family members, Mr Kumar,
however, said if such information was not revealed, then an explanation should
be given. ""After all we are leading a public life where moral and ethical
values do matter a lot,"" he added.

Alleging that the Chief Minister was appearing to back the Lalu Yadav's
family, Mr Modi said he must have been afraid that action against the RJD
chief could lead to the fall of the state government.

A statement from him read: ""Nitish Kumar has broken his silence after 40 days
since the first expose of benami properties amassed by the RJD supremo and his
family, but did not promise any action against them fearing fall of the grand
alliance government.""

Mr Kumar, who is serving his third consecutive term as the Chief Minister, had
stitched together a grand alliance with Lalu Yadav's RJD and the Congress
ahead of the assembly elections in 2015. In the election, the RJD won more
seats and remained the senior partner.

But with his conviction in the first fodder scam case negating the possibility
of his holding public office, he said he would honour a pre-election agreement
that Mr Kumar will retain the Chief Minister's Office. His two sons were
inducted in the cabinet.

**NDA beats UPA, rolls out roads faster** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government's work order for highway expansion has shot up by 122% during the first three years of Modi government and the pace of construction has gone up by 25%, according to data released by the road transport and highways ministry During 2011-2014, daily highway construction was about 13 km in comparison to 17 km during the three years' of Modi government.The acceleration in award of works to road builders — over 11,000 km on an average in the past three years against only 5,000 during UPA 's corresponding period — has significance considering that this will translate into actual construction of roads by April 2019 when the government faces election.It is expected that by 2019, the government will be in a position to achieve more than 30 km of highway construction per day, a source said.Highways minister Nitin Gadkari has set the target of pushing daily highway construction to 41 km.Highway development is considered one of the biggest job generators and increased road connectivity has been recognised as a major contributor to economic activities even in the hinterlands.However, for the current financial year, the government has set the target of awarding at least 30% of highway projects on public private partnership (PPP). Last year only 17% projects were bid out on PPP mode.Similarly, shipping ministry data show high increase in capacity of 12 major ports under government from 745 million tonnes in 2012-13 to 1,065 million tonnes in 2016-17.The total cargo handled at all these ports have also increased from 570 million tonnes in 2011-12 to 648 million tonnes during the last financial year.Officials said there has been a greater cohesive planning in the road, rail, shipping and waterways sectors to improve connectivity, which was missing during the earlier government.Target for smart tags The government has set the target of a three-fold increase in installation of FASTags in vehicles in the next one year. Till March end, about 4.1 lakh such tags have been fixed in vehicles, which allow these vehicles to pass through toll plazas on highways without waiting at toll gates.At a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi earlier this month, the roads ministry has been asked to increase it to 15 lakh by April 2018 and 25 lakh by 2020.

**Nagpur, Which Is 'Zero Mile', Will Turn Into India's Warehouse** 

 ______ 
The city known as zero mile in India is finally in the right place at the
right time.

Nagpur is in the dead center of the country, at the crossroads of busy road
and rail corridors that bisect India east to west and north to south. Now,
India is on the cusp of a sweeping tax overhaul that could turn the city of
2.4 million people into one of the nation's biggest logistics hubs.

Known for its oranges, tiger sanctuaries, and 45-degree Celsius (108
Fahrenheit) summer heat, Nagpur has seen a groundswell of investment from
retailers and warehouse companies betting that the debut of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's national goods-and-service tax on July 1 will transform the
city's fortunes.

""The revolution has started,"" said Manoj Muti, a supervisor at a warehouse in
the city that stores goods of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd., one of the nation's top
organic-food producers.

The new tax will replace layers of provincial levies and unify India's 29
states into a single market. Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said it could
push economic growth into double digits by eliminating shipping delays across
state borders and cutting corruption.

""There will be no need for border controls,"" Gadkari said in a May 10
interview in his home in New Delhi. ""There will be smooth flow of transport
from one state to another.""

At present, trucks can queue for up to three kilometers to pay an entry fee at
New Delhi's 122 checkpoints. About 75 percent of the country's road-hauling
firms operated fleets of fewer than five trucks, according to a 2014
government report.

While the new GST won't solve many structural problems of India's transport
network, it could trim logistics costs of companies producing non-bulk goods
by as much as 20 percent, according to an estimate by Crisil Ltd., a Mumbai-
based unit of S&amp;amp;P Global Inc.

That makes Nagpur on the vast Deccan plateau attractive as a central store for
goods. Some 800 kilometers from either the Bay of Bengal to the east or the
Arabian Sea to the west, and more than 1,000 kilometers from either Delhi to
the north, or Chennai to the south, Nagpur has been at the center of the
country's trade routes for centuries.

Nearby coal reserves have long fueled power stations and industries helping
make it the country's 13-largest metropolitan economy. But a tangle of
provincial taxes to move goods across states have hampered its role as a
centralized base for goods.

""The cost to move goods from port to the Mediterranean and China is cheaper
than it is to move goods from here to port,"" said Sanjay Sharma, chief
executive officer of Nagpur operations for Distribution Logistics
Infrastructure Pvt. The former ship captain, 48, who used to steer vessels
through the cool waters of Canada's Great Lakes, now oversees the ramp up of a
new logistics park in the sweltering, landlocked city.

The 30-hectare park has just been completed by DLI, a unit of London-listed
investment fund Infrastructure India Plc. Surrounded by fields southwest of
the city, its large, white, liquid storage tank is blinding in the sun, while
rail cars wait in a dedicated siding near a line of trucks, ready to move
containers of goods.

The country's biggest shipping companies including Container Corp. of India
Ltd., Mahindra Logistics Ltd. and Transport Corp. of India Ltd. are all
setting up facilities in Nagpur, along with U.S.-based Deere &amp;amp; Co.

It isn't just an accident of geography that puts the city in a sweet spot.
Nagpur is home to Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the
ideological parent of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Transport Minister
Gadkari, who was elected from Nagpur, has said he is a member of the RSS,
while Modi once worked for the organization, whose 57,000 branches across
India provided grassroots support for his election.

With political clout comes development.

Construction works are busy across Nagpur, including a $1.3 billion metro. A
joint venture water project by Vishvaraj Infrastructure Ltd. and Veolia Water
SA of France would make Nagpur the first city in India to provide all
residents, even slum-dwellers, with a continuous supply of clean water. And
the city's vendors of clothes, spices and famous Nagpur oranges will get a new
wholesale market built by Vishvaraj.

""Political will is essential for change,"" said Arun Lakhani, chairman of
Vishvaraj, sitting in his office as workers lay cable in the street outside.
""With the GST and the free movement of goods, the very disadvantage of being
at the center will be translated into a real economic advantage.""

The change has been a long time coming for a city that has spent decades in
the shadow of Maharashtra state's premier economic center: Mumbai.

As early as 2002, the state conceived a special economic zone around a new
airport, called the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur.
Known as Mihan, it has already drawn some of the nation's top technology
firms, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd.

But controversies over land acquisition and delays mean the airport has yet to
be expanded, while a recent visit to the rail connection showed only a handful
of workers carrying stones in baskets on their heads in the time-honored way.

Pirojshaw Sarkari, CEO of Mahindra Logistics, says Mihan needs to be fast-
tracked, shipping clearances need to be put under one government department
and electricity prices should fall.

And DLI's Sharma says there are other problems GST won't fix, including power
and rail staff shortages, especially in the summer.

Rail freight remains at the mercy of India's overcrowded rail network, where a
trip from Mumbai to Nagpur can take 72 hours when it should take 18, according
to DLI's Sharma. Freight trains clank around the nation's more than 66,000
kilometers of lines at an average speed of 24 kilometers per hour (15 mph).
And despite huge improvements in the past two decades, the government is still
spending billions to upgrade the world's second-biggest road network.

Even with the new tax, trucks may still face delays at state borders due to
the need to monitor details of shipments. A system of electronic scanners is
supposed to speed up the process, but with the GST deadline looming, Gadkari
said the tendering process for the scanners would only be completed ""within a
month.""

For Nagpur, though, the GST is a step in the right direction.

In a warehouse the size of seven football fields run by Mumbai-based supply-
chain company Future Group, CEO Kishore Biyani shows businessmen a
2.5-kilometer spiraling conveyor belt that sorts packages of Lee Cooper and
other clothing brands into 40,000 cases per day.

""Now you can invest in large scale,"" Biyani said. ""You don't need to think
small.""

New Delhi: Turbo Megha Airways has become the first private airline to get a licence to fly under Udan, the government scheme for subsidized regional flights.

The Hyderabad-based airline, which flies as TruJet, last month said it will launch flights on Hyderabad-Cuddapah, Hyderabad-Nanded and Nanded-Mumbai routes.

A spokesman for Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the aviation regulator on Wednesday issued the first air operator certificate in the scheduled commuter category to Turbo Megha Airways.

“Earlier, being scheduled regional, they could not operate to metros of other regions. Under SCO (scheduled commuter operator) category, they can operate to metros of other regions.”

TruJet is one of the five operators who have been awarded a total of 128 routes under the Udan scheme. The airline will use three ATR-72 aircraft, and will add more planes later.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the first flight under the scheme on the Shimla-Delhi route on 27 April. The flight will be operated by Alliance Air, the regional arm of Air India.

Under the scheme, fares have been capped at Rs2,500 for a one-hour flight. The government has also extended subsidy in the form of viability gap funding to the operators flying on these routes.

The five airlines awarded the rights to fly Udan flights are Air India, SpiceJet, Turbo Megha, Air Odisha and G.R. Gopinath led Deccan Air.

**OBOR is the grandest failure of Indian foreign policy** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Vigyan Bhawan. Express Photo by Renuka Puri Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Vigyan Bhawan. Express Photo by Renuka Puri

As the Narendra Modi government completes three years of its tryst with electoral destiny on May 16, it could not have wished for a more portentous international conference in far, but yet nearby, Beijing.

The One Belt One Road conference convened by the People’s Republic of China over the weekend to unveil and showcase the most ambitious connectivity project of modern times represents the grandest failure of Indian foreign policy and it’s quarantine into splendid isolation. However, first a word about the project.

Watch: Opinion | CPEC: Chinese Colonisation of Pakistan?

Chinese president Xi Jinping, in 2013, unveiled a novel economic structure that would connect China’s Silk Road Mercantile Belt project in Central Asia with its Maritime Silk Road, through linked bodies of water from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean. In principle, these trade stratagems centre on increasing China’s connection with countries along the ancient Silk Road in Eurasia, while creating a new Silk Road across Asia to South Asia and Africa.

One part of the project is focused on the creation of road connections between China and Eurasia, involving infrastructure projects such as highways and rail links. The other part of the project concerns maritime routes that will connect China with South East Asia, South Asia and ports up and down the east coast of Africa.

The measure of this concept, if it ever reaches fruition, is both the project’s greatest hawking point and conceivable trial. The trade links once established will cover 65 per cent of the world’s population, one-third of global GDP and a quarter of all goods and services in the international economy.

Such a focus of goods and services will upturn how conventional products, such as energy, are traded. Observers draw parallels with the Marshall Plan that reinvented Europe post the Second World War. With enormous sums of money, ranging from $ 800 billion to $1 trillion to be invested over the next five years, there is a lot of cash to spread around, even in China’s extended neighbourhood.

In comparison, the investment into the Pakistani component of this initiative, the Chinese Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), anywhere between $46-62 billion, is a mere pittance.

The summit in Beijing over the weekend was attended by 29 heads of states and governments which included Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Sri Lankan PM Ranil Wickermasinghe, delegations from all other South Asian countries barring Bhutan, as well as leaders and officials from the big boys on the global stage, namely Russia, US, Japan, UK, Germany and France.

That is where India’s lack of nimbleness became counterproductive. While our objection to the CPEC is extremely valid — that it passes through territory acceded to India by the erstwhile Maharaja of Jammu Kashmir, Hari Singh, on October 26,1947 and whatever is in the possession of Pakistan is illegally occupied — the moot point remains that we were not able to carry any of the big powers, including the US, and especially our neighbors along on the vital question of Westphalian sovereignty.

By boycotting the summit rather than showing up and making our voice heard loud and clear in the comity of nations, India has in fact sent out a message that it will make proforma noise on this issue but actually acquiesce to the fait accompli.

What this lack of dexterity does is allow the Chinese embrace of Pakistan to get even tighter. A front page exclusive in Pakistan’s ‘Dawn’ newspaper for the first time revealed to Pakistanis themselves the extent of Chinese colonisation this project would entail. But given the desperate, if not perilous, situation that Pakistan finds itself in, it would be surprising if there is any substantive protest by any section of the population.

A strategic relationship transformed into an economic vested interest means that India cannot bank upon Chinese neutrality in case of a possible conflict with Pakistan – which India may blunder into as the BJP-led government works overtime to use the Kashmir flashpoint to drive home the otherness of the citizens to the rest of India.

A two-front situation may become an unfortunate imperative that India may just have to deal with, given the fact China is revising its position on accepted principles with regard to the territorial dispute with India, in the protracted but ongoing Special Representative process.

With Gwadar becoming operational, China would be able to surmount its Malacca Dilemma — that is pump and transport it’s energy and mineral resources directly to Kashgar as they exit the Straits of Hormuz — thereby circumventing the Malacca chokepoint.

The fact remains that India would have to deal with Pakistani and Chinese navies jointly patrolling the Arabian Sea off India’s western seaboard and directly threatening India’s energy and resource supply lines. The story does not end there. With Hambantota also being developed as a Chinese resourced port in Sri Lanka, the Gwadar-Hamabantota axis may end up emerging as an access denial area in India’s home waters.

Then there is the eastern headache, which is the growing Chinese proximity to Nepal and Bangladesh, as well as the deep economic linkages with Myanmar. While Sheikh Hasina’s government is very friendly towards India, that may not be the permanent state of play. There is a perception in the Bangladesh polity, especially the principal opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), that India has put all its eggs into one basket.

Given the strained relations with Nepal post the economic blockade of 2015, Kathmandu’s propensity to explore other options especially energises the torturous land route with China.

While all this infrastructure development has been in the works for a while, where the Modi government has tripped badly is in its inability to tread the fine balance between the big powers. Though it’s perceived cosiness towards the US has not borne any tangible fruit in the past three years, what it has achieved is to drive both Russia and China into a state of ambivalence and antagonism, respectively. There is no better evidence of this than the recent Russian-Pakistani defense exercises, a first in 70 years.

It is therefore in India’s larger national interest to not allow the China-Pakistan embrace to turn into its greatest strategic nightmare. India must finesse it’s relationship with China, for there are other implications, namely in Afghanistan.

This is only one of the great blunders over the past three years. The others will follow in the days to come.

**West Bengal municipal polls: TMC going strong, setback for BJP** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Trinamool Congress wins majority of seats in municipal elections in West Bengal.

2 BJP has received a setback as it has managed to win just three seats.

3 TMC has won Pujali, Raiganj, Domkal and Mirik.

The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has won the municipal elections in West Bengal, winning majority of the seats in four out of seven bodies. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and BJP combine won the remaining three municipal bodies. However, TMC made inroads in the hills by winning the Mirik municipality.

The results conclusively prove that TMC is going strong in the state despite the spate of corruption cases against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led party. Secondly, TMC has maintained its hold over the electorate in the plains besides making inroads in the hills.

The seven municipalities which went to polls are Kurseong, Darjeeling and Mirik in Darjeeling district; Kalimpong in the newly announced Kalimpong district; Pujali in South 24 Parganas district; Raiganj in North Dinajpur district; and Domkal municipality in Murshidabad district.

TMC has won Pujali, Raiganj, Domkal and Mirik while GJM-BJP combine has bagged Kurseong, Darjeeling and Kalimpong.

SETBACK FOR BJP

The results of the municipal elections also point towards BJP's failure to establish themselves as an alternative to the ruling TMC. BJP has received a setback as it has managed to win just three seats - two of the total 16 in Pujali and one out of 27 in Raiganj.

BJP had campaigned aggressively for the municipal elections which were held on May 14, though amidst complains of violence and booth-capturing. The opposition parties had demanded scrapping of the municipal elections.

BJP'S MULTI-PRINGED STRATEGY FAILS

The party ruling at the Centre has launched a multi-pronged strategy to register an impressive performance in the 2019 lok Sabha elections. In a bid to strengthen the organization, BJP president Amit Shah had toured West Bengal to launch 'Vistar Yatra' in Naxalbari on April 25.

He visited a tribal's house and knocked door-to-door as part of an intensive booth-level mass contact programme in the cradle of the 50-year-old Maoist movement. He also held a meeting of party workers in booth number 93 of the Naxalbari Assembly constituency.

Amit Shah also went to Mamata Banerjee's Bhawanipur constituency in Kolkata the next day and launched mission ""Ebaar Bangla"" (West Bengal this time).

BJP has been attacking Mamata Banerjee and TMC over the corruption cases and law and order issues. It harped on scams like Narada, Sarada and Rose Valley. With senior TMC leaders such as Sudip Banerjee and Tapas Pal behind the bars, BJP highlighted the corruption by the ruling party during Mamata Banerjee's regime.

The party also strived hard to publicise the developmental programmes of the Modi government.

However, these efforts seem to have made no mark in the municipal elections.

NO ENCOURAGING SIGNS FOR BJP SINCE 2016 ASSEMBLY AND 2014 LOK SABHA POLLS

In the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections, BJP had bagged three seats as against just one which it had won in the 2011 polls. In 2011, BJP had garnered about 4 per cent votes which increased to 10.2 per cent vote share in 2016.

The party hopes that a jump of more than 20 per cent vote share will get translated into seats in the next polls.

BJP had garnered 17.5 per cent votes in West Bengal during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. This dipped to 10.2 per cent in the 2016 Assembly polls. Despite this setback, BJP won three seats for the first time in the state. In 2016 polls, BJP not only fetched about 56 lakh votes, as against 19.5 lakh in 2011, it also made its presence felt in 262 out of 294 Assembly segments by polling more than 10,000 votes.

In 2014, BJP believes it had secured 17 per cent votes because of the Narendra Modi wave across the country. It did not have any organisational base then. In 2016, there was no such wave. What it achieved was because of the organisational strength.

More than winning three seats, the party made its presence felt in maximum seats and secured second position in seven seats. It secured between 20,000 and 30,000 votes in 66 seats, 30,000 and 40,000 votes in 16 seats and between 40,000 and 50,000 votes in six seats.

BJP was instrumental in the defeat of 70 candidates of Congress and the Left by eating into their vote share and garnering about 5,000 to 10,000 votes.

Despite these statistics, BJP has been left far behind TMC in the municipal elections. This may force the party to work harder and rework its strategy to present itself as an alternative to TMC in the state.

**Three years of Modi government: Here’s how the markets have performed** 

 ______ 
In the three years since the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government came to power at the centre, Indian stock markets have been largely on an upward march, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty currently hovering around record highs. The government’s policy initiatives and the BJP’s win in the Uttar Pradesh elections have reinforced investors’ faith in the reforms process and triggered hopes for long-term political stability in the country.

How contribution of sectors to BSE’s market capitalization has changed

Market capitalization of companies listed on the BSE has grown to Rs127 trillion in three years, rising 59% from Rs80 trillion on 16 May 2014. The Sensex accounts for 40.4% of BSE’s total market cap. Its contribution has declined from 49.6% on 16 May 2014. The contribution of the BSE MidCap index has increased to 14.86% from 13.94% in the same period.

Most preferred Sensex stocks, then and now

Three years after the NDA government took charge, ITC Ltd, Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd have retained their position in the list of 10 most preferred Sensex stocks by analysts. Banks seem to be in favour currently, with State Bank of India and HDFC Bank Ltd also in the list of preferred stocks, as analysts bet on an improvement in economic growth. There was no clear trend in preferences three years ago.

Top 10 gainers in three years of Modi government

The Sensex has gained 26.8% while the Nifty has surged 32% in the three years till 16 May 2017. In the same period, the BSE MidCap index has soared 94% while BSE SmallCap has risen 96%. Eleven stocks have gained 1,000-1,800%. Around 62 stocks have fallen 1-81% in the period, including heavyweights such as Tata Motors Ltd (down 1.74%), Tech Mahindra Ltd (2.6%), Punjab National Bank (4.84%) and Coal India Ltd (20.4%).

**India To Build 10 Heavy Water Nuclear Reactors, Create 33,000 Jobs** 

 ______ 
The plan to build 10 nuclear reactors will generate business worth Rs 70,000
crore.

**New Delhi: **

India will develop 10 heavy water nuclear reactors - a plan the government
says will generate business worth 70,000 crores and create 33,000 jobs. The
government's initiative came as India's efforts to enter the Nuclear Suppliers
Group -- a global club that controls nuclear commerce, remains stalled. The
government now plans to generate 63,000 MW (megawatts) of nuclear power by
2032 and ramp it up to supply 25 per cent of electricity by 2050.

The cabinet cleared the plan today, said Union Minister Piyush Goyal after
attending a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The plan to fast-track the domestic nuclear power programme also marks a
response to the near collapse of Westinghouse. Talks were on with the US
reactor maker to build six its AP1000 reactors in India. The firm, owned by
Japan's Toshiba, filed for bankruptcy in March, raising doubts about whether
it can complete the India deal.

India gets its bulk of electricity by burning coal. Nuclear power accounts for
just two per cent of the country's needs. For years, India had been pushing to
develop indigenous technology in nuclear power. Currently the country
generates 6,780 MW nuclear power -- building capacity for another 6,700 MW is
in the pipeline.

Out of India's 22 operational nuclear reactors, 18 use heavy water - a safer
and more efficient technology. But most of the reactors have lower capacity.
The new reactors will generate 700 MW power each.

Indian companies such as Larsen and Toubro, Kirloskar Brother Limited and
Godrej &amp;amp; Boyce welcomed the government's move. ""Nuclear power plants will
go a long way in reducing the perennial energy deficit,"" Sanjay Kirloskar,
chairman of Kirloskar Brother Limited was quoted as saying by news agency
Reuters. Larsen and Toubro's director SN Roy called the move ""bold and
historic"".

A heavy water reactor uses natural uranium as fuel unlike light water
reactors, which use enriched uranium. Heavy water reactors are safer and more
efficient and get more output for the same quantity of uranium than one using
normal water. They can also be fuelled without shutting down, which helps them
run for long runs without a break.

India had imported the PHWR (Pressurized heavy-water reactor) technology from
Canada, but after the 1974 nuclear explosion at Pokharan, when Canada
abandoned all cooperation, Indian scientists mastered the making of these
reactors, which come in three variants 220 MW, 540 MW and 700 MW units.

**Modi-fied Indian markets enter $2-trillion elite club; experts see more fireworks ahead** 

 ______ 
Buoyed by relentless buying by local and offshore investors, India's stock market capitalisation (M-cap) has crossed $2 trillion, making it the ninth-largest equity market globally and second, after China, in the universe of emerging markets, according to Bloomberg data. The spurt in stock prices has pushed up India's M-capto-GDP ratio, a tool used by equity strategists to assess the relative valuation of a market, well above the 10-year average.A runaway bull market looks at ways to endorse the euphoria on the Street. With M-cap-to-GDP at 0.88, analysts believe there is tailwind left in the Indian equity story as markets are perceived to be expensive only when this ratio exceeds 1.Typically, the M-cap-to-GDP ratio is anywhere between 0.2 and 0.8 for emerging markets while it moves in a wider range of 0.5-2.2 for developed markets. ""India has the largest number of listed companies in the world. Interestingly, nearly 50 per cent of the actively traded companies have M-cap of less than Rs 500 crore.This suggests that Indian companies go public much earlier than in most other large economies. The relatively high Mcap-to-GDP ratio in India, therefore, is reflective of strong appetite of Indian entrepreneurs to access public equity funding and the willingness of Indian equity investors to fund such entrepreneurs,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at brokerage Anand Rathi.For India, the ratio, with a 10-year average of 0.78, had peaked at 1.48 in 2007. Based on such a hypothesis, the local M-cap has to rise another 10 per cent for India to be perceived as an expensive market. Since January, local stocks have generated 28 per cent returns in dollar terms — the highest among the top 20 global markets based on M-cap.""India can see further expansion in the M-cap-to-GDP ratio as private and government capex kicks in. The possibility of rating upgrade by the year-end could push up the ratio further. It can reach 1.1 to 1.2,"" said A Balasubramanian, CEO, Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, reflecting the mood in the market.Emerging markets such as Brazil and Mexico have among the lowest M-cap-to-GDP ratios of 0.18 and 0.27, respectively, thanks to their higher dependence on commodities amid falling prices. For France and Germany, it's at 0.67 and 0.47, respectively, even though their benchmark indices are at new highs.India's contribution to global M-cap has risen to a six-year high of 2.7 per cent against a six-year average of 2.2 per cent . It has doubled in the past three years. India's contribution to global GDP is 2.9 per cent , up from 2.4 per cent in 2013.""The ideal ratio for M-cap to GDP globally has been 1:1. However, India's M-cap and GDP are expected to be in the range of $8-10 trillion by 2030, based on estimates of several institutions.Thus, we see potential for equities market from current levels,"" said Sunil Singhania, CIO at Reliance MF

**Chandigarh babus invent way to gift themselves VIP numbers, forced to backtrack** 

 ______ 
CHANDIGARH: At a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated moves to end the country's VIP culture , bureaucrats in the Chandigarh Administration, which is directly under the central government, found a new way to favour themselves with high-end numbers for their cars -- causing hundreds of thousands of rupees in losses to the public exchequer.Under fire from the media, activists and others for the unprecedented move to oblige themselves and other officers, the Chandigarh Administration on Tuesday rolled back the earlier notification allowing officers to reserve or block VIP numbers for themselves.Through a notification issued in March, the Chandigarh Administration allowed ""dignitaries/officers"" to take a number of their choice from the registration series.Transport Secretary K.K. Jindal, who controls the registration and licensing authority (RLA), got the number ""CH01-BM-0001"" reserved in the new series for the Toyota Crysta MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) in the name of his wife.The number, which could have fetched hundreds of thousands of rupees for the government through an open auction, was withdrawn from the auction list of the new 'CH01-BM' series announced earlier this month. The numbers offered for auction were from '0002' to '9999'. The registration for auction of the new series will be done from May 11 to 17.Jindal who, sources say, has now surrendered the number that he had blocked, had to dish out a partly Rs 5,000 for a number that goes for Rs 5 to10 lakh and is quite a craze in Chandigarh.The VIP or vanity registration numbers for motor vehicles, especially cars, fetch high auction prices from the public. The number, for many, is a status symbol.The highest amount for the VIP number ""0001"" was a staggering Rs 26.5 lakh paid by farmer-landlord Amarjit Singh for his high-end Rs 90-lakh Mercedes S-class in August 2012.In June 2012, businessman Jagjit Singh Chahal bid Rs 17 lakh for CH-01-AN-0001 for his car. In April 2012, controversial former Haryana Director General of Police S.P.S. Rathore paid Rs 10 lakh for registration number CH-01-AM-0001 for the Mercedes he bought for his lawyer wife.The ""0001"" number has a reserve price of Rs 50,000 in Chandigarh. Jindal, being an officer in the administration, was exempted even from paying the reserve price and was to pay only the fee of Rs 5,000.""On an average, the '0001' number goes for anything from Rs 5 to 10 lakh. The lowest bid in recent years was at Rs 70,000 for this number,"" an RLA official told IANS.In February, the ""0001"" number of the ""CH-O1-BL"" series went for Rs 6.70 lakh.""The dignitaries/officers in Chandigarh Motor Vehicle Rules shall be eligible for allotment of such registration marks for the vehicle to be registered in their own (or spouse's) name without payment of any additional fee limited to only two registration marks during their service tenure. However, the sale/transfer of ownership of a vehicle bearing such a registration mark to a non-eligible person, within one year of its initial registration, shall be allowed only after payment of the reserve price, stated a press release of the administration dated March 22, quoting the amended notification.The notification allows officers/dignitaries to reserve VIP numbers twice in their service tenure. IAS and IPS officers come to Chandigarh on a deputation of two to three years.Activists have written to Chandigarh Administrator V.P. Singh Badnore saying that the move by the officers was against the norm of a level playing field. They have even suggested that the administration keep the reserve price of single digit VIP numbers at Rs 5 lakh, on the pattern of Haryana and Delhi.(Jaideep Sarin can be contacted at jaideep.s@ians.in)

**Narendra Modi’s stealth privatisation: Over 3 years, shares of PSUs in overall market cap down by a fourth** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi. (PTI)

Though there are no corresponding entries in the government’s books, in the three years that Narendra Modi has been in charge, he has effectively privatised a bit more than a fourth of the country’s PSU network, both for banks as well as non-banks. And while there have been no howls of protest from the Left and other pseudo-Left parties like the Congress, there has been none of the usual gushy praise from the country’s pink press either, the usual votary of privatisation. That’s because, while real privatisation involves putting unproductive or less-productive public sector assets in the hands of the private sector in the hope of a turnaround—witness what Anil Agarwal did for Hindustan Zinc—not resolving the problems of PSU banks and non-banks has simply eroded their market capitalisation further.

In the case of PSU banks, it fell from 54% of the market capitalisation of all banks in May 2009 when UPA-2 took charge, to 43% in May 2014 when Modi came in, to 31% today; in the case of non-banks, it fell from 31% to 22% to 16%, respectively. How soon the government will come up with a workable solution to resolving the NPA problem of PSU banks—critical to their valuation rising—is unclear, but the fact that an insolvency code has been legislated means it should be easier to remove defaulter-promoters. The real issue, of how bankers are to get the confidence that their decisions on haircuts are not open to review by CBI/CVC/CAG or the courts, is what the government needs to address.

The problem is not restricted to just banks. With PSUs not having as many incentives to perform as the private sector, and the fact that they have too many unreasonable constraints—that go beyond the 3Cs—means they are often competing with both their hands tied behind their back. So, while a private company can simply award a contract to the best supplier, a PSU must tender it out—in the case of BSNL, this column has reported, the PSU saw the courts ordering cancellation of its tender for new cellular lines several times; not surprisingly, private players like Bharti Airtel beat the capacity-starved PSU in even rural areas more than a decade ago.

The amazing lengths to which this PSUs-are-an-arm-of-the-state policy has gone is best highlighted by a story in The Indian Express last week which said the law ministry had, based on various high court and Supreme Court rulings, opined that campus recruitments by PSUs could be viewed as unconstitutional and discriminatory since this gives an advantage to those in the colleges the PSUs recruit from! The flip-side of this is, with lifetime employment more or less guaranteed, there is a tendency to be complacent among PSU staff—so, despite its market share becoming almost non-existent, MTNL still has a huge staff of around 32,000 people and a wage bill that is 75% of its turnover against an industry norm of 5%. If this ratio, in the case of BSNL which has a larger market-share, is 41%, it is not clear how merging the two PSUs will help, but that is what the government is hell bent on.

Despite this, many will argue, PSUs remain profitable—even after taking into account losses of Rs 28,756 crore, central PSUs made an overall profit of Rs 115,767 crore in FY16. Almost 18% of this profit, however, comes from the coal sector where there is no private competition; 23% came from petroleum where PSUs like ONGC either got the best acreages or like GAIL/IOC/HPCL/BPCL have quasi-monopolies on distribution. Indeed, a CAG report pointed out that, in FY15, 11 of 34 listed PSUs had an interest cover of less than one, as did 67of the 124 unlisted ones—this makes their revival almost impossible.

Also Watch:

Hindustan Photo Films, one of these PSUs, has 352 employees, and keeping it alive has meant its losses going up from Rs 1,561 crore in FY13 to Rs 2,528 crore in FY16. Not surprisingly, in terms of market capitalisation, that of PSUs rose a mere 8% in the last three years versus a whopping 58% for non-PSUs. Since most of the problems—like courts viewing PSUs as an arm of the state or chronic over-employment and under-performance—aren’t really addressable, prime minister Modi’s only option is to either sell them or shut them.

A big reason for the delay in both, the unofficial explanation is, that records were not available—in the case of the Ashoka Hotel in the capital, it is well-known, when the Vajpayee government tried to sell it, it found it didn’t have the title deeds to the land. But now that this spadework has been done, can we expect FY18 to be the year of the great PSU cleanup? Selling small stakes in listed PSUs or listing profitable PSUs, as is being contemplated, certainly brings in the cash, but disguises the real problem. Had PSUs performed like their private sector counterparts over the past three years, keep in mind, their market capitalisation would have been Rs 30.6 lakh crore instead of Rs 20.7 lakh crore.

**The growing business of religion in India** 

 ______ 
Religious tourism is defined as going for a pilgrimage and it may or may not involve an overnight stay. Photo: HT

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee visiting the holy shrines at Kedarnath and Badrinath in Uttarakhand earlier this month, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat is optimistic about the state’s prospects in the new tourist season. How popular is religious tourism among Indians? Does religion or class affect the probability of people undertaking pilgrimages?

Studies conducted by Lokniti at the Delhi-based Centre for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) help us answer such questions. The studies show that nearly one in two Indians plan to undertake religious tourism in the next two years and a bigger number reported doing so in the past two years.

A study conducted by Lokniti on Religious attitudes, behaviour and practices in 2015 shows that a significant section of the population in all major religious groups in India reported having undertaken religious tourism over the past two years. Religious tourism is defined as going for a pilgrimage and it may or may not involve an overnight stay. There was significant inter-religious variation in prevalence of religious tourism though, with the figure being around three-fourth for Sikhs and one-third for Muslims and Christians.

Does class play a role in people undertaking religious tourism? Among Hindus, class does not seem to have any influence on religious tourism, but among Muslims, lower classes seem to have a slightly higher probability of undertaking pilgrimages. The results are based on Lokniti’s multi-dimensional economic class index which takes into account income, asset ownership, place of residence and occupation.

The popular perception that older people are more likely to go for pilgrimages seems to be slightly misplaced. Among Hindus, we find no age-based pattern as respondents from all age-groups were equally likely to have undertaken a pilgrimage. Among Muslims, those aged 56 years or above were relatively much more likely to have undertaken a pilgrimage. While there is no gender-based difference among Hindu pilgrims, Muslim men are more likely to undertake pilgrimages than women.

Given the rise in religiosity in the country, going for pilgrimages may increase in times to come. The same study also shows that more than 25% Indians reported having become more religious over the past 4-5 years. The trend is valid across religions and in keeping with other attitudinal surveys. Between 2007 and 2015, the share of respondents in India who perceived religion to be very important increased by 11 percentage points to 80%, according to the Pew Global Attitude surveys.

Religious places are ranked high in preferred tourist destinations for Indians, according to the State of Nation Study conducted by Lokniti in 2008, which found that 39% of the respondents reported pilgrimages/holy sites as their most preferred location for a vacation.

These findings, however, are slightly different from a National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report on domestic tourism for 2008-09. The report found that social purposes accounted for almost three-fourth of all overnight trips, while pilgrimages and religious trips accounted for only around one in 10 such trips in the year preceding the survey. Although the NSSO released a similar report in 2014-15, it can’t be compared with the Lokniti findings as NSSO figures are based on response for the last 30 days, against Lokniti’s period of past two years.

Nonetheless, the NSSO report does show that average expenditure on religious trips has more than doubled during this period, and it is ranked second in terms of average number of persons per household who go on such trips.

The broad trends seem to suggest that religious tourism should be accorded priority in India’s tourism policy.

This story is based on survey data shared exclusively with Mint. Pranav Gupta is a researcher with Lokniti CSDS and Sanjay Kumar is professor and currently director of CSDS

**From Afghan hideout, Kerala jihad leader calls faithful to Caliphate** 

 ______ 
Representational Image/ File Representational Image/ File

Fugitive preacher Abdul Rashid Abdulla, sought by the National Investigation Agency for leading 23 Kerala residents to join the Islamic State in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, says he is telling would-be jihadists to travel to the country instead of plotting attacks inside India. “Today, it is impossible to wage offensive jihad in India”, he said in an exclusive interview to the The Indian Express. “First, we have to consolidate the Caliphate, and then expand its frontiers”.

“Perhaps we can carry out one or two lone wolf attacks, or a strike here or there, but not true offensive jihad”, Abdulla said. “We have lots of people in India, and we tell them: wait, we are coming. The Islamic State is growing far faster than you can imagine. The aim is for the whole world to be ruled by the law of Allah, so he alone is worshipped, not false gods”.

The interview gives new insight into the thinking driving recruitment into the ranks of organisations like the Islamic State, which, though small, has swelled in recent years. “In India, the Modi government is a blessing in disguise for us”, he says. “This is because while, in some parts of India, Muslims face visible oppression, in many others, they really do not recognise the reality of their oppression. The hypocrite scholars misguide them. The Modi government is planning to change the Constitution and once that happens, the real oppression will begin”. “That is when Muslims will start searching for the solution”, Abdullah says. “People only remember God when a loved one is dying in hospital. Jihad is like that, too”.

Abdulla lashed out at mainstream Indian Muslim leaders who, he argued, were misleading their flock by condemning the Islamic State as illegitimate. “Muslim leaders in India claim that it is possible for Muslims to practise their faith 100% in India: we can pray, fast, go for hajj, and so on”, he said. “But the hypocrite Islamic scholars stay silent on the Quranic commandment for Muslims to engage in offensive jihad. They know that the Prophet went with weapons and conquered the whole of the Arabian peninsula. The Islamic State follows the example of the Prophet Muhammad in Medina, yet these so-called scholars criticise it”.

“Islam spread by the sword — not by peace”, Abdulla said. “The critics of Islam, ironically, speak the truth, while the so-called Islamic scholars do not. The Prophet Muhammad, the Caliph Abu Bakr Siddiq, and those that followed them, conquered the world by the sword, not by doing dawah [proselytisation]”.

Abdulla also insists other key religious obligations cannot be met in India, either. “To give but one example: forbidding evil is a critical part of Islam. Allah asks Muslims to prevent evil with their hand. In India, Hindus worship false gods everywhere. Is there any Muslim who can use his hand to stop this? There will be a riot. Alcoholism. Prostitution. Homosexuality. Interest. I can go on and on”.

Abdulla was also dismissive of arguments made by Muslim leaders that campaigning to improve the conditions of Muslims in India was more important than global jihad. “For a Muslim, the biggest objective should be a world ruled by the law of objective. Education, jobs-these are pseudo-achievements. Education in India teaches you to respect the nation-state, and other religions. These are anti-Islamic. And jobs? A job helps a secular-democratic nation. Is it Islamic to build a country where people can worship false gods all the better?”

“Indian Muslim leaders fall into three categories”, he alleged, “those who do not know the truth, those who deliberately obscure the truth, and those who realise the truth, but only wish to work for it indirectly, fearful of the consequences of speaking out”. Abdulla’s entry into the Islamic State appears to have been part of a long journey. “Following the September 11 attacks, any Muslim was delighted. I was in Muscat, preparing for my class 10 exams, it gave me a wonderful feeling. Later, the hypocrites of Islam, the so-called scholars in the pay of the United States, branded this to be terrorism”. He describes the Caliphate in Afghanistan as a kind of utopia: “There are a great many people from India migrating and coming here from almost every state, far more than you can imagine”.

Abdulla rejects claims that the Islamic State is hated by local tribes. “Here in Khorasan, we have Pakistanis, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Arabs, Russians, Indians — and all of us live like brothers, along with the Afghans from local tribes. The Islamic State was only resisted by some with nationalistic goals, or with secular ideology, who revolted against Islam and the Caliphate. They were executed. That news is true”. The Taliban, with whom the Islamic State has battled, he casts as misguided. “They implement sharia, but not 100% — they only want to capture Afghanistan, implement sharia in it, not in the whole world, as Allah commands us to do. This is anti-Islamic”. Ever greater numbers of Indian Muslims, Abdulla believes, will be drawn to jihad in the future.

“Thanks to western education, young people have come to realise the drawbacks of the western system. The youth have realised that western philosophy, and the western way of life, rests on shaky foundations. Some turn to atheism, and find themselves stuck in a spiritual vacuum. Thanks to the internet, though, and to their knowledge of English, a new world has opened up to the youth.”

New Delhi: India’s environment minister Anil Madhav Dave, an expert in river conservation and an environmentalist at heart, died on Thursday morning in the national capital after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was 60.

Dave, who became the minister for environment, forest and climate change last year, was working till Wednesday.

He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday evening, and was in office the whole day. On Wednesday morning, he met civil society groups protesting against genetically modified mustard crop.

He was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) early Thursday morning where he breathed his last. He was unmarried.

Modi tweeted and expressed shock at the sudden demise of the environment minister, calling it a personal loss.

Absolutely shocked by the sudden demise of my friend &amp; a very respected colleague, Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave ji. My condolences. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 18, 2017

I was with Anil Madhav Dave ji till late last evening, discussing key policy issues. This demise is a personal loss. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 18, 2017

“Absolutely shocked by the sudden demise of my friend and a very respected colleague, Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave ji. My condolences. Anil Madhav Dave ji will be remembered as a devoted public servant. He was tremendously passionate towards conserving the environment,” Modi tweeted.

The prime minister also said that he was with Dave till late Wednesday evening discussing key policy issues. “This demise is a personal loss,” the PM said.

President Pranab Mukherjee also tweeted, “Shocked by sudden demise of Union Environment Minister Shri Anil Dave; deepest condolences to his family &amp; well wishers.”

Dave had been keeping unwell since the past few months and was seen missing several programmes of the environment ministry and was absent from Parliament too on some occasions. However, according to his staff, he had recovered and was active from the last 10-15 days.

He was also scheduled to go to Coimbatore for official work on Thursday but the programme was cancelled on Wednesday night.

Dave became the environment minister last year on the eve of his birthday on 6 July, when the PM reshuffled his cabinet.

He used to cycle to Parliament but that changed when he became a minister.

Though he was an environmentalist and conservationist at heart, he vowed to strike a balance between development and environment soon after taking over.

Dave was a third-time Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament from Madhya Pradesh.

He was a former pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological parent, and used to identify himself as an “RSS swayamsewak” (volunteer) on his Twitter handle before he became minister.

Dave was a post-graduate from Gujarati College in Indore, and wrote eight books (in Hindi and English), including one on climate change called Beyond Copenhagen and another on freedom fighter Chandra Shekhar Azad.

He also earned praise for successfully organizing the World Hindi Conference in 2015.

Dave was also an active parliamentarian. Besides being a member of various parliamentary panels such as those on water resources and the consultative committee of the information and broadcasting ministry, Dave had also been chairman of the Select Committee on Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Bill, 2015, the Select Committee on the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2013, and the Select Committee on Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, 2013.

**RJD youth wing attacks BJP workers &amp; office in Patna**

A policeman chases an RJD worker in Patna Wednesday. PTI A policeman chases an RJD worker in Patna Wednesday. PTI

Over half a dozen BJP workers were injured in stone-throwing by more than 100 workers of RJD’s youth wing at the BJP’s office at Bir Chand Patel Path in Patna on Wednesday. The RJD youth wing workers were protesting the Income Tax raids at party chief Lalu Prasad’s premises in Delhi and Haryana on Tuesday.

While the BJP said the incident reflected “the RJD culture”, the RJD alleged that its youth wing workers could have been provoked by the BJP workers. An FIR has been lodged against unidentified RJD workers. The RJD, on its part, has filed a counter FIR. The incident took place around 11 am on Wednesday when about 100 workers of the RJD’s youth wing started a protest march from their party office, barely 350 m from the BJP office. Many of them were bare-chested and carrying lathis. On reaching the BJP office, they started raising slogans against PM Narendra Modi and BJP leader Sushil Modi. This provoked the BJP workers and some of them responded by shouting “Lalu Yadav murdabad”, triggering a clash.

As the RJD workers were larger in number, the BJP workers had to retreat for cover. The RJD youth wing members started throwing stones at the BJP office. They also damaged vehicles parked outside the office. The stone throwing continued for about 10 minutes before police were able to control the situation. The injured were hospitalised and discharged later.

BJP office secretary Lalit Yadav, on the basis of whose statement the FIR was lodged, said: “As we tried to come out of the office, the police stopped us. Police did not do anything to stop the RJD workers.”

Patna City SP Chandan Kushwaha said they were trying to identify people who engaged in a scuffle with the policemen.

Bihar BJP president Nityanand Rai said: “What happened reflected the RJD culture. This is nothing but a criminal mindset.”

Taking a dig at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said, “Nitishji ko Lalu ka saath pasand hai (Nitish Kumar likes the company of Lalu Prasad)…. He would not severe ties with RJD under any condition. The attack at our office happened in front of police, but they remained mute spectators.”

RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha said, “The youth wing members could have been provoked by the BJP workers.”

JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said, “All legal processes would be completed. Such action (of the RJD workers) does not have sanction in politics.”

**Economy growing at 7%, jobs at 1%** 

 ______ 
While the economy is growing at just over 7% per year, jobs increased by just 1.1% last year, according to a recently-released report covering eight key sectors of the non-farm economy. An earlier report had pegged joblessness at a fiveyear high of 5% in 2015, and under-employment at a staggering 35% of the over-15 years labour force.Seen in this context, the government is facing a growing employment crisis which its various initiatives are unable to address.Both reports are based on large surveys carried out by the Labour Bureau. Job growth is tracked by a revamped quarterly survey of over 10,000 units while unemployment is recorded in an annual survey of 7.8 lakh people. The new quarterly survey started in April 2016 and replaced an earlier one which covered certain export-oriented sectors. Providing decent jobs was one of the most popular promises which swept the Modi-led BJP to office in 2014 and helped it win several state elections.Most recently, Yogi Adityanath too had promised to address the jobs situation in UP after being anointed the chief minister following BJP's dramatic victory in the state assembly elections. UP itself has an estimated 1 crore unemployed, according to the report.Recent reports of several IT and BPO majors shedding jobs have added to the worries of people, especially urban middle-class families which had been riding the IT boom. Global slowdown in IT services and components and new visa restrictions are thought to be behind this.Several other indicators explain this painful situation. Gross credit given to industry has grown by just 6.7% in the past three years, the index of industrial production has inched up by just 6% and growth in gross fixed capital formation slipped to an alarmingly low 0.6% in January this year compared to 6.1% last year. A total of 2.3 lakh jobs were added to the eight sectors covered in the quarterly survey including manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation and restaurants, IT/BPO, education and health.Nearly half of the new jobs added were in education and health. Both these sectors are known for low paying jobs. Construction and the hospitality/food sectors showed loss of jobs, the most serious ones, amounting to a dip of nearly 7%, is in construction.One usually neglected aspect of India's unemployment crisis is of under-employment or concealed unemployment. This is of two types —not finding work for full year and work at very low wages. The Labour Bureau's 2016 report on unemployment paints a dire picture of both fronts.Only 61% of people in the workforce were found to have year-round jobs with 34% working only 6-11 months even though they were willing to work for 12 months. The report also revealed that 68% households were earning only Rs 10,000 per month or less. In all, nearly 16 crore people in the workforce were under-employed in this manner.

**'Public Duty. Any Citizen Would Have Done It': Harish Salve On Re 1 Fee** 

 ______ 
Harish Salve had led the battery of lawyers to structure India's case in the
UN court

**New Delhi: **

Former Attorney General Harish Salve, who famously charged only Re 1 to argue
India's case on Kulbhushan Jadhav in the International Court of Justice in The
Hague, today said he has done no more than what any Indian citizen would do.

""For me, this is not a commercial case... It was a public duty. Any citizen of
India would have done that... it was of no great moment,"" said Mr Salve, who
was feted on Thursday as the court gave a preliminary verdict in India's
favour. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in lauding Mr Salve, who
had represented India earlier in international forums as well. In a
conversation with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, PM Modi thanked Mr
Salve.

Ms Swaraj too praised Mr Salve's efforts. One of her several posts on Twitter
following the International Court's verdict read:

&gt; We are grateful to Mr.Harish Salve for presenting India's case so
effectively before ICJ.

&gt;

&gt; Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) May 18, 2017

  
Earlier this week, Ms Swaraj had defended Mr Salve on Twitter as someone took
a jibe at him. Mr Salve is one of the most expensive lawyers in the country.
But Ms Swaraj had pointed out that for this case, he was taking a fee of only
1 rupee.  
  
""I thought Sushma-ji was angry with someone so she tweeted it,"" Mr Salve told
NDTV.  

He also related how Ms Swaraj had led the operation ""from the front"".

The foreign minister, he said, had called him in April after he had suggested
that India consider the option of approaching the International Court of
Justice in an interview with NDTV. The minister, he said, was ""personally
looking at every step"" and the planning was done in complete secrecy which
gave India an edge.

**Highway projects worth Rs 5 lakh crore planned in 2 years** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government has set an ambitious target of awarding Rs 5 lakh crore worth of highway contracts, totalling about 50,000 km, in the last two years of its tenure, surpassing the cumulative road length awarded for paying in the last five years.Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari told ET that the contracts will be for 44 economic corridors and 10 expressways, and would include the 'chardham' connectivity programme, northeast connectivity programme and the borders-linking projects. Over the last five years, the government could award only 40,000 km of fresh highway length for construction.""We have planned several projects that would be very crucial for overall development of the country. These new highways would decongest the existing roads, bringing down logistics cost by 5-6%,” Gadkari told ET. ""My ministry's vision is that a freight vehicle should move on highways without restrictions and should be able to do at least 400 km per day. It will have very positive impact on the logistics industry.”At present, there are 10 expressway projects at various stages of implementation. Gadkari said his ministry would raise money through NHAI bonds, monetisation of highways and additional allocation in budgetary support. He said the Centre's first expressway, the Eastern peripheral expressway, would be ready in a few months.Most of these projects would be undertaken on the hybrid annuity model, where the government shares the project risk with the private partner and bears 40% of the project cost upfront.Of the 50,000 km of road length that will be awarded for construction, paving work for 30,000 km of highways will start in the last two years, the ministry has said.This fiscal, the government is targeting construct of almost 15,000 km of highways, up 45% from what it achieved in FY17. Over the last three years, the ministry has awarded contracts for over 34,000 km of roads as compared with 15,000 km awarded by the UPA government in its last three years.Actual construction in the last three years has been about 22,000 km as compared with 6,000 km during the last three years of the UPA government.

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**Rajinikanth keeps guessing game on over his political plunge** 

 ______

Chennai: Will he or won’t he is the million dollar question in the minds of common man in Tamil Nadu on prospects of ‘Superstar’ Rajinikanth taking the political plunge.

With stalwarts like late Jayalalithaa and ailing Nonagenarian DMK supremo M.Karunanidhi out of the picture in the current dispensation, Rajinikanth’s fans believe he is the only one who can effectively fill the political vacuum.

Rajinikanth’s latest ambivalent statements on the possibility of his political entry has triggered a buzz in various circles, though this is not for the first time. Such a hysteria was witnessed even in 1996 when he openly defied Jayalalithaa, asking people not to vote for her.

The then hustings saw ‘Amma’ losing the assembly elections and the DMK-TMC registering a landslide victory. Having had his run-ins with the powers that be in the past, the actor has come a long way from his first outburst in 1996 when he said “even God can’t save Tamil Nadu” if AIADMK was elected again.

In the ensuing political developments, he backed the DMK-TMC (Tamil Maanila Congress, led by the late G K Moopanar) combine, which also cashed in on the severe anti-incumbency against the ruling AIADMK.

However, the combine could not keep the momentum on as AIADMK staged a good comeback in the 1998 Parliamentary polls.

In the meantime, the actor continued to give some hints of a political entry in his ‘Baba’ (2002), which also saw Dr S Ramadoss-founded PMK go up in arms against his on screen smoking.

In the film, dealing with the protagonist’s transformation from a carefree atheist to a believer, the plot details the actor’s brush with a wily politician.

In the film, Rajinikanth bats for a particular clean politician but soon after the man is killed, the actor is shown approaching the people, hinting he would lead them.

The film also enraged Ramadoss,who accused Rajinikanth of misleading the youth with his unique cigarette flinching style, among other gimmicks. However, whenever his fans have been vocal or proactive about his political plunge, the actor has either remained silent or distanced himself away from the topic.

Twice his supporters and actors have come out in the open floating some ‘party’ or ‘outfit’ in a bid to pressure Rajini, as he is fondly called, to enter politics . It is not uncommon for his fans across the state to frequently put up posters urging him to come and ‘lead’ and ‘save’ Tamil Nadu.

Even party flags had been launched by some fans in the past, but the actor had either remained silent or distanced himself away from fans who resorted to such actions.

Many political parties, barring AIADMK, had been wooing him. However, he was on good terms with Jayalalithaa in the recent past and had even rued he had ‘hurt’ her back in 1996 by being critical of her.

In his latest comments, Rajinikanth had said he had no desire to joins politics, but if he did, he would show the door to all “money-minded” people. He was often dragged into political debates despite stressing that he was “neither an influential political leader nor a social activist.” “My name has been dragged into politics for the past two decades. I am pushed to clarify during every election that I’m not affiliated to any political party,” he had said early this week.

Incidentally, in his film Muthu (1995), he mouthed lyrics in a song saying “why should I launch a party now, (but) its only time will tell that.”

Tamil cinema has always had close links with politics, with matinee idols, the late MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa, besides script writer M Karunanidhi, having gone to rule the state. Ramachandran, in particular, was seen as one converting his huge popularity into a springboard for his political launch, which was as successful as his cinema career.

Rajini fans are eagerly waiting to see if their ‘Thalaivar’ (Leader) will do an encore like MGR.

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose top leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi are said to enjoy good relations with the ‘superstar’, has welcomed the idea of the actor joining their fold. “We welcome if he comes to politics. We will also welcome if he comes (joins) to BJP,” state BJP leader and Union minister of state Pon Radhakrishnan said recently.

Incidentally, Modi met Rajinikant at his Poes Garden residence in 2014 when he visited Chennai.

Of course, a good deal of questionable activities does probably take place at the party level to amass funds for fighting elections and all (of which he keeps himself uninformed, plausible deniability and all), and active interference in other parties' state governments to hurt their electoral chances, but I doubt he lets his ministers have that much leeway to stuff their pockets just for the sake of it.",2017-05-19 18:20:04

182,"&gt; Let's wait for the skeletons to come out, then.

Yes, let's not pronounce right away that scams have reduced a lot.

Personally, I also feel Sonia, Rahul Gandhi etc aren't in it for petty things like money - they don't seem like corrupt individuals. That's why in stuff like 2G scam etc, you mostly found only the allies and not anyone from Congress. And even in other scams - till now noone other than Kalmadi has been proven to be guilty. 

That aside even if this is true for both Sonia &amp; Modi, the kind of money needed for fighting elections makes their personal reasons almost irrelevant. It's said that both Congress and BJP each spent at least spent 15,000 crores each in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This kind of money will not come without huge, systemic corruption. And the reason politicians indulge in such corruption is because it's a highly profitable gig. Also each candidate pays to get a ticket for all elections unless he is a celebrity or a guaranteed winner. Now this money also has to be recovered. Plus when politicians are being corrupt for party reasons or ticket reasons, they are taking a personal risk there. Once they have taken that risk, it's not possible that they make money for themselves.",2017-05-19 18:46:09

This is news. It used to get reported back then. Now, Modiji has complete control over Main Stream Modia - Moditutes will no longer publish news which may harm BJP's election prospects. But back then, his grip on modia wasn't so tight.

Even, Sir David H Gilani who is generally considered in terrorist circles to be very pure &amp; honest &amp; has never been known to lie didn't say she is a terrorist. He said that a 3rd party told him that some 4th party had told the 3rd party. This is called hearsay - will not even be admitted in the court of law.

**Ganga cleaning drive: Sewage treatment capacity enhanced in towns along river** 

 ______ 
The sewage treatment capacity in towns along the Ganga is being enhanced substantially as part of efforts to clean the river, a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was told. The meeting on Modi’s ambitious programme ‘Namaami Gange’ was also informed that intensive monitoring and inspection of the grossly-polluting industries has been taken up, which has led to “considerable improvement” in the water quality of some of the tributaries of the river, a PMO statement said.

Senior officials from various government departments made presentations on the programme and apprised the prime minister of action taken and the progress made on it, it said.

According to the statement, the officials said the sewage treatment capacity in towns along the river is being enhanced substantially and considerable focus is being placed on large cities like Haridwar, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Howrah and Kolkata. “Intensive monitoring and inspection of the grossly-polluting industries has been taken up,” the statement said.

“The officials said that this has led to considerable improvement in the water quality of some of the tributaries of the river Ganga,” it added. Parameters such as “dissolved oxygen” and “biochemical oxygen demand” have been studied as part of this assessment, the meeting was told last evening.

The prime minister was also apprised of the considerable progress made in rural sanitation in villages along the banks of the river Ganga, the statement said. Modi stressed on the need to further increase public awareness and participation in the task of cleaning the river.

The meeting was attended by top officials from the PMO, NITI Aayog, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, National Mission for Clean Ganga and Central Pollution Control Board.

The meeting on ‘Namaami Gange’ assumed significance as it was the first since the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the river’s two key basin states whose previous governments were accused by the Centre of not cooperating fully.

**Forces Have Rights Too, Says Kiren Rijiju On Human Shield Used In Kashmir** 

 ______ 
Kiren Rijiju said it was ""very sad"" that Indian forces had to face attacks
from across the border.

**New Delhi: **

In a freewheeling interview with NDTV to mark three years of the Narendra Modi
government, Junior Home Minister Kiren Rijiju, asked about the challenges in
Kashmir, admitted that there are ""problems"".

On whether it could be jotted down in the ""fail"" column for the BJP-led
government on its third anniversary, Mr Rijiju said, ""It's the reason why we
have separate wings in the ministry to deal only with Kashmir or only with
Northeast. It's because these areas need special attention. We do have
problems but I can say that in the last three years we have improved a lot,
like in securing our border areas.""

The minister said it was ""very sad"" that Indian security forces had to face
attacks from across the border. Asked about India's response to recent
provocations from Pakistan, including ceasefire violations, terror attacks and
the mutilation of two soldiers by Pakistanis, Mr Rijiju said, ""I can't say
much but try and understand what I am trying to say. We can do things like
surgical strikes but we can't talk about it. We also have to present our case
to international forums and our soldiers are bound by political decisions. I
can only assure you that this government is very supportive of our forces.''

The friction, however, between the forces and the people of Kashmir was
evident in recent videos that were in wide circulation in the Valley. In one
video, CRPF or Central Reserve Police Force personnel were pushed, abused and
harassed by local people as they walked with EVMs or vote machines after by-
polls in Srinagar.

Another video showed

a protester strapped to the front of an army jeep

by personnel as a shield against stone-throwers on the same day. The man, a
weaver, had come to vote in the by-polls.

The state police are yet to complete their assessment of that incident but Mr
Rijiju said the soldiers did nothing wrong.

""It is very sad that our forces have to face such things in their own country.
They are portrayed as villainous and defamed. There are many things that
security forces do but they are always charged with violations of human
rights. We want to show that we treat Kashmiris as our own but it isn't right
that they are always attacked and die for their country. This isn't right for
the country. So, this is a delicate issue.""

When NDTV asked specifically if he supported the use of a human shield, he
said, ""I can't speak because if I do, it makes it a matter of policy and
government stance. But there were circumstances which had to be decided on the
spot. If it is a question of protecting your own life, you may adopt means.
You have human rights but security forces also have human rights.""

**GST rates: Services to have 4 slabs; education, healthcare exempted** 

 ______ 
The GST (Goods and Services Tax) Council on Friday finalised tax rates for services. Education and healthcare have been exempted from the GST regime ""India has finalised four tax rates that will apply to services including telecoms, insurance, hotels and restaurants under a new sales tax which should be rolled out on July 1,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.The tax rates will be 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent - in line with those applying to goods. Telecoms and financial services will be taxed at a standard rate of 18% while transport services will be taxed at 5%, Jaitley told reporters after a meeting of the GST Council in Srinagar.The tax rate on gold has not been finalised yet and the Council will meet again on June 3.The new tax rates would affect everything from your restaurant visits, movie dates, visits to the salon and even your phone bills. Rail, air and road transport will fall in the 5 percent tax slab. Non air-conditioned restaurants will attract a tax levy of 12 per cent whereas air-conditioned restaurants will fall in the 18 per cent tax bracket. Hotels with tariff between Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 will attract a GST of 18 per cent, whereas hotels with tariff of above Rs 5,000 will fall under the 28 per cent tax slab. However, hotels with tariff under Rs 1,000 are exempt from the GST regime.""Services, which are at currently taxed 15 per cent will be fitted into the 18 per cent bracket. However, services will get the benefit of input tax credit for the goods used, so real incidence of taxation will be lower than the headline rate,"" Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said after the GST council meeting. "" Luxury services "" would attract the highest rate of 28 per cent, he added.The Council on Thursday approved the tax rates for 1,211 items, of which 7 per cent will be exempted, 14 per cent will be in the 5 per cent slab, 17 per cent in the 12 per cent category, 43 per cent in the 18 per cent segment, while 19 per cent of goods will go into the top tax bracket of 28 per cent.""Telecom services would continue to be taxed at the same rates of the past. Not in a single case has there been an increase in taxes from before,"" the Kerala finance minister said.81 per cent items will attract tax of 18 per cent or below, while 19 per cent of items will be taxed at the highest rate of 28 per cent.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley yesterday said that while the overall basket of taxes will see a reduction, he hoped for greater tax buoyancy because of greater efficiency and less tax evasion.""On many commodities there would be reduction because of the cascading effect, but we are banking on the hope that because of a better tax system and less evasion there would be tax buoyancy,"" Jaitley said.The rate for capital goods, as well as industrial and intermediate items have been set at 18 per cent.The government aims to roll out GST from July 1. It is expected to add 2 per cent to the country's GDP or gross domestic product.""The net effect of Goods and Services Tax will not be inflationary,"" Jaitley said on Friday after the GST meeting. The new tax is likely to be non-inflationary as the government has kept a majority of food items, with a combined weighting of nearly 50 per cent in the consumer price index, out of the tax net.Basic food items like cereals, eggs and meat will attract zero tax while processed food items will be charged between 12 and 28 per cent.The long-awaited GST has been hailed as India's biggest tax overhaul since Independence in 1947. ""GST regime will usher in lower taxes, seamless input tax credit, logistics savings and market share swings from unorganised to organised players,"" said Aditya Narain, Research head at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who completes three years of his term this month, had said the new tax will not cause price rises, while aiming to bring down tax leakages in the complex tax system.(With agency inputs)

**For Kulbhushan Jadhav, India Has Plan A And B: Harish Salve To NDTV** 

 ______ 
Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: Senior lawyer Harish Salve represented India at
International Court of Justice.

**New Delhi: **

The first battle won at the International Court of Justice - the stalling of
the execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav - former Solicitor General

Harish Salve

said India has two plans to get justice for the 46-year-old former Naval
officer. The first involves a request for outright release amid what he called
an ""evolving jurisprudence"". The other -- a longer route that goes through
Pakistani courts.

""The international court is not a court of appeal where we show his
innocence,"" Mr Salve told NDTV. ""It is a court where we say the procedure
which Pakistan had adopted to arrive at this death sentence violates the
principles of Vienna Convention which is a multilateral treaty.""

One of the leading legal brains in the country, Mr Salve had not only led the
battery of lawyers to structure India's case, but also made a nearly one-and-
a-half-hour presentation at the International court in The Hague earlier this
week. Yesterday, the court agreed to the contentions and asked Pakistan to
hold off the execution of Mr Jadhav till it reached its final verdict.

Accepting India's contention, the court also said

Pakistan had illegally withheld consular access to Mr Jadhav

, whom it accused of spying. The Vienna Convention has provisions for consular
access to accused even in cases of terror and espionage, the court said.

Talking of the road ahead, Mr Salve said the Plan A is the option to argue
that such ""eggregious violation of human rights must compel the man being
released"". The senior advocate, however, said it is an option that only
""adventurous lawyers like me"" would try.

Mr Jadhav, who, India says was abducted from Iran where he was running a
business, has been in the custody of Pakistan since March. He has been on the
death row and incommunicado. India, Mr Salve said, can argue that he has
suffered enough and deserves to be released.

The other option, he said, was to demand for an annulment of the death
sentence. ""Get him proper legal representation and then let him be tried in a
manner acceptable to civilised society,"" he said. ""I am satisfied today that
court has accepted most of which we put forth,"" Mr Salve added.

India saw yesterday's interim order as a significant win

. Pakistan however, said it had ""not changed the status of Jadhav's case in
any manner"". Pakistan's Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf Ali's office said they
were determined to take the case to ""its logical end"".

After the verdict, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted, ""I assure the
nation that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we will
leave no stone unturned to save Kulbhushan Jadhav.""

**NCERT Class 12 textbooks won’t describe 2002 Gujarat riots as ‘anti-Muslim’** 

 ______ 
The 2002 Gujarat carnage will no longer be called “anti-Muslim riots” in NCERT textbooks and will be instead referred to as the “Gujarat riots” to describe one of the worst communal violence in India since Independence.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the course review committee that includes representatives of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the National Council of Educational Research And Training (NCERT), sources said.

The change will be made in a Class 12 textbook, published in 2007 during the Congress-led UPA government’s tenure.

According to official estimates, nearly 800 Muslims and more than 250 Hindus were killed in the violence in February-March, 2002, and is considered one of the worst communal riots in the country since Independence. The violence was sparked by the death of 57 Hindu pilgrims who were burnt alive in a train compartment at a station in Godhra.

The move could rile the minority community that bore the brunt of the weeks-long violence. Over the past three years, changes in textbooks have been a controversial issue. Several BJP-ruled states, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Maharashtra, tweaked schoolbooks in a way that triggered opposition allegations that these governments were trying to saffronise education.

The NCERT – the government’s think thank on school education -- termed the move a routine to keep textbooks updated.

“Points raised by CBSE have already been taken up by NCERT. Changes will be made and it will be reflected once the book is reprinted by the end of the year,” a senior NCERT official told HT seeking anonymity.

“This review is an ongoing process and before every reprint we do incorporate new acceptable feedback and also update the information. This year we are doing it in a more planned and comprehensive manner.”

The official also said the NCERT is carrying out a review of all textbooks to ensure that the latest developments are included.

A chapter titled “Politics in India since Independence” (page 187) in the Class XII political science textbook has a passage under the heading “Anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat”.

“In February-March 2002, large-scale violence against Muslims took place in Gujarat …. A bogey of a train that was returning from Ayodhya and was full of karsevaks was set on fire... Suspecting the hands of Muslims in setting fire to the bogey, large-scale violence against Muslims began in many parts of Gujarat...” the passage reads.

It also talks about the National Human Rights Commission criticising the Gujarat government’s role in failing to control violence and provide relief to victims. Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat at that time.

Sources said the meeting decided to change only the subtitle, as of now. HT has a copy of the minutes of the meeting.

Besides NCERT and CBSE representatives, teachers of some private schools also attended the review meeting on May 11 in Delhi. The CBSE reviewed the book on its own and sent a report to the NCERT following which the meeting was called, the sources added.

In a separate development on May 13, the NCERT also decided to replace the map of East and South East Asia in the same textbook that showed ‘Aksai Chin’, an area in Kashmir under China’s control, as a disputed area.

**Security to Vadra’s mother: Congress says govt should explain** 

 ______ 
The Congress on Wednesday suggested that it was for the Modi government to explain why the mother of Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, was being provided security, which has become a matter of controversy.

The opposition party said the NDA government had provided security to individuals with “interesting backgrounds”, including industrialists, powerful corporate brokers and politicians, and demanded that the list of such people be released.

“It is very interesting that Mr Modi has been in the government for 36 months now and there have been umpteen times when he could have reduced the security (provided to Vadra’s mother),” Congress spokesperson Ajoy Kumar said.

He was responding when asked to comment on a media report which said that six Delhi Police personnel have been deployed for the last 13 years at Vadra’s family home in the posh New Friends Colony where his mother Maureen Vadra resides.

“Unless there is a security perception, why is the Modi government continuing the security to her in the first place,” Kumar asked.

He told the journalists to find about the people who are getting government security, wondering if the Modi government was continuing such benefits “according to the set processes”.

“If the government releases the list of all people who have been given security in the past 36 months one could get an interesting list of industrialists, powerful corporate brokers and politicians with very interesting background,” the Congress spokesman said.

He said the government has decided that politician Amar Singh and yoga guru and businessman Baba Ramdev get security along with protection to the latter’s factory.

Kumar claimed the government has also provided security to a number of industrialists and sought to know who they are.

Earlier in the day, Vadra hit out at the media over the report.

“Really!! We have to stoop to the levels of now demeaning and harassing, elderly people...With all respect, please stop going after my mother...,” Vadra said in a Facebook post.

“Please remove my security and anything provided for me... no matter what the assessment, I will take every risk in the book, but lets have some level of decorum....Journalism at the worst I’ve seen,” he said.

**Uttar Pradesh: Yogi Adityanath saves Muslim youths life, funds his cancer treatment at AIIMS** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Yogi Adityanath saw Shadab lying on the hospital bed while inspecting a college.

2 He ordered the preparation of a file of Shadab's condition for referral at AIIMS.

3 Within 3 days of the CM's instructions, Shadab's file was shifted to AIIMS.

An ailing Muslim youth from Mantola, Agra had no hopes of surviving until he met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently. 25-year-old Shadab is suffering from Lymphoma or blood cancer. He was given a new lease of life by the chief minister after he ordered the state government to bear the cost of his treatment.

According to Shadab's mother Fatima (name changed), Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath saw Shadab lying on the hospital bed while inspecting the SN Medical College on May 7.

He inquired about Shadab's condition and found out that his family was unable to afford the advanced treatment required at AIIMS.

Following which, Yogi Adityanath ordered the preparation of a file of Shadab's condition for a referral at AIIMS and the best possible treatment for him in Agra until then.

Within three days of the Chief Minister's instructions, Shadab's file was prepared and he was shifted to AIIMS with the assistance of a local NGO Help Agra.

Fatima said that she was highly grateful to the chief minister for providing her son with the chance to live a healthy and disease-free life.

Commenting on Yogi's act of compassion, social activist Vishal Sharma said that what the chief minister did for Shadab was highly appreciable, but it should not be seen as something done by a Hindu chief minister for a Muslim youth.

""Yogi Adityanath has been elected as the Chief Minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh, which includes its Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and followers of other faiths. At this constitutional portfolio, what the chief minister has done for Shadab should only be seen as an act of compassion by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for a citizen of the state. To see it in any other light would demean the whole act,"" Sharma added.

Hotelier and social activist Arun Dang too appreciated the chief minister's move to help Shadab fight the deadly disease and said that saffron clothes do not mean that the chief minister would only work for Hindus and neither does wearing a skull cap mean that the chief minister would only work for Muslims.

""Being on such an important portfolio in itself means that the chief minister can have no differentiation between the citizens in his mind. Chief Minister Yogi is only following what Prime Minister Modi has already stated, that the country is one and every Indian is the same, irrespective of his or her faith,"" Arun Dang said.

Hindustani Biradari Secretary Ziauddin said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has done nothing but follow Prime Minister Modi's 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' slogan. He added that Yogi Aditynath's act shows that there is no difference between what he says and what he does.

The GST () Council on Friday finalised tax rates for services. Education and healthcare have been exempted from the GST regime ""India has finalised four tax rates that will apply to services including telecoms, insurance, hotels and restaurants under a new sales tax which should be rolled out on July 1,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said.The tax rates will be 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent - in line with those applying to goods. Telecoms and financial services will be taxed at a standard rate of 18% while transport services will be taxed at 5%, Jaitley told reporters after a meeting of the GST Council in Srinagar.The tax rate on gold has not been finalised yet and the Council will meet again on June 3.from your restaurant visits, movie dates, visits to the salon and even your phone bills. Rail, air and road transport will fall in the 5 percent tax slab. Non air-conditioned restaurants will attract a tax levy of 12 per cent whereas air-conditioned restaurants will fall in the 18 per cent tax bracket. Hotels with tariff between Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 will attract a GST of 18 per cent, whereas hotels with tariff of above Rs 5,000 will fall under the 28 per cent tax slab. However, hotels with tariff under Rs 1,000 are exempt from the GST regime.""Services, which are at currently taxed 15 per cent will be fitted into the 18 per cent bracket. However, services will get the benefit of input tax credit for the goods used, so real incidence of taxation will be lower than the headline rate,"" Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said after the GST council meeting. "" Luxury services "" would attract the highest rate of 28 per cent, he added.The Council on Thursday approved the tax rates for 1,211 items, of which 7 per cent will be exempted, 14 per cent will be in the 5 per cent slab, 17 per cent in the 12 per cent category, 43 per cent in the 18 per cent segment, while 19 per cent of goods will go into the top tax bracket of 28 per cent.""Telecom services would continue to be taxed at the same rates of the past. Not in a single case has there been an increase in taxes from before,"" the Kerala finance minister said.81 per cent items will attract tax of 18 per cent or below, while 19 per cent of items will be taxed at the highest rate of 28 per cent.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley yesterday said that while the overall basket of taxes will see a reduction, he hoped for greater tax buoyancy because of greater efficiency and less tax evasion.""On many commodities there would be reduction because of the cascading effect, but we are banking on the hope that because of a better tax system and less evasion there would be tax buoyancy,"" Jaitley said.The rate for capital goods, as well as industrial and intermediate items have been set at 18 per cent.The government aims to roll out GST from July 1. It is expected to add 2 per cent to the country's GDP or gross domestic product.""The net effect of Goods and Services Tax will not be inflationary,"" Jaitley said on Friday after the GST meeting. The new tax is likely to be non-inflationary as the government has kept a majority of food items, with a combined weighting of nearly 50 per cent in the consumer price index, out of the tax net.Basic food items like cereals, eggs and meat will attract zero tax while processed food items will be charged between 12 and 28 per cent.The long-awaited GST has been hailed as India's biggest tax overhaul since Independence in 1947. ""GST regime will usher in lower taxes, seamless input tax credit, logistics savings and market share swings from unorganised to organised players,"" said Aditya Narain, Research head at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who completes three years of his term this month, had said the new tax will not cause price rises, while aiming to bring down tax leakages in the complex tax system.(With agency inputs)

**Indo-African bilateral trade will touch $100 billion by 2018: AfDB** 

 ______ 
Ahmedabad: The bilateral trade between India and Africa is expected to touch $100 billion by 2018, according to said Akinwumi A. Adesina, president, African Development Bank (AfDB).

He was speaking at a press conference in Ahmedabad ahead of the five-day annual meeting of the bank which is scheduled to be held at Mahatma Mandir Convention Centre in Gandhinagar from Monday.

This is the first time that the annual meetings of AfDB are being held in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be participating in the inaugural session. Finance minister Arun Jaitley will chair the meeting of board of governors.

The annual meetings are the bank’s largest annual event and serve to raise the profile of the institution on the global stage, according to a media release by the foreign ministry. In addition to the annual meeting of the board of governors, these meetings will bring together about 3,000 delegates and participants, and will feature a number of official and side events, it said.

“The bilateral trade between India and Africa was $11.7 billion in 2005-06 and this has reached $56.9 billion by 2015-16. Now we expect the bilateral trade to exceed $100 billion in the next two years,” Adesina said, while lauding Modi for his efforts to strengthen the Indo-African relationship.

At the India-Africa Forum Summit 2015, Modi announced a $10 billion line of credit that marked a new approach to engagement with African countries. This not only helped finance the projects in African countries but have also contributed to capacity-building and education.

India is the fifth-biggest investor in Africa, with investments over the past 20 years amounting to $54 billion or 19.2% of Africa’s foreign direct investment. Pharmaceuticals, ICT and services, the automobile sector and the power sector are likely to be major contributors to the bilateral trade between the two countries in the next two years, Adesina said.

AfDB has adopted a strategy called “High 5s” that focuses on five major social developmental initiatives including energy, industrialization, regional connectivity, agriculture and improved quality of life. The Indian government has also organized an “India-Africa Dialogue” in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), where the sessions will broadly inform Indian companies about the bank’s “High 5s” agenda.

On the sidelines of the annual meeting, an event pertaining to the International Solar Alliance (ISA) has also been organized by the government. At the event, the framework agreement of the ISA would be kept open for signature, and India would also accept ratification documents from those countries that have completed the ratification process. So far, 25 countries have signed the ISA’s framework agreement while many other countries including Ghana, Mauritius, Yemen and Somalia have agreed to do so.

ISA, an initiative by Modi, was launched in November 2015 at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Speaking about the solar sector, Adesina said that Africa has potential to generate 11 terawatts of solar-generated power.

“Africa cannot develop in the dark and we need to light up Africa…We want to connect 130 million people to the grid, 75 million people to off-grid systems and lot of that is going to be by solar power. African Development Bank is leading the solar revolution in the African continent,” he said, while adding that he believed that the ISA would work closely with AfDB for developing solar power projects in Africa.

AfDB has also set up a fund called the Facility for Energy Inclusion worth $500 million to fund small and medium-scale businesses in off-grid renewable energy.

“Through this fund, we will invest anywhere between $3-30 million dollars in companies that are setting up renewable energy projects with a capacity to generate below 30 megawatts of power,” he said.

To address the inadequate electrification in the African continent, Adesina said that AfDB is looking to invest $12 billion over the next five years and this could go up to $34 billion by 2025-26. This would leverage investment to the tune of $45-50 billion from the private sector, he added.

What do you think Beijing's reaction will be? Will Xi send representatives to provide legitimacy to India-OBOR, or will Xi do the same thing as Modi did, and find some reason to not attend? Afterall, if OBOR is an initiative unlike AIIB, then the Chinese will have no problems attending an Indian initiative. But I doubt it. 

You are right in that the talk about the OBOR going through disputed areas is just a smokescreen. The actual reason is that OBOR is viewed as a Chinese initiative, and its success will show that China, like America, is capable of leading a world changing initiative. Simply put, the Indian establishment is upset that the Chinese came up with OBOR with little consultation with India. Nobody associates OBOR with India. That is the problem. 

China could have avoided this problem by promoting this as a joint India-China project, the two giants of the world coming together. Give Modi a platform to give a couple of nice speeches, have a few ads that show India prominently, and nobody in India will complain.

Yes. 

And reading that one gets how petty and childish it is. Its so clear to see.  

Hence the only reason for your hypothetical scenario to be valid would be if China also had similar levels of strategic amnesia as India has demonstrated?  

But are we also talking about China being less developed than India in this hypothetical?  
If so its beginning to sound like a complete role reversal in every sense of the word.  

But i'll indulge.  
I would still say China would come. 

Reason, because in this hypothetical we can only use things which have happened for our statement to have merit.  
And on my statement regarding China coming and being a part of it (capacity can vary because even for Indian participant in BRF the point that was made was, at least send someone if not the PM himself) is valid because China did exactly that with the rest of the world.  

It did so with US and US is a far bigger hegemon than China is to India. Plus greater security and strategic issues when China was intent on playing the second fiddle to US and the West.  

Not just that, even Japan more so than US is in this picture. The 80's and early 90's in China is what can in broad generalized equation be termed Japanese economic subsistence (with Taiwan, HK and Singapore/Malaysian Chinese contributing).  And Japan-China is nothing like China-India. In fact its even worse than Pakistan-India in some way. 

Meaning China has no problem with taking money from anyone as long as it gets shit done which helps it. This is not childish, its something which isn't talked about enough when discussing China, the level of pragmatism China shows is scary, for me its one of its greatest assets.  

India is not being pragmatic. Its objection is on bad merit, if it was on serious grounds, it would be easier to digest non-participation. But that just isn't so here.  

&gt; China could have avoided this problem by promoting this as a joint India-China project, the two giants of the world coming together. Give Modi a platform to give a couple of nice speeches, have a few ads that show India prominently, and nobody in India will complain.

We don't know what was happening behind the scene. Ideally it would have been welcome and best case. India-China being together on any issue is basically debate over on the matters.  

Basically the timeline of all this is, its a Xi driven thing. Xi took personal offense to Obama's statement in 2013 that China is a freeloader in the world (in economic and other sense). 2 weeks later Xi announced the beginning of this vision and said even freeloaders are welcome.   

So for China in strategic terms India being there or not maybe wasn't an issue(in the near term because they conclude India will eventually join, which is what i feel will happen as well), in practical/logistical terms it certainly is an issue for obvious reasons. But we don't know how India reacted to this, India was on pretty good momentum till even 2012 in regards to its multiple corridors.  
I don't think we need to over-complicate things and just go with the simplest analysis here and that is the quote you wrote above. Its straight and simple and it trends into the reality much more smoothly than other interpretations. 

Maybe a AIIB like mega share to India might have helped but then again, OBOR wasn't/isn't a bank, how would that even work. The EU supposedly also mentioned lack of co-ownership. Maybe China did play hardball but how much, what was the hypothetical share India was supposed to get, given that this is a massively multilateral initiative.  
Couldn't India just get things regarding its Port development, the DCIM alternative to CPEC, the BCIM and Indo-China peninsular developments.  
India is already commitment to these in one capacity or another, so even if the argument is China wasn't giving India much room, even that little is enough from 0.  
Why not use Chinese money for India's gains. Why should India be the one to spend everything from its own pocket when all this Infra is multi-use, meaning once made, neither India not China would have exclusive use. Once Chabahar is done, Iran can use it for a lot of things. Same with other of these projects.  
And we haven't even touched Africa.  

Point being. Even if the pie offered was tiny. Its still a pie. And you can increase your initial small share when inside the party not by being outside. ",2017-05-21 00:06:08

It is not hypocrisy. Even Congress ruled states did not agree with the form of GST which was proposed by Chidambaram. All manufacturing states rejected the idea of GST because their states will lose revenue and asked for compensation or some changes to the GST. Modi did not agree because Gujarat was also a manufacturing state. After BJP came into power Arun Jaitley agreed to most of the terms of Manufacturing state and all states got onboard with GST. Chidambaram was stubborn and he wanted everything under GST like petroleum products.

You can argue about whether GST will be successful or not in present form but you definitely cannot blame BJP for delay because TN,AP, Maharastra, Karnataka, Gujarat and many other states did not accept GST in its initial form.

Learn economic policies before speaking of bills like GST.

**Fifth Column: Three red flags** 

 ______ 
The third red flag I want to raise on this third anniversary is that there are no signs yet of the economic boom that people like me believed would happen as soon as Modi became Prime Minister. The third red flag I want to raise on this third anniversary is that there are no signs yet of the economic boom that people like me believed would happen as soon as Modi became Prime Minister.

There has been such a deluge of gratuitous scrutiny of Narendra Modi’s performance as he passes the anniversary of his third year in office that you are probably sick of reading report cards. I am. Sadly it is as impossible for a political columnist to ignore this third anniversary as it would be for a film critic to avoid reviewing Baahubali 2. But, I am going to spice things up by highlighting three serious failures instead of subjecting you to another tedious omnibus analysis.

There have been in my humble opinion serious failures in three areas. Of these, I believe the absence of a new education policy is the biggest failure of all. The higher education system Modi inherited was a mess created by regulators who have used their immense powers to create a licence raj. It will not be easy to rid Indian education of the University Grants Commission (UGC) or the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), or the other regulators that hide behind other acronyms, but it has to be done.

Only when universities and colleges are given the right to decide their own courses and rules will we see real change. Instead of doing this, Modi’s first HRD Minister spent her time trying to destroy the vice-chancellor of Delhi University for reasons unknown. Dinesh Singh was among the handful of academics who had shown initiative in bleak realms of academia, made bleaker by regulation. The Prime Minister got rid of Smriti Irani but the man who replaced her has shown no taste for ‘parivartan’ so it has not happened. And young Indians, who cannot afford a foreign education, continue to face soul-destroying competition to get into mediocre colleges. The problem is huge. Between Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the CBSE, 60 lakh new students seek college admission every year. Delhi University admits only 60,000 students a year from all over the country.

The second major failure, in my view, has been in urbanisation. By 2050, half of India’s population will be living in towns or cities that will look like shanties built on garbage mountains, unless urgent action is taken now. Most Indian cities and towns already resemble wastelands because nobody has bothered to plan them properly since 1947, and nobody appears to have understood yet that waste management needs professional expertise.

It is a fine idea to think of ‘smart’ cities but dear Prime Minister please wander around Gorakhpur by car or on foot (as I did last week) and you will realise why this cesspool of a town breeds Japanese Encephalitis that kills thousands of children every year. More than 80 per cent of the diseases that Indian children die of before they reach the age of five are caused by filthy living conditions and contaminated drinking water. Swachh Bharat is impossible without ‘swastha’ Bharat.

The third red flag I want to raise on this third anniversary is that there are no signs yet of the economic boom that people like me believed would happen as soon as Modi became Prime Minister. Candidate Modi had mocked at poverty redistribution schemes like MNREGA and said clearly that India should work for prosperity and not just hope to alleviate poverty. But, somewhere along the way he seems to have changed his mind and become a Nehruvian socialist. He appears to have decided that there is no harm in the Government of India hanging onto its public sector companies despite them being bottomless pits.

So although the Government of India could become flush with funds by selling off useless airlines and hotels, this has not happened. Nor has there been any attempt at making commercial use of the enormous tracts of urban land that the Ministries of Defence and Railways sit on. We have so far seen no signs either of the government cutting spending on itself by reducing the size of its offices and reducing the privileges of its officers. The result is that an atmosphere of stale socialism continues to permeate huge sections of the economy. And with the hunt for black money having been speeded up, some of the most corrupt officials in India now have more power than ever before.

This is not the kind of atmosphere in which an economic boom becomes possible. So alas, there is no sign yet of those joyous times that we witnessed in the wake of the end of the licence raj when it really did seem for a while as if India would finally make it to being at least a middle-income country. Having just returned from eastern Uttar Pradesh I feel it my duty as a patriotic Indian to report that it looks as bad as it always has. The only sign of modernity is that cellphones have reached everywhere as has television, and they seem incompatible with the squalor all around.

**Govt gears up to counter charge it didn’t create jobs** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government has asked all ministries and departments to prepare details of both direct and indirect employment generated from central schemes during the past three years to blunt criticism that it's term so far has failed to create enough jobs Sources said this is going to be one of the government's major counters to the offensive launched by the opposition. The ministries have been asked to come out with the data by Monday. The decision was taken at a meeting earlier this week in a meeting chaired by information and broadcasting secretary.TOI has learnt that all information officers have been asked to complete the task quickly, though it's a tough one considering that the exercise to map both direct and indirect jobs is being undertaken for the first time. ""The task is also to estimate the potential number of jobs that can be created because of the ongoing schemes and programmes,"" said an official.The official said all the data will be collated and will be taken to people through proper communication strategies.The recent report of government's labour bureau showed job generation has been anaemic at only 1.1% last year. An earlier report had pegged joblessness at a five-year high of 5% in 2015. The BJP had promised to generate two crore jobs annually in its poll manifesto. Considering that unemployment is a critical aspect which the government needs to address, the Modi government has made it a norm that every Cabinet proposal must specify how many jobs a project is likely to generate.Government sources said that four focus areas have been identified for preparing communication strategies during the third anniversary celebration of the Modi administration. Besides employment generation, the others are initiatives taken in the agriculture sector, countering left-wing extremism and terrorism.

**One Life, One Change: A vegetable market in Solan gets a new face with a few clicks** 

 ______ 
Sorting produce at the market in Solan. Officials say the e-project worked because they managed to get the commission agents onboard. Ashwani Sharma Sorting produce at the market in Solan. Officials say the e-project worked because they managed to get the commission agents onboard. Ashwani Sharma

UNTIL A year ago, Santosh Thakur would take his sacks and crates of peas, tomatoes, capsicum, beans, cauliflower and ginger to the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Solan Mandi, 46 km south of Shimla, and watch as commission agents, or arthiyas, called for bids and sealed them on his behalf.

The ex-serviceman says he was never happy with the price he got, and that he knew the agents made underhand deals with buyers but could do little about it. “That’s how these mandis have always operated. The agents charge a commission of 4 per cent from us and another 7 per cent from buyers,” says Thakur, 53, sitting in his vegetable shop 12 km from his home in Chausha village on the Shimla-Parwanoo stretch of NH 22.

That changed, however, when the markets of Solan and Shimla became part of the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) project, a flagship pan-India electronic trading portal for agricultural produce launched by the central government in April 2016. Today, Thakur can log in to the e-NAM website, access real-time wholesale rates across the country and choose his buyer, completely bypassing the agents.

Within a year of the e-NAM launch, APMC Solan has transacted business worth Rs 4.09 crore, of which Rs 3.12 crore were from apples. APMC Solan has already enrolled 4,267 farmers, 92 commission agents and 423 traders under the e-trading project.

Every morning, farmers or their representatives turn up at the entry point of the mandi with their produce, after which APMC officials examine samples for quality and grade, and weigh them in the presence of farmers. The farmers, who are registered on the e-NAM portal, then log into the website using their unique ID numbers and list the items they want to sell, with descriptions about quality and quantity.

The action moves to the “bidding hall”, on the first floor of the market yard, where APMC officials sit with their laptops around a table, facing farmers and commission agents, who now act on behalf of buyers. With a supervisor overseeing the bidding, farmers watch the giant screen on the wall, which displays the item being bid by local traders and those from other states.

After the process is done, the farmer picks a suitable bid, the transaction is frozen and the grower issued a printed e-sale agreement. It’s up to the agents to ensure that the produce reaches buyers — the APMC charges a transaction fee of one per cent from buyers.

“It’s easy. This way, we get to sell our produce at the click of a button,” says Thakur, adding that the earnings of farmers have gone up by 60 to 70 per cent since the new system came in. “From the Rs 3.5-4 lakh that I used to earn earlier, I now make around Rs 7 lakh. This system is absolutely transparent and free from hera-pheri (manipulation). Receipts of the produce sold are credited to our bank accounts by the end of the day,” he says.

APMC officials say the project worked because they managed to convince the commission agents, who were initially opposed to the change. “They felt the new system would wipe out their business. We held detailed discussions with them and offered a few additional facilities, such as retaining their commission of five percent from buyers. They were also given licences for the entire state instead of the municipal area in which they operated,” says Prakash Kashyap, secretary, APMC Solan.

Solan Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Kanwar says the administration also held training programmes and interactive sessions to bring growers, commission agents and traders on the same page.

APMC Solan has gone a step further, introducing an ‘e-retail concept’, as part of which fruits and vegetables are supplied directly to homes. Buyers can either order online through hpsubzimandi.com or call a dedicated number. Since May 2016, said officials, APMC has earned Rs 16.8 lakh through retail e-marketing. After Solan and Shimla, 17 other wholesale markets in Himachal, including those in the apple belt of Shimla, Kullu and Mandi districts, have chosen to adopt the e-NAM system.

On April 21 this year, Kanwar and Kashyap received the national award for excellence in implementation of e-NAM from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on civil services day in New Delhi.

“Solan has shown the way. It’s now up to farmers and growers to take this forward as an example for the country,” says Subash Manglet, who heads the Himachal State Agri Marketing Board, an umbrella body for the state’s mandis.

257,"tl;dw
6 months since demonetisation it is clear that the move has been politically beneficial to the BJP but the economic impact is not fully clear
In the Nov 8 announcement, PM Modi stated corruption and black money as the objectives. He expected that black money would not be able to re-enter into the system and thus be destroyed. He made a remark that ppl would rather throw their black money into the Ganga and earn punya.
While there were few cases of burning, one month in 80% of the money had already returned into the banks (according to official figures).
Official updates stopped abruptly. Media found through sources that almost all money returned into the system.
Until now there is no official figure available.
The goalposts for demonetisation have been moving.
Fin Minister stated that all deposits are under scanner and black money will be identified.
There was a series of raids all across the country (Operation clean money)
24k crores recovered after 1000's of raids. This is 1.6% of the demonetised cash.
Another 66k crores was declared.
This is approximately same as the 1L crore black money identified in 2013-14 so no gain here.
Another claim was that terrorism will be weakened. Figures of 6 months before / after demonetisation were compared
J&amp;K: Terrorist incidents 30% down, civilian deaths 170% up, sec forces deaths 45% down
Naxal: Terrorist incidents 30% down, civilian deaths 18% up, sec forces deaths 124% up
Eliminating Fake currency was another goal.
Estimated to be 400 cr i.e. 0.02% of cash. This also does not seem to have been solved. Fake new notes are appearing.
Digital payments is another objective: NEFT payments 13% up, Mobile transactions 200% down based on RBI figures (not sure what this means). Credit / debit card use is rising.
Another objective was to widen the tax base. IT dept stated that 91 lakh new tax payers added in FY 16 - 17. However this figure does not look so impressive when we compare it with the FY 14-15 figure of 76 lakh new tax payers added.",2017-05-21 10:01:44

Though many Muslims in India occupy various important positions in the state and the society – which mostly depends on where they come from and what are their class, caste, and gender – a growing sense of marginalisation among Muslims across India is hard to deny.   
  
  
This sense of marginalisation has been steadily increasing since the rise to prominence of Hindu right-wing ideologies and organisations during the 1980s, when the Babri Masjid/Ram Janmabhoomi issue was used to sharpen religious divides across India. While the occurrence of communal violence has declined since the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, the alienation felt by religious minorities – including Muslims and Christians – has continued to increase, particularly after the victory of Narendra Modi as prime minister in the 2014 election.
  

The marginalisation of Muslims in India is, indeed, well documented. In the mid-2000s, the Indian government commissioned two studies — the Sachar Committee Report of 2006 and the Misra Commission Report of 2007. These highlighted a higher prevalence of discrimination towards Muslims and socio-economic deprivation among them as compared to other religious groups. Little concrete action, however, has been taken to address these issues at the policy level. If anything, the situation has only worsened.
  

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its partner organisations in the Hindu right have started a concerted campaign against all religious minorities, including Muslims. The main features of this campaign include protests against the so-called ‘love jihad’ – Muslim men allegedly converting Hindu women to Islam by trapping them in love affairs – and ‘ghar wapsi’ (homecoming) initiatives which convert Muslims and Christians ‘back’ to Hinduism. Moves towards Hinduisation have also been taking place across India.",2017-05-21 13:26:01

Husband maintains a separate account for their parents and makes secret deposits every month; and he also maintains a box into which he deposits cash and coins and he gives the keys to parents.

Modi announces demonetization. And all of a sudden there is a cash crunch. Wife notices that husband is bringing cash when he goes into parent's room. She confronts him. There is a drama. Of course there were other things that werent' going right in their life; wife demands divorce.

There are divorce negotiations. Her lawyer is laying down the conditions. He is faced with questions which he didnt' even understand them.

1. Custody - Should I deprive my children the presence of their mother? When they aren't old enough to even go to school? Suppose I have them with me at home, I will need to take leave or cut short my professional responsibilities and stay with them.

Am I out of my mind that I will take away the home and two lovely rooms that I painted and decorated with my hands from my children? NO!

**Rajinikanth could meet PM Modi soon, tells fans to prepare for war** 

 ______ 
CHENNAI Q: Will Rajinikanth join politics? A: Politics may join Rajinikanth.This could have been one of the many jokes that the actor's name and reputation of a strongman have spawned in the last few years. But perhaps it isn't. Tamil Nadu is abuzz with speculation that the veteran actor has decided to throw his hat into the political ring. Unconfirmed reports said he would soon meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi If he does join politics, as he hinted recently, Tamil Nadu politics may see a new alignment.Frenzied fans who had gathered here at a meeting with their hero last week erupted in joy when Rajini asked them to prepare for ""war"", taking it as a signal that he would join politics.Known for its galaxy of actor-turned-politicians, Tamil Nadu seems to be getting ready to welcome more star power. And Rajinikanth's hold over cinema and fans is legion, with his July 2016 film Kabali earning around Rs 650 crore.His remarks are also well-timed, coming in the midst of a political vacuum created by the death of J Jayalalithaa and the absence in the public domain of the ailing nonagenarian DMK supremo M Karunanidhi.Rajini's fans believe their 'Thalaivar' or leader can fill that void.Known for his crisp punchlines and inimitable dialogue delivery style, Rajinikanth delivered at the meet what could virtually be a box office hit in real life, with a spate of statements on politics.He also asserting his Tamil identity, the bedrock of Dravidian politics.With his loaded statement on Monday that he had no political ambitions but would nevertheless show the door to all ""money-minded people"" if he did make the plunge, the actor seems to have touched a chord with the common man on corruption.The system was ""rotten"", he said, despite the presence of ""efficient"" leaders such as the DMK's M K Stalin and the PMK's Anbumani Ramadoss.However, not all political leaders are as excited about Rajini's possible political move as his fans.""Tamil Nadu does not need an actor but an educated person,"" former Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss of the PMK said.Rajini at the session with fans had also asked them to prepare the ground for a war, saying they would have to assemble when the battle was fought.In the olden days, he said, kings seldom maintained standing armies but the men turned up when duty called, he said.""When war comes they will come to the rescue of their motherland. I have a profession, work, duty and so do you. Go to your places, do your duty, take care of your vocation. Let us face the war when it comes,"" he roared, sending his fans into a frenzy.And when the actor, who enjoys a demi-God status among his fans, brought up the sensitive topic of his linguistic identity, he more or less sounded the war bugle.A man of Marathi roots originally from Karnataka, Rajinikanth proclaimed himself as a true-blue Tamilian.""Even though I am from Karnataka, still you have accepted me and you have made me into a Tamilian. I am a pure Tamil now.""""Naan pachai Tamizhan (I am a pure Tamil)... if you ask me to get out and throw me away, I will land only in the Himalayas and not in any other state,"" he said.It was often asked if Rajinikanth was Tamil, he said, and then provided his fans -- and the state -- with the answer.""I am 67 years old. For 23 years I was in Karnataka and 44 in Tamil Nadu. I grew up with you. I may have come here as a Kannadiga or Marathi from Karnataka but you gave me love, support, name, fame and prosperity and you have made me a Tamil,"" he said amidst loud cheers.The actor's roots often come to the fore in political discussions when rivalry between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu peaks, such as during the dispute over the Cauvery River, which often divides the people of the two states.There has often been speculation about the actor taking up a political career -- ever since he made a political debut of sorts when he asked the people not to vote for Jayalalithaa in 1996.""Even God can't save Tamil Nadu"" if AIADMK was elected again, he said.Jayalalithaa lost the assembly elections, and the DMK-TMC registering a landslide victory.In the ensuing political developments, he backed the DMK-TMC (Tamil Maanila Congress, led by the late G K Moopanar) combine, which also cashed in on the severe anti-incumbency sentiments against the ruling AIADMK.The combine could not keep the momentum on as the AIADMK staged a comeback in the 1998 Parliamentary polls.In the meantime, the actor continued to drop hints about a political entry. His film 'Baba' (2002), for instance, dealt with the protagonist's transformation from a carefree atheist to a believer, as he came in touch with a wily politician.In the film, Rajini batted for a clean politician and, soon after the man was killed, he was shown approaching the people, hinting he would lead them.Yet, whenever his fans asked him to be more active in politics, he either remained silent or distanced himself from the topic.Tamil cinema has always had close links with politics, with matinee idols such as the late M G Ramachandran (MGR) and Jayalalithaa, besides script writer M Karunanidhi, having gone on to rule the state.Ramachandran, in particular, converted his huge popularity into a springboard for his political launch, which was as successful as his cinema career.Rajini fans are eagerly waiting to see if their 'Thalaivar' will do an encore like MGR. Or like the cigarette that he flicks in the air in a trademark style, the frenzied talk will just end up in smoke.

**Sex racket busted in MP, NaMo Brigade head among 4 held** 

 ______ 
At a time when BJP is attacking AAP over sacked Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar’s MMS scandal, an alleged sex racket was busted in Madhya Pradesh with the arrest of four people, including a man who reportedly operated ‘Narendra Modi Army Brigade’.

Police booked the four people for human trafficking and also under provisions of Immoral Traffic. (Prevention) Act. A local court sent the four to 14-day judicial custody.

On Sunday, police raided a beauty saloon at Sachin Tendulkar Marg in Gwalior district, 330 km from Bhopal, on Sunday and busted the alleged sex racket being run by Rajesh Agrawal. The four, including a woman manager, a receptionist and a customer identified as Vikas alias Tinu Jain, were arrested from the spot. Jain is said to operate ‘Narendra Modi Army Brigade’.

Jain who was allegedly caught in a compromising state with a woman tried to intimidate the police by claiming to be a member of the BJP’s youth wing Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM).

Police found Jain flaunted his picture with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on his Facebook account. Jain is also seen with Railways minister Suresh Prabhu and Gwalior MP and union minister Narendra Singh Tomar on his Facebook profile.

The BJP was quick to refute about Jain having any link with the BJP or any of its allied outfits. “He is not at all related to our party,” Gwalior district BJP president Devesh Sharma said. “Anyone can get his pictures snapped with political biggies.”

City SP Maharajpura, Vinayak Verma said primary investigations revealed that Jain, a wealthy private contractor, was a customer at the saloon. “Several incriminating things were seized from the spot. We probed his alleged links with the BJP, but the probe is yet to establish it,” Verma said.

Interestingly, Jain in last status update the FB page on Sunday posted: “Mai jaisa bhi hoon samne khada hoon, mujhe kuch chupabe ki aadat nahi.” (I am present despite whatever I am, I am not in a habit of hiding anything).

Investigation revealed that the racket sourced poor girls from Nagaland on the pretext of giving them job of beauticians, but were forced into massage and sex trade. “At least five women aged between 20-22 years (all hailing from Nagaland) were brought to Gwalior. One of the women was sent to Nagaland, while the other four will soon return to their state,” Verma added.

**Narendra Modi govt preparing for surgical strike 2.0? Jitendra Singh just dropped a hint** 

 ______ 
Highlights Jitendra Singh said that the govt would do something very concrete with regard to terrorism.

Hurriyat is not an 'important' stakeholder in resolving Kashmir issue, he said.

Kashmiri youth wants to ""progress with the mainstream India"", he said.

Speaking at India Today Editors' Roundtable conference, Union Minister Jitendra Singh today said that the government would do something very concrete and decisive with regard to terrorism and cross-border aggression by Pakistan.

In response to a question if the government is planning to something to check terrorism in Kashmir and rein in Pakistan at the border and LoC, Jitendra Singh, ""Did we tell (media) before we carried out the surgical strike? We talked about this only after the operation had been done. We will not tell you what we are going to do.""

Responding to the follow up question is something being planned, Jitendra Singh said, ""We will definitely do something decisive. But, I can't tell you what that would be. The security agencies will do whatever is required.""

""You will see the results yourself,"" Jitendra Singh said.

KASHMIR UNREST IS A PROBLEM OF 350

Jitendra Singh said asserted that the youth of Kashmir 'wants to be part of the development agenda of the Narendra Modi government.'

There are certain elements in the Kashmir Valley who are stoking trouble and they are not more than 350 in number, Jitendra Singh said. ""This chapter of disturbance in Kashmir will come to an end very soon,"" Singh said while declining to give a time-frame in which the government would execute its plan. Refusing to divulge the details about how the government is preparing to deal with terrorists and their supporters, Jitendra Singh said that ""this will be a decisive policy,"" full of ""courage, conviction and consistency"" aimed to resolving the problems.

ON TALKS WITH HURRIYAT

Jitendra Singh refused to buy the argument that Hurriyat is an 'important' stakeholder in resolving Kashmir issue.

""Our agenda of alliance in Jammu and Kashmir says that we will talk to stakeholders. But who are the stakeholders. Are Kashmiri Pandits not a stakeholder? Are Sikhs and Ladakhis not stakeholders? Are 65 per cent youths of Kashmir Valley not stakeholders,"" asked Jitendra Singh.

On a specific question on Hurriyat, Jitendra Singh said, ""Hurriyat too (is a stakeholder). But, why only Hurriyat?"" The Modi government has maintained that till Hurriyat talks of separatism and 'supports' terror, it will not talk to their leaders.

Jitendra Singh invoked former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in defending government's decision not to talk to Hurriyat. He said, ""You can't shake hands with someone who has clenched fist. This is not me who says this. Indira Gandhi had said this.""

ENGAGEMENT WITH KASHMIRIS

The Union Minister in the PMO claimed that the youths of Kashmir Valley wants to ""progress with the mainstream India"". ""Just three days back, 68,000 boys and girls came out for 700 vacancies in the Jammu and Kashmir Police. This is a reflection of their choice. This shows that they want to progress and engagement with them is on,"" Singh said.

Youth forms 65 per cent of the population of Kashmir Valley and they are 'more engaged with us emotionally' now than earlier, said Jitendra Singh, who comes from Jammu and Kashmir.

332,"#***SaveAClick***

Indian cities are not particularly known for their cleanliness and it is not the first time that someone has posted a picture of the filth on social media. Yet when Tavleen Singh posted a picture of garbage on her Twitter timeline, all hell broke loose.        

The picture didn’t present any unusual sight but in the eyes of Twitter trolls, Tavleen Singh had committed nothing short of sacrilege. This was not an ordinary picture of random roadside garbage. The picture was from BJP ruled Uttar Pradesh. And, of all the cities in UP, it was from Gorakhpur, the hometown of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. And, of all the places in Gorakhpur, it was taken outside Adityanath’s magnificent Gaushala. Yes, the same cow shelter which journalists visit to write flattering pieces on how the CM fed the cows and how a certain calf came running on seeing him.      

&gt; Outside @myogiadityanath magnificent gaushala a sad sight. #SwachhBharatMission#gaurakshakpic.twitter.com/QXfqs8rdMe   

  &gt; — Tavleen Singh (@tavleen_singh) May 18, 2017

As if this was not enough, Tavleen had also tweeted the previous day.      

&gt; In Gorakhpur today and what a wretched, filthy little town it is. Yogi's influence seems limited to his temple and its environs.

  &gt; — Tavleen Singh (@tavleen_singh) May 17, 2017

That was enough provocation for trolls to descend on her timeline. At the time of writing this article, there were close to 400 replies to her posts. So varied were responses that this is a perfect case study to identify the types of responses that Modi and Yogi supporters come up to any perceived insult. Some of these are pure hilarious. Enjoy…      


#DISBELIEF AND DENIAL   

There was utter disbelief among certain quarters. Even though garbage on the sidewalks is a common sight in India, how could this be true of Gorakhpur?      
 

“Please prove it. This pic could have been taken anywhere”    

“Madam don’t put fake photos.. Have u visited the site..?”     

“Please provide the real picture with background of Gaushala not Photoshoped”    


#ULTERIOR MOTIVE     

The conspiracy theorists were convinced about a dark ulterior motive behind posting the picture. Ah! she must be out to get Yogi. Sigh!     

What else can you expect from “presstitutes”.     

“Day 2 – Operation Defame Yogi”     

“She has nothing to do with cleanliness. It is all abt defame yogi now as defame modi didnt work. She is not alone. Now dhume will RT”     


#‘60 YEARS OF CONGRESS’

How can any trolling be complete without a mention of 60 years of Congress? Never mind that Adityanath is five times elected MP from Gorakhpur. It was what about Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati and Akhilesh…. Where were you, huh? Blind, deaf, mute to everything?     


“Surprised you were blind deaf and mute when Mulayam and his goons destroyed the state , so did Mayawati . How sold are u?”      

“Why was no such comments made during SP or BSP rule”.    

“Yeah sure… filthiness just started last couple of years .. Where was ur demand for the last 70 years?”     


#WHATABOUT, WHATABOUTERY?

Yes, yes, it’s coming. Whataboutery can never be far behind in any argument. it was all the way a predictable reaction.    


“Which town in UP is not a filthy, wretched town? And why just the towns please go to large cities too.”     

“Madam amethi ja k dekho, gorakhpur paris sa dikhega apko”     


#SARCASM

Some attempted sarcasm. After all criticism of Adityanath had to be countered by any means.      

“Agree he must go and clean every toilet in gorakhpur. He is a bad CM…”      

“U travelled all the way to Gorakhpur for this snapshot? Cld hve got it near redfort in ur Delhi”     


#INSANE  

Try countering this logic, “presstitutes”     

“Then how come he was never defeated in Gorakhpur??”    


#PERSONAL ATTACK

Those who were without any argument and perhaps had a limited vocabulary launched a personal attack. In their minds, they thought, so what if the city is filthy, journalists are filthier,     

“Why don’t you start by cleaning the filth in your brain or atleast share some ideas if your senile mind still works!”     

“Saale dallo !! Presstitutes yu hi nahi kahte tumko.”    
       
“And some filthiest journalists too….”    


#GOTCHA!
       
This one was a pure gem. One person even found a found a deep dark secret way back from 2007. He had a newspaper link to prove it too. How can someone who got into a spat about not picking up litter 10 years ago dare to talk about garbage now? There was a race to prove why she was not entitled to speak on the topic.    
       
“Says #TavleenSingh doesn’t clean up after her dogs defecate on #Mumbai’s streets and who refuses to pay fines” An article from 2007 was attached to prove the point. Hats off!    
       
“Arm Chair commentators of public causes well distanced &amp; insulated from the operational exigencies. Care for a week in a Municipality?”      
      
This was becoming an unending saga of Modi and Yogi fan clubs against Tavleen Singh till finally, Sadanand Dhume provided a welcome distraction for the trolls with his tweet “Sharing this just so that I can learn about all the ways in which this absolutely, definitely, certainly doesn’t reflect on Yogi Adityanath.”        
        
Shekhar Gupta too put in his viewssaying, “Gorakhpur is the filthiest, epidemic-hit open sewer of a city. You want to see what ails the heartland, come here. @tavleen_singh pic is apt”. . He later gave space in his column to the city he called the “the capital,of the eastern and most hopeless zone of UP”. Tavleen Singh tried responding to some of the trolls individually followed by a tweet to explain that a demand for urban waste management doesn’t conflict with nationalism. It is nationalism.     
        
&gt; To all trolls: India has the filthiest cities in the world. It is nationalism to demand urban waste management urgently.

  &gt; — Tavleen Singh (@tavleen_singh) May 18, 2017
       
Understandably, after a spate of photo-shopped pictures on WhatsApp, a real picture may have appeared shocking enough to elicit these hilarious reactions. At the same time, it does leave one wondering what the reactions would have been if this was a picture from Bengal or a picture showcasing some development in Gorakhpur.       
        
Laughs aside, this brings us to the important question as to why do Modi supporters get so rattled at the slightest hint of criticism? However hilarious their responses may seem, by pouncing on critics, the army of trolls is contributing to a shrinking public space for dissent. Shouldn’t those who voted a party to power also take the lead in holding it to account. They are busy instead in silencing the critics.

334,"I would like to add some minor points which directly impact the low wage earners who have now favourable view of Modi.

My friend's dad is an exec engineer, they use to get ITI pass-outs. Earlier these people were paid 5000rs per month, Modi forced a higher wage of around say 10,000. While still a low-wage, it helps those living in small towns.

Also DBT and subsidised LPG and rural electrification are kind of things which creates favourable opinion. BJP has always been more of an urban-centric party. With Modi and Amit Shah, there has been a cultural shift to focusing on rural areas. I might disagree with their policies but their shift has been nothing short of genius. If they keep on focusing on rural areas like they are doing now, I think BJP will always be a strong political force in coming years. 

This shift is also seen with Fadnavis in Maharashtra. The way BJP has done the impossible to slowly but strongly capture Congress-NCP fortress of Marathwada, Latur, Vidarbha is just amazing. It's a good subject to study for those who like politics. ",2017-05-21 22:15:10
335,"Bunch of got killed by one of the great rulers of apparently. But since he did not like it , he got to be called great. We invented Rasgulla but our neighbours take credit for it. We invented concept of ""congress-mukt"" , Narendra Modi takes credit for it.",2017-05-21 22:22:06
336,"Modi is popular because of the ignorance of the Indian electorate. Blame it on any government but a large part of new middle class Indians have very limited knowledge and almost negligible critical thinking skills. Add to that the pathetic condition of vernacular media, and most lower middle class voters have no knowledge of India's economic position, trajectory or developmental policies. 

Most Modi voters, even if they can read it, do not understand English well enough to critically assess issues covered in the national media. It is too complex for them. So, they resort to the second best - short, to the point, grammatically 'simple' social media forwards. Generally speaking, this section of society has only rudimentary digital literacy, so fact checking is something they are not capable of doing. 

The popularity of right wing, narrow minded and bigoted populism is a failure of our education system. Of elites and intellectuals who've walled themselves off away from the 'masses', and refused to play the role of public leaders who can translate complex issues into popular language, unlike the leaders of our independent struggle and the early decades of the Republic. 

Some people will say BJP's propaganda has a role to play in this, that is a cause not an effect. Yes, the propaganda has ridden the wave, but the wave is of ignorance. 

In this, the opposition is responsible too. Rather than realising that people vote for Modi because he seems to offer simple solutions, and counter this by offering their own, they have only chosen to attack him personally. This might work as a second line of attack, but the first must be a coherent programme of development, which can be explained and communicated to the people, as they are. ",2017-05-21 22:42:21

342,"&gt; No one used to give a fuck about BJP and RSS until Modi became the prime ministerial candidate and brought a landslide victory.

They did. I don't know where you've been living, OP, but BJP and RSS have been major right-wing parties for decades now. Like there are people who do give a fuck about extreme right parties in West, but the rest of the country kept ignoring them, or didn't know about their existence (us millennials are more entrenched in our echo chambers than the generation before us). They were festering underground, waiting for their moment. In India, the Congress party has become a dynasty, lost touch with people. The latter happened with DNC in US, Whigs in UK, and slowly happening with Merkel in Germany. Watch AfD, an extremist right (almost Nazi-leaning) group reach the national assembly this year in Germany. They already have seats in state assemblies. The French think they ""saved"" their country, because the centre-left guy won 20+ million votes, and the extremist-right, xenophobic woman won *10+ million votes*, in a country of just over 66 million people. That means nearly 15% of the population (and 35% of the voting population) openly supports a bigoted, outright racist politician. And they call it ""a victory for secularism"". The level of delusion and cowardice on the left, globally, is pathetic at this point. The next big wave of right wing/protectionist philosophy is sweeping the globe, and the extremist groups are riding along in its wake.

From what I witnessed with rise of Modi, RSS and BJP big whips were not all too happy with it. Not because they necessarily cared about his views. But simply because he was clearly becoming a force to reckon with, and all these curmudgeons were losing clout to him. He carefully tailored his narrative on administration, not targeting communal messages. People bought it. Just 2 more years, and we'll see how much his words match his actions.

He cannot control RSS or extreme right groups, even if he tried. He doesn't, or doesn't seem to care, at least. But he has no control over them. Extremist ideology is not something you can control, no matter how powerful a person you might be. It perpetuates itself through the victim narrative, and then turns around and harasses people as well. They live in such a bubble of paradox, that it's astonishing and appalling at the same time.

He has to work his vote bank politics, just like Congress plays its own vote bank politics with Indian Muslims and lower castes through populist policies that turned out to be terribly corrupt and ineffective. Some of them [Muslim politicians] were fed up of it, and [switched to Modi](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-election-muslims-idUSBREA4F0ET20140516) (Not a Communal Vote section). [They are still hopeful](http://www.abplive.in/india-news/uttar-pardesh-polls-pm-modi-receives-muslim-support-in-varanasi-500524) and [voting for him](http://indianexpress.com/elections/uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2017/up-elections-results-bjp-shinning-in-muslim-stronghold-a-big-jolt-to-maya-akhilesh-samajwadi-party-bsp-bhartiya-janata-party-uttar-pradesh/).

On the other hand, Modi has also tacitly given approval to the extremist right-wing elements, from time to time. He invited Raj Thackray for his inauguration (although that might be seen as a move to mitigate his [Thackray's] extremist, anti-North Indian stance; I don't know if it worked), keeps peddling the ""Indian mythology = genuine history"" rhetoric, ignores or is quite over the far right influence in BJP, and is now dragging in anti-intellectuals in his policy making (re: Arthakranti).

To give a greater perspective, these harassers were there during Congress rule as well. The equivalent of anti-Romeo squad, for one, existed and harassed couples during Valentines then as they do now. Now with BJP currently politically favoured (who else is there, btw, besides Congress and BJP? The fabled Third Front?), the extremist right groups take that as a legitimisation of their extremist views. This keeps on happening, incessantly.

Maybe in two terms, Modi will be out, BJP will be in obscurity like Congress is now, and will have to bide it's time as Congress rises to power. Then starts the circus of sycophancy with Congress. We'll soften on foreign stance, as happens under Congress rule, make heavy compromises with west (as happened under PM Singh). Some populist policies here and there, to get that second term. And by end of that, the policies turn out to be sham and rotting inside out with corruption.

But the ground reality remains the same. Anti-Romeo squads will still exist under various pretenses; some fanatic will be zealously worshiping cows, and getting into skirmishes with abattoir owners; misogyny and racism will still be the incurable cancer of society. People here will blame everything on Congress then, or at least that crowd will be more vocal, as everything is Modi's fault now.

Some here will already be triggered and start crying ""BHAKT!!"", even though I am pointing out the glaring flaws and vices of both sides. It's politics. It's ugly, emotionally charged, crowded with inflated egos and unshakable beliefs.",2017-05-22 00:06:31
343,"Tavleen Singh was anti Congress before it was fashionable. She was one of the earliest to take a pro Modi stance, even when he was still anathema to the mainstream media.

Glad to see she is still calling it as she sees it.",2017-05-22 00:22:46
344,"Modi doesn't control RSS. Infact, I would say it's the other way around. 

The thing about politicians is, we can always tell what their true beliefs are by examining their origins. How did they began their career. 

Modi was not a hardcore RSS member. He shares similar ideologies with RSS, but he is slightly moderate if you compare with RSS which one could call a far right organisation. 

BJP originated as Janta party and evolved from a hardliner hindu nationalist agendas (ram temple) towards a expanded agendas like neoliberal economic policies. 

One might think that RSS and BJP's core hindu nationalism beliefs are exactly the same, but that isn't so. BJP is more liberal at least in case of economic policies, but RSS is purely protectionist, swadeshi and hindu chauvinistic​ group while BJP tries to balance hindu nationalism, neoliberal economic policies and welfare... As long as... They don't conflict with RSS's core beliefs. 

There are some instances where RSS and BJP do not meet eye to eye on some issues. This is more pronounced in MH because RSS has an 'alternative' conduit (Shiv sena) to lobby their beliefs. 

Modi absolutely cannot upset his ideological ally because BJP draws a lot of support from RSS because many BJP members lean more towards RSS. If RSS (covertly) starts supporting smaller parties who do align with their core beliefs, BJP loses out on votes. That is why Shiv Sena leadership is focussing on attracting hardliners by saying exactly what a hardliner would say, for example, Ban Pakistani actors, bomb Pakistan, Modi is too soft on Pakistan, too soft in kashmir etc. 

But I just hate it when he keeps his silence over various cow vigilante lynchings or beef killings. He just can't criticise these elements because it would weaken him within bjp, by upsetting those hardliners. 

This gives an idea to those cow vigilantes that what they are doing is okay. Prime minister isn't saying anything? Let's carry on.

BJP should realise that the reason why it got elected in 2014 was that people now truly want a scam free government which focuses on true development. Modi got elected by his famous -Gujarat model of development, not by barking about some temples or cows or some other hindu right wing agenda. (Which it did, in bihar, and therefore, lost.)

**India's ""new Silk Road"" snub highlights gulf with China**

NEW DELHI: China invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and six cabinet colleagues to its ""new Silk Road "" summit this month, even offering to rename a flagship Pakistani project running through disputed territory to persuade them to attend, a top official in Modi's ruling group and diplomats said.But New Delhi rebuffed Beijing's diplomatic push, incensed that a key project in its massive initiative to open land and sea corridors linking China with the rest of Asia and beyond runs through Pakistani controlled Kashmir.The failure of China's efforts to bring India on board, details of which have not been previously reported, shows the depths to which relations between the two countries have fallen over territorial disputes and Beijing's support of Pakistan India's snub to the ""Belt and Road"" project was the strongest move yet by Modi to stand up to China.But it risks leaving India isolated at a time when it may no longer be able to count on the United States to back it as a counterweight to China's growing influence in Asia, Chinese commentators and some Indian experts have said.Representatives of 60 countries, including the United States and Japan, travelled to Beijing for the May 14-15 summit on President Xi Jinping's signature project.But Ram Madhav, an influential leader of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) involved in shaping foreign policy, said India could not sign up so long as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - a large part of the ""Belt and Road"" enterprise - ran through parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir that India considers its own territory.""China routinely threatens countries when it finds issues even remotely connected to its own sovereignty question being violated,"" Madhav said. ""No country compromises with its sovereignty for the sake of trade and commerce interests.""India, due to the size and pace of expansion of its economy, could potentially be the biggest recipient of Chinese investment from the plan to spur trade by building infrastructure linking Asia with Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to a Credit Suisse report released before the summit.Chinese investments into India could be anything from $84 billion to $126 billion between 2017 to 2021, far higher than Russia, Indonesia and Pakistan, countries that have signed off on the initiative, it said.China has not offered any specific projects to India, but many existing schemes, such as a Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor that has been planned for years, have now been wrapped into the Belt and Road enterprise.China is also conducting feasibility studies for high-speed rail networks linking Delhi with Chennai in southern India that would eventually connect to the modern day ""Silk Road"" it is seeking to create.But if India continues to hold back from joining China's regional connectivity plans the commercial viability of those plans will be called into question, analysts say.China has held talks with Nepal to build an $8 billion railway line from Tibet to Kathmandu, but it ultimately wants the network to reach the Indian border to allow goods to reach the huge Indian market.India has other worries over China's growing presence in the region, fearing strategic encirclement by a ""string of pearls"" around the India Ocean and on land as China builds ports, railways and power stations in country such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.Ashok Kantha, who was India's ambassador to China until 2016, said India had repeatedly conveyed its concerns to China, especially about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the need to have open discussions about it.""Where is the economic rational for CPEC?"" he said. ""There is no major economic driver, the drivers are essentially political and strategic in character.""Just a week before the summit, China's ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui, offered to change the name of CPEC to placate New Delhi and ensure it didn't boycott the Beijing conference.Luo did no elaborate on the proposal, made during a speech at an Indian military think-tank, according to people who attended the meeting and local media reports. A transcript released later by the Chinese embassy did not include a reference to changing the project's name.But Chinese officials in the past have suggested this could mean adding India to the name to make it the ""China-Pakistan-India Economic Corridor"".A Chinese diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested India could build infrastructure on its side of Kashmir which could eventually be linked to the roads and power lines China planned to build in Pakistani Kashmir.Indian experts said another proposal explored in meetings between former diplomats and academics from the two sides was renaming the project the ""Indus Corridor"" to overcome India's objection that the ""China-Pakistan"" name endorses Pakistan's claim to Kashmir. Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, which they both claim in full. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not comment directly on any offer to change the name of CPEC, but drew attention to President Xi's remarks during the summit that China would follow the principle of peaceful co-existence and that New Delhi need not worry.""I think the concerns from the India side should be able to be resolved,"" she said.Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Baglay said New Delhi had not received any suggestions through proper channels and that India wanted a meaningful discussion with China on the whole project.

**Investment, trade likely to top Canada PM Justin Trudeau’s agenda on India visit** 

 ______ 
Relations between Canada and India have always been cordial. However, a controversy erupted recently after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh refused to meet Canadian defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan, calling him a ‘Khalistani sympathiser’. The Indian government also frowned upon Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s attendance at Khalsa Day Parade, where tableaus for Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale were put up. In an interview with ET’s Krishna Kumar, Canadian high commissioner to India, Nadir Patel defends reasons behind Trudeau’s attendance at Khalsa Day Parade. Excerpts:Our priorities would include increased trade and investment. We would also like to pursue deeper multilateral fora. Canada is the sixth largest exporter of defence equipment in the world, which many don’t know. The defence industry between Canada and India is very limited and we would like to see increase in trade. Canada is best equipped to support India’s clean energy needs whether it is solar or Uranium for the civil nuclear power plants.India has always been important for Canada and our PM has said India is a top priority for us. We are both democratic countries and have a lot to benefit from each other in terms of trade. India is a bright spot around the world in terms of economic growth led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who has done a number of economic reforms. Canadian investment in the last two years alone has increased by 13 to 14 billion dollars, which is quite significant. Helping India prosper and generating more jobs for Indians-there are so many synergies and hence we are interested in doing more with India.The PM’s schedule is published in advance so he can go to any event where people will show up with placard and signs and what not. We have appreciated and taken the view of the Indian government very seriously. At the same time our PM would go to events and we can’t control who shows up and what they come up with. We have made it clear (to India) that the vast majority of Sikhs in Canada are peace- loving and making significant contributions to Canadian society and Canada-Indian relationship. If any law is broken and cause concern and if their activities would go against our legislative framework then our security agencies will act on it right away. We don’t support the breakup of any country.’...The minister (Sajjan) has responded to it effectively and he does not support the breaking away of India. His (Amarinder Singh) comments were not accurate and were disappointing. Our view is that we have a lot to offer to Punjab government in terms of agriculture, education and health care. We value our relationship with Punjab. We want him (Amarinder) to succeed in his reforms agenda.That is something you would have to ask him.

**91 Lakh New Taxpayers In Full Year, Not After Notes Ban: Finance Ministry** 

 ______ 
The finance ministry clarified that 91 lakh taxpayers were added during the
financial year 2016-2017.

**New Delhi: **

Union Minister Arun Jaitley cited a jump in the number of new taxpayers while
discussing the effects of demonetisation last week. The figure quoted -- 91
lakh - was widely reported by the media as a jump since Prime Minister
Narendra Modi announced the notes ban on November 8. The finance ministry has
now clarified that the figure was for the entire financial year of 2016-2017.

The Chairman of the CBDT (the Central Board of Direct Taxes) Sushil Chandra,
was present at the media conference addressed by Mr Jaitley on the launch of
Operation Clean Money. Yesterday, Meenakshi Goswami, Income Tax Commissioner
and the official spokesperson of the CBDT, told NDTV that 91 lakh was the
total number of new taxpayers enrolled in the financial year 2016-2017. Till
April 2016, the total number of taxpayers in the country was 5 crore.

For the financial year 2014-15, finance ministry data shows an addition of 76
lakh new taxpayers. Two years down the line, the figure of 91 lakh, a 15-lakh
increase, is also indicative of a steadily growing tax base. There is no
publicly available data for financial year 2015-16.

Claiming a big success in detection of illegal money, tax officials said a
total of Rs 24,044 crore of undisclosed income was detected during searches,
surveys and seizures post-demonetisation.

But in 2013-14, searches and surveys led to the detection of Rs 1,01,181 crore
-- nearly 4 times as much. Even considering Rs 24,044 crore is the figure for
the last 6 months and not a full financial year, it is still considerably
less.

**A ‘mind-boggling’ reform looms over India’s $2 trillion economy** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is set to dramatically reshape Asia’s third-largest economy with the biggest tax reform since independence in 1947.

After finding common ground among India’s 29 states, the finance ministry on Friday released detailed rates for the incoming goods and services tax, slotting more than 1,200 items—from sugar to steel pipes and motorcycles—into five tax brackets between zero and 28%. With that done, India is almost ready to implement a tax code that unifies more than a dozen separate levies, effectively creating a single market with a population greater than the US, Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Japan combined.

“It is a tax revolution, in many ways, because the indirect tax structure in India was hopelessly chaotic,” said Raghbendra Jha, head of the economics department at Australian National University. “It’s mind boggling, the sheer magnitude of the reform taking place.”

The sweeping tax reform will gradually reshape India’s business landscape, make the world’s fastest-growing major economy an easier place to do business and is likely to raise government revenues by widening the tax net in the country’s largely informal $2 trillion economy. That means India could spend more on desperately needed infrastructure and training programs for a workforce that is growing by 1 million people each month, laying the groundwork for longer-term growth.

Also Read: GST Council’s next step: Ensuring tax benefits are passed on to consumers

With tax experts praising the rates as moderate and generally lower-than-expected, it seems possible Modi might be able to roll out this reform without a politically damaging rise in inflation. However some economists and analysts see a 1 July deadline as unrealistic, raising the possibility that less than 10 months after demonetisation, India’s economy could again be upturned as businesses struggle to comply with the new tax code.

Chaotic implementation

Business groups, fearing a chaotic implementation, have lobbied the government for a 1 September roll out. They argue that companies—particularly small-and-medium-sized enterprises that contribute more than 30% of India’s GDP—need more time as they struggle to become tax compliant in the new system.

“To expect that the rates are out on the 18th, 19th of May, and everyone will be able to plug in and run with it by 1 July is very far fetched,” said Dinesh Kanabar, the Mumbai-based chief executive officer of Dhruva Advisors LLP and former deputy CEO of KPMG India.

Also Read: A crucial piece of GST puzzle is still missing

Still, lower-than-expected rates mean that there may be little or only mild inflation, less than in other countries that have implemented a GST, he added.

There “was an expectation that the government would jack up the rates from the effective rates, which could lead to a huge amount of inflation,” Kanabar said. “What we see today is very different. The rates are moderate. And in most cases, the rates are consistent or lower.”

Political win

For Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, the release of detailed GST rates is a big political win. It’s the relatively calm culmination of months of political wrangling with state governments all trying to shape the country’s new tax code in their own favour.

“The process of agreeing the GST rates for individual items has been remarkably smooth considering that the overall GST negotiations for India has been a tortuous political process among national and state legislatures that has taken a decade,” said Rajiv Biswas, IHS Markit’s Asia-Pacific chief economist

Tax base

Importantly for India, a country in which fewer than 1% pay income tax, the GST will broaden its tax base, according to University of Melbourne economist Nathan Taylor.

“It will have profoundly positive implications for the economy,” Taylor said.

Jha, the ANU professor, said India’s enhanced tax revenues should be used to boost spending on health and education, which is significantly lower as a percentage of GDP than many other countries.

“The paucity of tax revenue has been a plague for India,” Jha said. “You have a population that is young, that is waiting to be trained and educated, and you don’t have the resources to attend to them. Any increase in tax compliance, in government revenues, can’t come to soon.” Bloomberg

**Modi government is firming up a plan to create India's own Harvard** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India has taken a firm step towards building 20 world-class educational institutions, which will be termed Institutions of Eminence, with the human resource development ministry moving the proposal to the Union Cabinet for approval. Firmly bearing the stamp of the Prime Minister’s Office, this is a new framework to catapult Indian institutions to global recognition by freeing the best of them from the University Grants Commission’s restrictive regulatory regime and ushering in an unprecedented level of institutional autonomy. Here are some of the finer details:The UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) regulations, 2017 will govern all such institutions that are conferred with this status, ensuring their complete academic, administrative and financial autonomy. These regulations will override all other UGC regulations and free the institutions of UGC’s restrictive inspection regime, the regulatory control over fee and curriculum.* The institutions will have to achieve a place in the top 500 of any of the global rankings within 10 years of being declared an institution of eminence and eventually reach the top 100 slot* They will have a teacher:student ratio of 1:20 to begin with and 1:10 in five years, with a student enrolment of 15,000 in 15 years. There will be a good mix of Indian and international faculty, and only those who come with a degree from top 500 institutions in global rankings will be considered eligible foreign faculty.* The institutions will be free to select students through a merit-based transparent admission process to ensure no meritorious student is turned away for lack of funds. Up to 30% foreign students vis-a-vis the strength of domestic students can be admitted. The institution will be free to decide its fee structure but will have to declare it in a transparent manner. Any reports of capitation fee will be treated as serious violation. An Ombudsman will be set up to cater to student grievances.* One paper will have to be published per faculty member per year on average in a reputed peer reviewed international journal, with publications included in SCOPUS, Web Science, etc to be counted as a research publication. A world-class library with subscriptions to reputed journals related to courses offered will have to be maintained along with cutting-edge research in frontier areas.* Along-term lead campus (30 years minimum) with adequate space for expansion.* While private institutions will not get any government funding they will be able to access government funds for specific studies and projects they may execute.* Full freedom to the institution to decide course structure, the credit hours needed for a degree, fixing of curriculum and syllabus and up to 20% online courses as part of its programmes and fully online certificate courses. Full freedom to hire faculty, even industry personnel as faculty and choose any career progression scheme, salary structure for its faculty. None of its academic collaborations will need government approval unless they are with countries on the foreign ministry’s or home ministry’s ‘negative list’.* Ten government run and ten private institutions will be conferred this status, with Rs 10,000 crore funding earmarked for the former.* While a government-owned institution will apply to HRD ministry for the special status, a private deemed to be university or private state universitywill have to be backed by a sponsoring organisation with a total net worth of Rs 5,000 crore and credible members, an identified first chancellor and vice chancellor, and a detailed 15-year vision plan besides a five-year rolling implementation plan.* The governance structure of the institution and its sponsoring organisation will be different.* An empowered expert committee with three to five eminent persons appointed for three years with the final approval of the appointments committee of the Cabinet headed by the PM will select the 20 institutes. The EEC will recommend the names to the UGC, which will forward its decision to the HRD ministry that will issue a letter of intent to such institutions and decide on the final conferment of the status after a memorandum of understanding.* EEC will monitor and review the institutions of eminence to ensure quality, decide on appeals, changes in transfer of sponsorship and liquidation of corpus fund if necessitated amongother things.

**On the cards, caste-based reservation benefits for Neo-Buddhists in central schemes** 

 ______ 
The Centre is mulling changes to caste certificates to allow Neo-Buddhists — members of SC communities who converted to Buddhism — to mention the reserved caste they belonged to before conversion.

The move will entitle the community to caste-based reservation benefits in central schemes, a demand they have been raising for long despite being eligible for such benefits in some states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

Maharashtra social justice minister, Rajkumar Badole said he was hopeful after meeting his counterpart at the Centre, Ramdas Athawale, a Neo-Buddhist himself, to press for early action.

“If a Neo-Buddhist is sitting for the UPSC examination, they cannot get the benefits of caste-based reservation and are listed in the general category... because the caste certificate does not register them as Scheduled Castes,” Badole told HT.

He said while the Centre had given “in-principle approval” to make the amendment to the format of caste certificates, there has been “an inordinate delay” since 2016.

Since the Narendra Modi government is trying to woo the reserved communities and appear pro-Dalit, there is a sense that this would be done soon.

Badole recalled that members of Scheduled Caste communities who converted to Buddhism — a practice that was started by Dr BR Ambedkar — were treated as minorities.

An amendment was made to the law in 1990 for providing reservation benefit to them, but they are left out when it comes to central schemes, he said, adding there are over 60 lakh people in Maharashtra who stand to gain from the changes.

The caste certificate, he said, must have a provision to either allow Neo-Buddhists to list their caste or mention the serial number of the caste they hail from.

“Maharashtra government has prepared a format. The Centre can just adopt it,” he said.

His demand was echoed by BJP MP from Delhi and Dalit leader Udit Raj.

“Converting to Buddhism does not mean undoing the benefits that are given for those who come from reserved castes. Even if people don’t mention their castes, it still exists, so they should not be deprived of benefits,” he told HT.

**‘Enough negative politics’: Shatrughan takes on critics targeting Lalu, Kejriwal** 

 ______ 
Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and RJD boss Lalu Prasad, facing corruption allegation, have received a support from an unusual ally: BJP’s Shatrughan Sinha.

“Enough of negative politics &amp; mudslinging by opponents on our political leaders, be it Kejriwal, Laloo Yadav (sic) or Sushil Modi,” Sinha tweeted on Monday.

The actor-turned-politician said the allegations must be substantiated.

“High time to substantiate your claims..or pack up! Can’t just keep feeding media with one night stories &amp; sensationalising. Enough is enough!”

Enough of negative politics &amp; mudslinging by opponents on our political leaders, be it Kejriwal, Laloo Yadav or Sushil Modi..High time..1&gt;2 — Shatrughan Sinha (@ShatruganSinha) May 22, 2017

A Lok Sabha member from Bihar, Sinha said he holds all political leaders, especially Kejriwal, in high esteem for their “credibility, struggle &amp; commitment” towards society.

“Our BJP surely believes in honesty &amp; transparency, which seldom go together, but must go together. An allegation is ONLY THAT unless proved!” he wrote on the micro blogging site.

Kejriwal’s former colleague Kapil Mishra has accused him of giving undue benefits to a relative and taking Rs 2 crore in cash from another minister, Satyendra Jain.

Lalu Prasad’s family members have been accused of amassing wealth disproportionate to their known income.

In both cases, the Bharatiya Janata Party is one of the most prominent voices calling for action against the two leaders.

Sinha’s tweet triggered an outrage in the BJP. “Jis Lalu ki benami sampatti ke bachav mein Nitish nahi utare, uske bachav mein bhajpa ke shatru kood pade (BJP’s ‘shatru’ came to the defence of the benami properties of that Lalu who is not being defended by even Nitish),” Bihar BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi wrote on Twitter.

Sinha is known for airing views contrary to the party’s stand and has been sidelined by the BJP. He has praised Kejriwal and Lalu in the past as well.

**'Mind Boggling' Reform That Will Reshape India's $2 Trillion Economy** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is set to dramatically reshape
Asia's third-largest economy with the biggest tax reform since independence in
1947.

After finding common ground among India's 29 states, the finance ministry on
Friday released detailed rates for the incoming goods and services tax,
slotting more than 1,200 items -- from sugar to steel pipes and motorcycles --
into five tax brackets between zero and 28 percent. With that done, India is
almost ready to implement a tax code that unifies more than a dozen separate
levies, effectively creating a single market with a population greater than
the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Japan combined.

""It is a tax revolution, in many ways, because the indirect tax structure in
India was hopelessly chaotic,"" said Raghbendra Jha, head of the economics
department at Australian National University. ""It's mind boggling, the sheer
magnitude of the reform taking place.""

The sweeping tax reform will gradually reshape India's business landscape,
make the world's fastest-growing major economy an easier place to do business
and is likely to raise government revenues by widening the tax net in the
country's largely informal $2 trillion economy. That means India could spend
more on desperately needed infrastructure and training programs for a
workforce that is growing by 1 million people each month, laying the
groundwork for longer-term growth.

With tax experts praising the rates as moderate and generally lower-than-
expected, it seems possible Modi might be able to roll out this reform without
a politically damaging rise in inflation. However some economists and analysts
see a July 1st deadline as unrealistic, raising the possibility that less than
10 months after demonetization, India's economy could again be upturned as
businesses struggle to comply with the new tax code.

**Chaotic Implementation**

Business groups, fearing a chaotic implementation, have lobbied the government
for a September 1 roll out. They argue that companies -- particularly small-
and-medium-sized enterprises that contribute more than 30 percent of India's
GDP -- need more time as they struggle to become tax compliant in the new
system.

""To expect that the rates are out on the 18th, 19th of May, and everyone will
be able to plug in and run with it by July 1 is very far fetched,"" said Dinesh
Kanabar, the Mumbai-based CEO of Dhruva Advisors LLP and former deputy CEO of
KPMG India.

Still, lower-than-expected rates mean that there may be little or only mild
inflation, less than in other countries that have implemented a GST, he added.

There ""was an expectation that the government would jack up the rates from the
effective rates, which could lead to a huge amount of inflation,"" Kanabar
said. ""What we see today is very different. The rates are moderate. And in
most cases, the rates are consistent or lower.""

The tax reform, however, is far from perfect as it should only have had one
rate, Jha said. Instead, there are four divergent rates and multiple
exemptions. Air conditioners, refrigerators and makeup will be taxed at 28
percent, for example, while toothpaste lands at 18 percent and fruit juice at
12 percent.

Plane tickets attract a 5 percent GST rate, but business class tickets will be
taxed at 12 percent, finance secretary Hasmukh Adia said. Staples such as food
grains, fresh vegetables and milk are not taxed at all, while Finance Minister
Arun Jaitley said education and health services will continue to be exempted.

**Political Win**

For Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, the release of detailed GST rates is
a big political win. It's the relatively calm culmination of months of
political wrangling with state governments all trying to shape the country's
new tax code in their own favor.

""The process of agreeing the GST rates for individual items has been
remarkably smooth considering that the overall GST negotiations for India has
been a tortuous political process among national and state legislatures that
has taken a decade,"" said Rajiv Biswas, IHS Markit's Asia-Pacific chief
economist.

**Tax Base**

Importantly for India, a country in which fewer than 1 percent pay income tax,
the GST will broaden its tax base, according to University of Melbourne
economist Nathan Taylor.

""It will have profoundly positive implications for the economy,"" Taylor said.

Jha, the ANU professor, said India's enhanced tax revenues should be used to
boost spending on health and education, which is significantly lower as a
percentage of GDP than many other countries.

""The paucity of tax revenue has been a plague for India,"" Jha said. ""You have
a population that is young, that is waiting to be trained and educated, and
you don't have the resources to attend to them. Any increase in tax
compliance, in government revenues, can't come to soon.""

**Japan to help India improve textile quality, raise exports** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India is looking to expand its paltry 1.24% share of the Japanese textile market by getting its government to pitch in and help Indian exporters by improving the testing standards and better understanding the requirements of their customers.Kick-starting the initiative, the Centre held a workshop in association with Japanese quality regulator QTEC . The idea, said Subrata Gupta, joint secretary in the textiles ministry, was to change the ""mindset"" and ""enhance"" the quantum of textiles exports to Japan. Japan is a major textile importing country with almost 97% of their textile requirement being sourced through imports mainly from China (62.11%), Vietnam (10.56%), Indonesia (4.12%) and Bangladesh (2.76%).India accounts for just 1.24%.The association with QTEC is important in view of the fact that India's exports have been going down compared to countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. For instance, it could only notch up $40 billion in revenues from textile exports as against a target of $47.5 billion set in 2015-16.The association with QTEC is expected to not only expose Indian exporters to quality expectations from Japanese buyers but also help the textile ministry give a push to overall exports. ""This is the first of many other measures we plan to increase exports to Japan, which is one of the major textile importing countries. It's a market which has tremendous potential for India,"" said Ajit B Chavan, secretary, textiles committee.Asked whether the Chinese presence was likely to be an obstacle, Chavan said that once the Indian exporters understood the requirements of the Japanese market, ""wresting"" a part of the market from competitors would not be difficult.The MoU with Japanese Textile Products Quality and Technology Centre (QTEC) was signed in November last year, during the visit of PMNarendra Modi to Japan. Equipped with CCTV cameras, smoke and fire detection system, the 19-coach Tejas train will have biovacuum toilets and GPSbased passenger information display system. Unlike the Shatabdi Express, passengers will have the option to opt for onboard food. There will be comfortable seating arrangements and each seat will have LED TV with touch control system and call bell facilities.""There will be tea and coffee vending machines and snack tables at each coach as catering facility for passengers in the new designed coaches,"" said an official, adding that there will be magazines, snacks tables, LCD screens, and wi-fi.In a first in non-suburban train service in railways, the coaches manufactured at the Rail Coach Factory in Kapurthala, will have automatic entrance door. Tejas Express will also be pressed into service in Delhi-Chandigarh and Delhi-Lucknow sectors.

**Travelling by Tejas Express to cost you 20 per cent more than a journey by Shatabdi** 

 ______ 
Travelling by Tejas Express train will cost you 20 per cent more than by the Shatabdi Express.

Equipped with modern facilities such as CCTV cameras and smoke-and-fire detection system, Tejas Express will be flagged off from Mumbai for Goa on May 22 by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu.

Unlike the Shatabdi Express, passengers will have the option to opt for meals on-board. If a passenger opts for food while buying the ticket, the catering charge will be included in the fare.

HERE IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IN 10 POINTS There is an increase of more than 20 per cent in the base fare for Tejas as against the Shatabdi, said a railway ministry official. The superfast surcharge, reservation fee and catering charges will be levied separately. The Executive Class fare in Tejas has been fixed at Rs 2,540 without food and Rs 2,940 with food. The Chair Car fare is Rs 1,850 with food and Rs 1,220 without food. The Shatabdi fares are Rs 2,390 and Rs 1,185 in EC and CC respectively, which include food also. Since the train is equipped with better facilities, the fare will also be slightly higher as compared to normal mail/express service, Prabhu had said while inspecting the new Tejas coaches on Friday. Equipped with CCTV cameras apart from smoke-and-fire detection system, the 19-coach Tejas train will have bio-vacuum toilets and GPS-based passenger information display system. There will be comfortable seating arrangements and each seat will have LED TV with touch-control system and call bell facilities. Manufactured at the Rail Coach Factory in Kapurthala, the coaches will have automatic entrance door, a first in non-suburban train in the Indian Railways. Promised in the budget, Tejas Express will also be pressed into service in Delhi-Chandigarh and Delhi-Lucknow sectors soon.

**Defence gets its aim right, but still far from hitting reforms target - Times of India** 

 ______ 
surgical strikes against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir +

No major 'Make in India' defence project +

NEW DELHI: Well begun, it is said, is half done. There has been a flurry of new initiatives and policy decisions on several fronts in the gigantic defence ministry , with all its national security imperatives and complexities, since the Modi government assumed office three years ago.However, while marking a decisive shift from the status quoist era under the risk-averse A K Antony's eight-year stint as defence minister, good beginnings are yet to largely translate into concrete realities on the ground. Yes, the government has fulfilled its promise to implement the long-pending one rank, one-pension scheme for over 21 lakh veterans, notwithstanding some disgruntlement over its final form.The Army also carried out, a departure from the past. The functioning of the defence ministry has been scam-free so far. But, from the crucial chief of defence staff post and tri-Service commands to handle space, cyberspace and special operations, to bold measures required to invigorate India's moribund defence-industrial base, the ""radical systemic changes"" promised by the 2014 BJP manifesto are still missing in action., for instance, has actually taken off till now. The proposed National Maritime Authority is nowhere on the horizon. Far-reaching measures like the ""strategic partnership"" policy to boost the private sector's role in defence production, finally approved by the defence ministry last week, will take at least another year to be rolled out.The planned defence procurement organisation, in turn, will take another two years to take shape. Yes, the government has cut through the stupefying red-tape and long-winded arms procurement procedures to push through deals like the ones for 36 Rafale fighters, 145 M-777 ultra-light howitzers, and 22 Apache attack and 15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters.It also creditably empowered the beleaguered armed forces to buy emergency stocks of ammunition and spares to ensure they could undertake at least 10 days of ""intense fighting"" if matters come to a head with hostile neighbours. But the armed forces still continue to battle critical deficiencies in areas ranging from submarines and fighters to multi-role helicopters and night-fighting capabilities.The direct acquisition of 36 Rafales, ordered from France for Rs 59,000 crore last September after scrapping the deadlocked MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) project for 126 fighters, for instance, will in itself not do.The IAF is making do with just 33 fighter squadrons (each with 18 jets) when at least 44 are needed to tackle the ""collusive threat"" from China and Pakistan.The Rafale deal, unlike the original 126-jet project, also has no technology transfer involved. Not having a full-time Raksha Mantri has been a glaring problem.First, Arun Jaitley held dual charge for almost six months in 2014, with the finance ministry obviously his first priority. Then, there was Manohar Parrikar for a little over two years, whose heart was set on returning to Goa as chief minister. Now, we are back to square one, with Jaitley again playing the dual-hatted role.Decision-making has become faster though. Since 2014-15, initial approvals have been accorded to around 140 capital procurement projects worth over Rs 4 lakh crore, with 96 of them worth over Rs 2.5 lakh crore involving domestic production.Similarly, around 150 actual contracts worth over Rs 2 lakh crore have been inked. These include around 80 capital procurement contracts worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore inked with foreign vendors. But there has hardly been any hike in the country's annual defence budget . The 2017-18 defence outlay of Rs 2.74 lakh crore works out to just 1.63% of the projected GDP, the lowest since the 1962 war with China. Clearly, much more needs to be done, and with the requisite follow-through.

**After doing ‘Mann ki Baat’, Modi to get people’s feedback through ‘Jann ki Baat’**

Having reached out to the masses with his ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio programme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will now get people’s feedback on his government’s programmes and policies through ‘Jann ki Baat’. ‘Jann ki Baat’ will form part of the 20-day celebrations the BJP has planned to mark the Modi government’s three years in office beginning May 26, the day he was sworn-in as prime minister in 2014. BJP chief ministers and ministers in states will visit those ruled by their political rivals, with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath travelling to Bihar and his Madhya Pradesh counterpart Shivraj Singh Chouhan to Karnataka and Odisha.

Over 450 BJP leaders, including Modi, members of his council of ministers, party chief Amit Shah, and other office bearers will hold 900 events in places outside their home states between May 26 and June 15, Union Minister Smriti Irani and party general secretary Arun Singh said on Monday. Modi will kick off the exercise with a number of events in Guwahati on May 26.

Shah will visit Kerala, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, Chhattisgarh and Arunachal Pradesh, while top union ministers Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Nitin Gadkari will attend events in Mumbai and Jaipur, Delhi and Lucknow, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar and Chhattisgarh, and Chennai and Ranchi respectively.

Most party chief ministers will go to non-BJP ruled states. Making of Developed India (MODI), a “festival” to celebrate the Modi government’s three years in office, will be one of the seven major events and people, especially youth, will be informed about various government schemes, and urged to download related apps on their mobiles, Irani told a press conference. Government agencies and the ruling party will organise these events.

Through ‘Jann ki Baat’ (people’s voice), common people can record their feedback on the performance of the government, she said.

Singh said 330 BJP MPs, 11 chief ministers, five deputy chief ministers, ministers in state governments, besides organisational functionaries will participate in these programmes. BJP’s NDA allies will be involved in celebrations organised by the government, he said. “They will each hold two events in states outside their home state. They also have to organise events in their home state and constituencies (for MPs),” he said. They will hold rallies, visit colonies populated by the poor and meet the local intelligentsia, he said.

Irani cited central government programmes, including the one to provide LPG connections to poor households, ‘Jan Dhan’, and ‘Mudra’ Yojana, 70 per cent of whose beneficiaries are women, to claim that the government has touched the lives of the poor across the country.

**Modi government mulls allowing 100% FDI in retail, with caveats**

The Narendra Modi govt is considering allowing 100% FDI in multi-brand retail as long as the products are made in India—in an attempt to promote Make In India with job creation at its core. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint

New Delhi: To promote its flagship Make In India scheme with job creation at its core, the Narendra Modi government is considering allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail—as long as the products are made in India.

A government official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the proposal is being considered. “A final decision on the matter will be taken after wider consultation,” he added.

The policy is unlikely to be termed “FDI in multi-brand retail” as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is opposed to the idea and had promised in its 2014 election manifesto to not allow this.

In 2012, the then Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government allowed 51% FDI in multi-brand retail (supermarkets and the like) in some cities, subject to the approval of state governments. When it came to power in 2014, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government put the policy on ice without a formal notification.

The current proposal by the government, if implemented, is expected to be vastly different from the UPA policy as it will not allow imported items to be sold by multinational supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. However, it is likely to do away with city-specific and sourcing restrictions put by the UPA government. The UPA had restricted such supermarkets to cities with population in excess of 1 million and mandated that they source 30% of their products from small and medium enterprises.

An executive at a large retail chain, who asked that neither he nor his firm be identified, said the policy being considered would make sense for foreign supermarket chains, though local supermarkets would still have an advantage in terms of providing more choice to consumers as they are allowed to sell imported items as well.

The proposal may also help Prime Minister Narendra Modi meet his target of doubling income of farmers by 2022.

In parallel, the government is considering allowing foreign food retailers to sell 25% non-food items of the total items sold to enable 100% FDI in food retail chains. Foreign supermarket chains have pointed out that opening food retail chains does not make sense as the profit margin in such businesses is thin, and the food processing ministry which is spearheading the proposal has recommended allowing some non-food items to be sold in such stores to make the model viable.

Akash Gupt, partner at PwC India, said the proposal to link foreign investment in retail to local manufacturing and sourcing makes sense as it will create manufacturing capacity in the country. “Multinational hypermarkets may be interested in opening stores in India under the model since they don’t rely a lot on imports and mostly depend on local supplies,” he added.

In April, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that the government is not rethinking its opposition to FDI in multi-brand retail. In July, the cabinet allowed all companies, including Indian supermarkets, to tap the equity market to raise foreign portfolio investment up to 49% without seeking the finance ministry’s approval.

By 2020, India’s retail sector is expected to double to $1.1-1.2 trillion from $630 billion in 2015 at a compound annual growth rate of 12%, said a report released by lobby group Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and PwC in September last year.

Backed by robust economic growth and rising household incomes, consumer spending in India is also expected to touch $3.6 trillion (about Rs230 trillion) by 2020, increasing India’s share in global consumption to 5.8%, more than twice its current levels, the report added.

**GST: India’s new tax reform to help PM Modi in achieving his digital economy dream** 

 ______ 
India’s biggest tax reform in history is also set to make its small-to-medium businesses more transparent. (PTI)

India’s biggest tax reform in history is also set to make its small-to-medium businesses more transparent. On July 1, as India rolls out its landmark national sales tax, businesses that make less than 100 million rupees — which the government refers to as micro, small and medium enterprises — will all have to digitize. The firms, often accused of conducting business mostly in cash and evading taxes by under-reporting income, will for the first time have to report every transaction, creating an online trail for the tax office. “Evasion will be checked,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said on May 18 after the government announced new rates for goods and services tax.

Currently many of the transactions by an estimated 51 million small enterprises are carried out in cash, with no trail of sales. This makes it easier for some to under-report revenue. The federal government hopes there will be a jump of 14 percent in revenue growth under the new levy as more taxpayers come into the fold of the formal economy and move on to digital modes of payment. It will bring an unprecedented transparency and create data for almost every monetary transaction in the economy, the government hopes, and this in turn will help expand the tax base.

“The incentive for cash transactions would reduce — now they will be able to take credit for the taxes paid,” said partner and indirect tax head, PwC India, Pratik Jain. “Also evading tax will be difficult as transactions have to be reported on GSTN portal. So the level of compliance should increase.”

Under Reporting

But the new reporting requirements could also mean chaos in a nation where about one-fourth the population can’t read or write and many offices do not have the technology needed to file digital returns. “The transition is going to be very painful,” the country director at the International Growth Centre and India’s former chief statistician, Pronab Sen, said in New Delhi over telephone. “It will take at least two-to-three years for them to settle.”

With just 38 days to go for the roll out, the micro, the small and medium sector that contributes over 30 percent to the nation’s GDP and 45 percent to exports is struggling to adopt the new regime. They’re bracing for a painful rejig where the change over to digital book keeping will also mean investing more money in equipment and tax consultants.

Several businessmen interviewed by Bloomberg News expressed concern over the new tax regime and said many would be forced to submit fake invoices if those they traded with did not upgrade their operations to report sales and purchases.

This would run counter to the government’s stated aim of reducing black money or unaccounted cash in the Indian economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to implement the new tax, which will unify India’s 29 states into a single market, comes within months of his shock cash ban last November. The withdrawal of 86 percent of India’s currency in circulation paralyzed small businesses, farmers, workers and shopkeepers who traditionally transacted in cash.

No Connectivity

Small and medium businesses employ over 111 million Indians. The government estimates 39.44 million or 87 percent of these are owned as private outlets with most concentrated in India’s eastern state of West Bengal and the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

“Digital payment has disturbed the sector,” Prakash Chand Jain, chairman of New Delhi-based Bawana Chamber of Industries said. “Small units don’t have highly educated owners, chartered accountants or even internet. The rural economy doesn’t have the culture of bills. How will this whole paraphernalia come into place? There is no connectivity. The government hasn’t even educated us”.

The threshold for exemption, designed to protect small units, was earlier pegged at 15 million rupees. It has now been slashed to 2 million rupees.

“Now they will have to compete with these big companies,” Rajiv Agarwal, senior vice president, Industrial Association of Uttarakhand, said over the phone. “In the first six months there will be a huge negative impact and some slowdown.”

However he predicts small units will witness significant growth should they choose to put their house in order. “They will have access to seamless market,” he said. “The self-imposed restriction on their growth to escape the tax authorities and hassles involved will go away with one tax system.”

**In praise of mainstream politicians** 

 ______ 
Donald Trump came to power on the back of his promise to “drain the swamp”. To the people who voted for him, Washington, DC was a cesspool of intertwined political and business interests. Culturally and economically, it had little in common with the country’s heartland. Trump’s lack of political experience and his transgression of norms of political propriety—personal attacks, not policy, formed the mainstay of his campaign—turned out to be his greatest strengths. His supporters were sick of the “Washington elite”. They were sending their man to, in essence, blow it all up.

Thus far, Trump has managed to blow up only his own administration. Appointing a respected, conservative Supreme Court justice aside, he has few concrete successes to his credit. Instead, he seems trapped in an endless cycle of scandals. Most of his problems are self-created. That Trump lacks political experience, and the astuteness in dealing with the bureaucracy, media and political opposition that comes with it, has been on stark display—from the manner in which he has responded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) probe into his administration’s contacts with the Russians to his indiscretion in compromising an Israeli intelligence asset, and a dozen instances besides. As Trump said about his first attempt at healthcare reform, he didn’t know the business of governing could be so complicated.

In the world’s largest democracy, meanwhile, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is learning a similar lesson. The India Against Corruption movement in 2011-12, helmed by Anna Hazare, was a wholly deserved rebuke to the corruption and ineptitude of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. But AAP, which grew out of it and achieved significant political success almost right away, has attempted to govern in permanent insurrection. Its attempts to continue trading on its outsider status are starting to come up short—from electoral setbacks at the state and local levels to infighting and dubious policy. AAP, too, is finding out that governing as an outsider is harder than campaigning as one.

“We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office,” Aesop supposedly said two-and-a-half millennia ago. Popular distrust of the political class has existed as long as organized politics has. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, it has found fertile ground in large swathes of the developed world. This is understandable. A witch’s brew of economic turmoil laid at the feet of the political and financial elite, the failure to take into account those on the losing end of globalization, and the cultural and demographic fears that always emerge in times of economic turmoil have robbed politicians of credibility. The reasons for distrust in emerging countries are different and older—in India, for instance, ineffective governance and the pervasive corruption that link politics with the shadow economy are responsible—but the end result is the same.

And yet, the political class serves an essential function. A republic such as India is essentially a mechanism for reconciling disparate and often conflicting interests and apportioning limited resources. Politicians are needed to lubricate the mechanism. Consider the most sweeping changes in the Indian polity. Decades of post-independence politics were shaped by the ideological struggle between the stalwarts of the Congress Socialist Party caucus—formed by Jayaprakash Narayan in 1934—within the Indian National Congress. The Indianization of socialist politics and its spread owed much to Ram Manohar Lohia subsequently setting himself against the Congress. Likewise, the sweeping changes in the dynamics of caste politics in India were brought about by politicians like Lohia, V.P. Singh and Kanshi Ram working within the political system. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee shifted the economic discourse to the right, he did so with all the skill of the consummate politician. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for all that he has often portrayed himself as a political outsider, is a party man through and through—and a consummate political showman and strategist, qualities he is exploiting fully to push another change of direction in India’s socio-economic landscape.

The merits and demerits of these changes over the decades are a debate for another occasion. But what they point to is the essential role of conventional politics in the life of a state as a means to mediate change. Compromise and the willingness to negotiate and cut deals might be unheroic qualities—and a source of frustration for the voting public—but they are also essential ones. A hard-nosed, take-no-prisoners approach sells while campaigning; it is problematic as a governing philosophy, as Trump is finding out.

In its most basic form, politics is a Hobbesian business of maintaining and managing the state’s apparatus of violence and coercion, physical, economic and otherwise. These are dangerous tools. There is something to be said for entrusting them to men and women willing to cut a deal on when and how they should be used.

**Kandla port to soon be linked with Iran’s Chabahar: Narendra Modi**

Ahmedabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday said the Kandla port in Gujarat will soon be connected with Iran’s Chabahar port, which will give a boost to India’s international trade and place the Indian port firmly on the global map.

Modi said this on the first of a two-day visit to Gujarat at Kandla in Kutch district where he laid the foundation stone for a dozen projects worth Rs993 crore.

India Ports Global Pvt. Ltd (IPGPL), a joint venture between Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and Kandla Port Trust (KPT) for development of ports overseas will develop and operate the Chabahar port. IPGPL is in the process of setting up two container berths and three multi-cargo berths.

Chahbahar port, located in the Sistan-Baluchistan Province on Iran’s southern coast is of strategic utility for India. It lies outside the Persian Gulf and is easily accessed from India’s western coast. It is located on the Gulf of Oman, near Iran’s border with Pakistan.

The Chabahar port will allow India access to landlocked Afghanistan and energy-rich Central Asia through JNPT and KPT-run ports on India’s west coast. India has also built a road link connecting Delaram with Zaranj in Afghanistan, which is adjacent to Iran’s border. Also, the port will promote Indian strategic interests in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz.

Kandla port, run by KPT, is one of India’s largest major ports (run by the central government) and the second largest among all the commercial ports in the country. Last year, it handled close to 106 million tonnes of cargo.

Kandla port will soon be linked to Chabahar port. “The linking will mean Kandla will cement its feet like Angad did,” the prime minister said referring to an episode from Ramayana where the character put his feet down in King Ravana’s court and nobody could move it however hard they tried.

The prime minister said if India wants to make a place for itself in global trade, it should have the best of arrangements in the port sector. The combination of infrastructure and efficiency is vital for the port sector to thrive, he said, adding that the Kandla Port has emerged as one of the finest in Asia and its rapid growth has surprised many economists.

Modi also suggested that the Kandla Port Trust be named after BJP-RSS ideologue Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, who he said stood for the uplift of all sections of the society.

Besides developing port facilities, Modi said his government was also working on developing a multi-modal transport system.

The new projects undertaken at Kandla are part of the ambitious Sagarmala project that shipping ministry envisages promoting port-based integrated development around all the major and non-major ports of India. Coastal transportation of goods and trade will be cheaper than by roads, Modi said. Developed ports are necessary for India’s recognition as a global economic power.

As part of Sagarmala, more than 400 projects, at an estimated infrastructure investment of more than Rs8 trillion, have been identified across the areas of port modernization &amp; new port development, port connectivity enhancement, port-linked industrialization and coastal community development.

Union shipping and transport minister Nitin Gadkari said the Sagarmala project of 239 projects worth Rs1.37 trillion was already in progress, of which 40 projects were in Gujarat alone. A smart city project is also proposed for Kandla which will create direct and indirect employment for about 50,000 people, he said.

**Rajinikanth fans protest in Chennai against groups opposing his political debut** 

 ______ 
Fans of Tamil superstar Rajinikanth went on a rampage in north Chennai on Tuesday morning against outfits who have advised the popular actor to stay out of politics, forcing police to cloak the city in a security blanket.

Rajini fan club members abused pro-Tamil outfit Naam Tamilar Katchi Seeman and Veeralakshmi, president of a little-known group called Tamil Munnetra Padai.

Around fifty of them congregated at Washermanpet but police prevented them from burning effigies of the ‘villians’ who dared to take on their Thalaivaa. Forty people were detained by police, who doused the flames after fans set fire to the effigies.

This comes amid intensifying speculation that Rajinikanth – whose fan base runs into millions – is thinking about joining politics. The rumours swept the state in recent days after the actor called on his fans to “prepare for war”.

The actor did not elaborate on what exactly he meant. But a close associate from his earlier days as a bus conductor told a local TV channel that Rajinikanth has made up his mind to join politics. The BJP has said it would welcome the 66-year-old actor and that he enjoyed a personal rapport with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Police have stepped up vigil across Chennai and Tamil Nadu following tensions, after many Tamil groups came out strongly against Rajinikanth, advising him to stick to films. Rajinikanth’s residence in the posh Poes Gardens colony in central Chennai was also put under extra vigil, with a team of 50 to 60 police personnel guarding the building round the clock.

Films are an emotive issue in a state that has seen several film stars turn politician and even become chief minister, such as J Jayalalithaa who died last December. There are hundreds of film clubs across the state and fans often turn violent if they feel that their hero was insulted.

**A speech in Lal Chowk or a ‘Mann ki Baat’, what Modi can do to heal Kashmir** 

 ______ 
In the two decades since I first went to Kashmir as a reporter, everything has changed — on the surface, anyway. In Srinagar last week, I struggled to find my old bearings: many of the buildings are new, most of them hotels and homestays. Some iconic old structures have been repurposed in more unexpected ways. I was astonished to find that the infamous “Papa-2,” where an unknowable number of Kashmiris were brutally tortured and disappeared during the 1990s, is now the official residence of Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti.

I remember feeling a bilious upheaval when I drove past the place on Gupkar Road in 1999, when I was working on a cover story on Kashmir for TIME Magazine. Since then I have been in, or in the close vicinity of, some of the world’s worst torture chambers, from Abu Ghraib, outside Baghdad, and Evin, in Tehran, to Scorpion, near Cairo. But there’s something especially egregious about torture practised by a democratic state: in addition to being bestial, it is also a betrayal, of values and expectations.

Driving past the green-and-white building last week, I felt… baffled. Who had come up with the idea of turning this symbol of state repression into the home of the state’s current elected head? It must have been a person, more likely a committee, with little understanding of politics, and even less of optics. It would have been much better to have destroyed the building, and replaced it with a park, or some other public space.

As it stands now, the repurposed Papa-2 is a symbol of something else: the superficiality of change in Kashmir. The conversion of its function has not altered the fact that Kashmiris feel deeply disillusioned about their place and future in the Indian state.

You could, of course, make a glass-half-full argument: at least there’s no Papa-3. In the late 1990s, much of the talk among Kashmiris I met was about the atrocities by the security forces, ranging from unexamined “encounter killings” and unexplained custodial deaths of accused militants, to gruesome punishments meted out in Kafkaesque prisons. In comparison, the security forces today exercise considerable restraint. The cruelty visited upon the previous occupants of Mufti’s residence is now unheard of.

But Kashmiris aren’t comparing their current condition with the worst years of the 1990s, and nor should they be required to. To their mind, pellet guns have taken the place of Papa-2 as proof that the Indian state cares nothing for their concerns, and is willing to inflict pain – and in some cases, blindness – upon them. The state may well argue that the pellets of today are better than the bullets of the past, but such gainsaying ignores the larger reality that parleys are better than projectiles of any kind.

Everybody I met in Kashmir agreed that dialogue, rather than pellets, is the only way forward in the valley. In the quest for complete candour, all of my discussions were off-the-record, so you’ll have to take my word that I met credible representatives of every category that counts: mainstream politicians, separatists, security forces, students, civil servants, civilians. They were unanimous that a political process is the only way out of the problem.

No change there: this was the consensus view in the late 1990s, and through most of the years since. Every Indian government that has tried to punish Kashmiris into submission has eventually accepted the futility of such an approach. I have no doubt that the current dispensation in New Delhi will do so, as well. But when? Everyone I met in Srinagar is of the view that time is running short. The differing perceptions of the latest symbol of the conflict in Kashmir suggest a hardening of hatreds that, if allowed to continue, will be difficult to soften.

Farooq Ahmed Dar became a symbol when, on April 9, he was tied to the front of an army jeep, and used as a human shield against a stone-throwing mob. He had, by his own account, gone to vote in the Lok Sabha by-election. But Dar’s plight brought him little consideration from any quarter. A parade of prominent Indians, including no less a legal luminary than the country’s attorney general, defended the army unit that mistreated him. On social-media platforms, hyper-nationalists pigeon-holed him as a Pakistani sympathiser who deserved what he got. And most telling of all, many of his fellow Kashmiris say it served Dar right, for being an Indian sympathiser who went out to vote.

Even when the two sides agree on something – that Dar got what was coming to him – it’s for the completely opposite reasons.

What’s the way out from here? Kashmir desperately needs new symbols. A good start would be a symbolic gesture: a visit to Srinagar by Prime Minister Modi, perhaps. A speech in Lal Chowk, offering balm instead of bellicosity. Maybe even a ‘Mann ki Baat,’ in which he chats with young Kashmiris speaking their minds. The opening of dialogue, first with the mainstream political parties, followed by a widening circle of the willing.

Gestures in other directions would help, too: a stern warning to BJP members and their allies who spout hate speech about Kashmiris; an appeal that Kashmiris living in other parts of India be treated with courtesy; an encouragement of other Indians to visit the valley.

Oh, and it’s not too late to tear down Papa-2.

**Al Gores climate change film gives India a stellar role** 

 ______ 
By Saibal Chtterjee

Cannes, May 23 (PTI) A powerful new documentary film about former US vice president Al Gores sustained campaign to encourage renewable energy use across the world, gives Indias part in the climate change movement a starring role.

""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power"", directed by the American directing duo of Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen, premiered at the 70th Cannes Film Festival yesterday.

At one point, the film shows Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his speech at the November 2015 Paris Climate Conference, insisting on continuing with conventional energy so as not to put up barriers in the path of development.

India is even referred to as ""the biggest holdout in the negotiations."" But by the end of the conference, the narrative undergoes a change, with India changing its stance and throwing its weight behind the Paris Agreement.

Gore, the central figure in ""An Inconvenient Sequel"", had a special word of praise for India.

""India is doing a commendable job in moving from coal to solar power to meet its energy needs,"" he said after the films world premiere in the festivals Special Screenings section.

Gores decades-long campaign culminated in the Paris Climate Conference in November 2015.

""An Inconvenient Sequel"" tracks the progress made by him in the ten years since ""An Inconvenient Truth"" put the global spotlight on the question of climate change and what needs to be done to reverse it.

Talking to the press, co-director Jon Shenk said: ""This film is about a truly epic battle between all those who have got us into the mess we are in today and those who want to do things in a new, sustainable way.""

For Al Gore, it has proven to be a powerful medium. ""When An Inconvenient Truth premiered in Cannes, I learned something I did not know before. Film is the most effective medium to deliver a message. The news environment is so messy and chaotic today that it is difficult to get focussed attention,"" he said.

While in the film he laments the distortions that have crept into democracy, he asserted that the climate change fight is now ""a hopeful cause because we have the solutions"".

""The solutions are available. It is important to summon the political will to identify and apply them,"" Gore added.

He said that ""the influx of big money"" is posing a real threat to US democracy. But he was quick to add: ""I have a great deal of hope that democracy will be revivified."" PTI CORR BK

455,"Matter of perspective. It's Modi's policy against Pakistan at work. At the heart it's not just foreign policy, but also dealing with an enemy state, who is your neighbor, has nukes and is sponsoring terrorism on your soil. It requires posturing, and every regime has its preference. Vajpayee tried the Gandhian approach. Manmohan closed his eyes in disgust and just sat there and Modi wants to regain lost ground and is moving into uncharted territory. 

This particular tactic was meant to test and raise the nuclear threshold between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has publically stated that it will consider nuking India if there is action within its borders. 

The respective countries administrations know the facts so the truth isn't lost on them, we are the ones who are speculating. There are credible reports that it did in fact happen. There was a sting operation where a police officer spilled the beans and then there were the much publicized dawn leaks after the Pakistani army and government got into a huddle about their strategy with regards to militancy. Cyril Almeida reported the facts about how rattled they are and the infighting and almost got destroyed for it. Mia Nawaz and ISI were at loggerheads about good terrorists and bad terrorists. 

In the end what happened?

Pakistan did nothing, they refuse to even agree that the action ever happened. The army knows today, that if they want they can enter Pakistan and take credible action against militant hideouts without worrying about nukes. The public knows it and the Pakistani public knows it. People got a reality check and out demoralised forces got something to cheer about. Posturing is important, especially with the next door bully. ",2017-05-23 19:43:47

**Modi: Narmada came to Kutch at the cost of poor** 

 ______ 
BHACHAU (KUTCH): Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people of Kutch to value each drop of Narmada water as budget meant for poor was cut to ensure large budgetary allocations to bring Narmada water to the arid district of Kutch.Modi was addressing a public meeting after inaugurating the third Narmada pumping station at Bhachau that will bring water for irrigation and drinking purpose to many parts of Kutch reeling under severe water scarcity since ages. Currently, 85% of the 647 villages declared 'scarcity-hit' this summer are located in Kutch.""When we told other states that majority budget allocation by Gujarat is made for water, other states would not understand. They would think Gujarat is a happy and prosperous state. But we know that over the years we have tried to fetch Narmada water to you by denying hopes and aspirations of many poor people by cutting allocations who could have been provided good schools, hospitals and food,"" said Modi.""Now, that Narmada is coming, the budget will be curtailed in the coming days. It will be possible to use funds for the priority areas of the poor. At this time, do not forget the poor, pledge to use Narmada water judiciously so that it greens your farms and brings prosperity not just to you but the poor as well,"" said Modi.Modi said that now that Narmada water has reached Kutch, it promises to change the lives of people in the scarcity-ridden state.""We have lived the fact that Narmada, considered the lifeline of Gujarat, has become our life. A week ago, I offered prayers at Amarkantak from where Narmada originates and today the waters have travelled thousands of kilometres to reach Kutch. The elders who have lived their lives battling water scarcity will bless us,"" said Modi.Modi also mentioned the new Bhuj bus port. ""It is a matter of pride that the Bhuj bus port is like the airport. When people of Kutch will come to Bhuj, they will take the word about Gujarat government's good work to the world"", said Modi who said that Gujarati might should be used only for development.

**Sudirman Cup 2017: India beat Indonesia 4-1 - Times of India** 

 ______ 
GOLD COAST (Australia): India dished out a dominating show to notch up a stunning 4-1 win over former champions Indonesia to keep themselves afloat for a knockout berth in the Sudirman Cup mixed team badminton championship here on Tuesday.After suffering an embarrassing 1-4 defeat against Denmark in the opening match on Monday, India desperately needed to win this contest against fifth seeds Indonesia.India rode on stupendous performances by K Srikanth, PV Sindhu and the experienced Ashwini Ponnappa , who won both the mixed doubles and women's doubles match, alongwith Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and N Sikki Reddy respectively to outwit Indonesia for the first time in team events.Both Denmark and India now have won one match each and the knockout berths would be decided only after Wednesday's clash between Indonesia and Denmark.If Indonesia defeat Denmark, it will come down to the number of matches, games and points as only two can qualify for the knockout stage from Group 1 D.India, ranked ninth, have managed to reach the knockout stage of the tournament only once during the 2011 edition, while in the last two editions they couldn't even cross the group stage.Starting the proceedings, the new pair of Satwiksairaj and Ashwini produced another gritty performance to eke out a 22-20, 17-21, 21-19 over Tontowi Ahmad and Gloria Emanuelle Widjaja in a mixed doubles match that lasted an hour and six minutes.Former World No. 3 Srikanth, who had reached the finals at Singapore Open recently, saw off Jonatan Christie 21-15, 21-16 to make it 2-0 in India's favour.Satwiksairaj and Chirag Shetty then suffered a 9-21, 17-21 loss against World No. 1 Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo as Indonesia gained a point.However, Olympic silver-medallist PV Sindhu then defeated Fitriani Fitriani 21-9, 21-19 in a 42-minute women's singles match to guide India to an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match rubber.In the fifth match, the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold runners-up pair of Ashwini and N Sikki Reddy then prevailed 21-12, 21-19 over World No. 15 Della Destiara Haris and Rosyita Eka Putri Sar to complete a 4-1 drubbing.

**Triple talaq: Why Sonia Gandhi, Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee are silent, asks Ravi Shankar Prasad** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Kapil Sibal for comparing the practice of triple talaq with Ram

2 Triple talaq is not the question of religion and worship, Prasad said.

3 He said that BJP has not challenged triple talaq in the court.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today mounted an offensive on Opposition leaders including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, BSP chief Mayawati and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee over the issue of triple talaq.

Participating in a discussion at India Today Editors' Roundtable, Ravi Shankar Prasad today said, ""Maximum number of suffers of triple talaq are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar."" ""Why Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee are silent on triple talaq? This is vote bank politics, Prasad said.

WHAT ELSE RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD SAID

Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""Triple talaq is not the question of religion and worship. It is the question of gender justice, gender dignity and gender equality.""

""We have not challenged triple talaq in the court. A Muslim woman, who suffered due to the practice of triple talaq, has challenged this. The Supreme Court sent us a notice. We only responded to the notice,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

Prasad further said, ""I am proud that the Muslim woman thought that she could go to the court when Modi government is at the Centre as it would stand by us on the issue of triple talaq.""

""Rajiv Gandhi bent on Shah Bano. Modi government is with suffers of triple talaq. We will not bend,"" Prasad said. Ravi Shankar Prasad had raised the issue of triple talaq during the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh. Facing questions at India Today Editors' Roundtable, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""Why should social issues not be raised in politics? Why only slaughterhouses be raised in politics?""

Ravi Shankar Prasad slammed Kapil Sibal for comparing the practice of triple talaq with Ram calling both as matter of faith. ""What does Kapil Sibal want to say with his comparison? Ram was an ideal being while triple talaq is evil practice. A comparison between the two is disgusting."" On the question of the Supreme Court clearing the deck for restoring conspiracy charges against BJP leaders including LK Advani and Union Minister Uma Bharit, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""I had been LK Adavni's lawyer. I believe there is no evidence against Advani. Till proven guilty every accused is innocent under the law. Our cabinet colleague will come out clean.""

""Modi government is working on the agenda of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas. The government came to know about Karimul Haq of Jalpaiguri in West Bengal. His mother died as there was ambulance to take her to hospital. He took a vow that he would take every sick person in need to hospital on his bike. He has saved lives of 2,000 people. PMO got into touch with him. The Prime Minister spoke to him. He is being given Padmashri. This is how we function,"" Prasad said. ""This country is as much of the Muslim as of Hindus or Chirstians. Our job is to provide equal opportunity to everyone,"" Prasad said. On the question of cow vigilantism, Prasad said that PM Modi has clarified it so many times that no one would be allowed to take law in their hands in the name of protection of cows. ""Some people don't like Modi. They don't like that he was born in a poor family and became PM and doing good job,"" Prasad said.

On the question if the BJP is warming up to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""We did not leave Nitish Kumar, he left us. Now he is in alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav, who and whose family members are facing charges of corruption. The question is how comfortable 'Sushasan Babu' is with Lalu Prasad Yadav.""

Is the BJP concerned about attempt by the Opposition parties to stitch a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar? Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""This is not Mahagathbandhan. This is an alliance of fear. They are scared of Narendra Modi.""

On the question of conflict with the judiciary, Prasad said, ""We have fought for judicial independence. There is no clash. But, we wanted to improve functioning of judiciary. We brought NJAC, which was set aside by the Supreme Court. But, we have accepted it.""

Later, Prasad questioned the efficiency of collegium system to appoint judges in the higher judiciary.

**For Anil Madhav Dave, work came first. Despite ill health, he spent long hours in office**

Anil Madhav Dave, whose selection as Environment Minister last July surprised many, died this morning. He was unwell for the last few months and functioning only partially.

Dave, 60, had contracted pneumonia in January this year and had not been able to recover fully after that. But he spent a long time in office on Wednesday, holding meetings. He had detailed discussions with a group of activists who had gone to Environment Ministry to protest against clearance granted to a genetically modified mustard variety.

In the evening, he had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I was with Anil Madhav Dave ji till late last evening discussing key policy issues. This demise is a personal loss,” Modi said in a message on his Twitter page, mourning the death of Dave.

Dave was supposed to go to Coimbatore today to attend a function but he complained of uneasiness last night and had to be taken to AIIMS. MoS in the Prime Minister’s Office Jitendra Singh this morning said Dave passed away following a cardiac arrest.

A Gujarati bachelor who lived almost his entire life in Madhya Pradesh, Dave followed a very regulated and austere life. He was a vegetarian, ate very little, and an avid yoga practitioner. He used to do yoga in the morning as well as evening, even if he was in office. A Rajya Sabha MP since 2009, Dave has been associated with a campaign for conservation of Narmada river since long. Last Monday, he attended an event related to Madhya Pradesh government’s Narmada Yatra in Indore despite his ill-health.

Before being appointed as Environment Minister, Dave had never held any official position besides being an MP. Though he was a student leader and was associated with various social causes including conservation of Narmada, his foray in active politics came only in the early years of the previous decade. He was considered close to Uma Bharti, then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and now Water Resources Minister in the union cabinet.

Dave used to espouse the causes of vegetarianism, organic and natural farming, healthy rivers and used to oppose big dams. Despite his genial personality and extremely soft-spoken manners, he held very strong views. One of his eight books is titled ‘Sambhal Ke Rahna Ghar Me Chhupe Hue Gaddaro Se (Beware of the traitors hiding within)’.

Before becoming a minister, he used to be a frequent speaker at school and college functions in which he used to talk about his idea of India. A great admirer of Swami Vivekanand, Shivaji and Chandrashekhar Azad, he used to invoke them repeatedly in his speeches and writings.

**Maha farmers in urgent need of loan waiver: Punia** 

 ______ 
Nagpur, May 22 (PTI) Congress leader P L Punia today that farmers in Maharashta were in urgent need of loan waiver, as the state witnessed more number of farmers suicides and more hit by drought than any other state in the country.

He also sought to know that if the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh could waive farm loan, then why couldnt its Maharashtra counterpart do so.

""The most urgent need and demand for loan waiver towards distressed farmers is more relevant in Maharashtra than any other state in the country. Most number of farmers suicides took place in Maharashtra and it is the most drought-affected state in the country,"" he said.

He was talking to reporters here over the NDA governments rule in the last years.

He said that Maharashtra chief minister flatly refused to provide loan waiver to distressed farmers, claiming that it would not leave any funds for the development of the state. However, there were a lot of expectations for loan waiver when the BJP promised so in the UP elections.

""If the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh waived loan, then cant it be implemented in Maharashtra, which is much more affected by farmer suicides, water scarcity and drought. Similarly, BJP ally Shiv Sena which had been raising this issue seems to be not serious about it. Had it been serious, they would stepped out of the government on the issue of loan waiver,"" he said.

The Congress spokesperson also said that the Modi-led government has failed in reaching out to the rural and agricultural areas.

The number of farmer suicides in the country has gone up considerably. Total 12,360 farmers committed suicide in 2014 and 12,602 in 2015. According to experts, the figure stands at 14,000 in 2016, he said.

Punia claimed that around 35 farmers are driven to suicide everyday in our country. And this is primarily due to drought, crop failure, price crash and excess rain. 72 per cent of the suicides are by those farmers, who possess less than two hectares of land.

""In Maharashtra, cases of suicide of 202 farmers, including farm labourers, were reported in January 2017, 202 in February and 233 in March, which came to a total of 637 cases. Financial assistance was given to (the families) of 224 of these diseased, while 138 cases were rejected. 270 cases were said to be under scrutiny,"" Punia said.

Similarly, last year 3,052 suicide cases were reported and 1,619 were given financial assistance and 1,066 were rejected and 264 were under scrutiny, he claimed.

""The figures indicate that most of the suicide cases in the country are from Maharashtra, informed Punia. PTI CLS NP

**India’s electric vehicles push likely to benefit Chinese car makers**

New Delhi: India’s ambitious plan to push electric vehicles at the expense of other technologies could benefit Chinese car makers seeking to enter the market, but is worrying established automakers in the country who have so far focused on making hybrid models.

India’s most influential government think-tank unveiled a policy blueprint this month aimed at electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, in a move that is catching the attention of car makers that are already investing in electric technology in China such as BYD and SAIC.

The 12 May report by Niti Aayog, the planning body headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recommends lower taxes and loan interest rates on electric vehicles while capping sales of petrol and diesel cars, seen as a radical shift in policy.

India also plans to impose higher taxes on hybrid vehicles compared with electric, under a new unified tax regime set to come into effect from 1 July, upsetting car makers like Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor.

The prospect of India aggressively promoting electric vehicles was a “big opportunity”, a source close to SAIC, China’s biggest automaker, told Reuters.

“For a newcomer, this is a good chance to establish a modern, innovative brand image,” the source said, although they added the company would need more clarity on policy before deciding whether to launch electric vehicles in India.

Earlier this year SAIC set up a local unit called MG Motor which is finalising plans to buy a car manufacturing plant in western India. A spokesman at SAIC did not comment specifically on the company’s India plans.

Warren Buffett-backed BYD already builds electric buses in the country, while rival Chongqing Changan has said it may enter India by 2020.

BYD said in a statement the company would have “a lot more confidence” to engage in the Indian market if the government supported the proposed policy. The company said it would look at increasing its investment in India but did not give details on how it would expand its business and market share.

High costs

While the Niti Aayog report has not yet been formally adopted, government sources have said it was likely to form the basis of a new green cars policy.

If so, India would be following similar moves by China, which has been aggressively pushing clean vehicle technologies. But emulating China’s success could be tough.

Electric vehicles are expensive due to high battery costs, and car makers say a lack of charging stations in India could make the whole proposition unviable.

The proposed policy focuses on electric vehicles, and is likely to also include plug-in hybrids. But it overlooks conventional hybrid models already sold in India, such as Toyota’s Camry sedan, Honda Motor’s Accord sedan and so-called mild hybrids built by Maruti Suzuki.

Hybrids combine fossil fuel and electric power, with mild hybrids making less use of the latter.

In doubling down on electric power India would be shifting away from its previous policy, announced in 2015, that supported hybrid and electric technology.

That could delay investments in India, expected to be the world’s third-largest passenger car market within the next decade, according to industry executives and analysts.

“All these policy changes will affect future products and investments,” said Puneet Gupta, South Asia manager at consultant IHS Markit, adding that most car makers would need to rethink product launches, especially of hybrids.

Economic gap

Mahindra &amp; Mahindra is the only electric car maker in India but has struggled to ramp up sales, blaming low buyer interest and insufficient infrastructure.

Pawan Goenka, managing director at Mahindra said the company was working with the government and other private players to set up charging stations in India. Mahindra was also focusing on developing electric fleet cars and taxis, Goenka said.

The cost of setting up a car charging station in India ranges from $500 to $25,000, depending on the charging speed, according to a 2016 report by online journal IOPscience.

While the proposed policy suggests setting up battery swapping stations and using tax revenues from sales of petrol and diesel vehicles to set up charging stations, it does not specify the investment needed or whether the government would contribute.

“For full electric vehicles, the economic gap remains huge and the charging infrastructure needed does not exist,” said a spokesman at Tata Motors. The company makes electric buses and is working on developing electric and hybrid cars.

Delayed plans

Most automakers have focused on bringing in hybrid models that are seen as a stepping stone to electrification. Toyota recently launched its luxury hybrid brand Prius in India, while Hyundai Motor plans to debut its Ioniq hybrid sedan next year.

Maruti’s parent Suzuki Motor, along with Toshiba and Denso, plans to invest 20 billion yen ($180 million) to set up a lithium ion battery plant in India which would support Maruti’s plan to build more hybrids.

But the apparent sharp shift in policymakers’ thinking in favour of electrification is forcing automakers like Toyota and Nissan Motor to seek more clarity before finalising future products for India, while Hyundai may delay new launches.

Toyota, the world’s No. 2 carmaker by sales, had planned to have a hybrid variant for all its vehicles in India, but the company’s future launches would now depend on the new policy, said Shekar Viswanathan, vice-chairman of its Indian subsidiary.

Nissan, which plans to launch a hybrid SUV later this year, said in a statement it was waiting for more clarity before deciding whether to bring electric cars to India.

A plan by Hyundai to launch at least three hybrid cars in India in 2019-2020 would likely to be delayed, said a source.

Hyundai did not comment on queries related to delays.

“If the government will be aggressive on electric vehicles and not support other technologies, companies will need to rethink investments,” said an executive with an Asian carmaker. Reuters

**Germany supports India’s OBOR stand** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Germany shares India’s concerns on China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative strategic programme as a “top down exercise”, German ambassador Martin Ney said here on Tuesday, days before the fourth round of inter-governmental consultations to be presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel “OBOR is very different from the ancient Silk Road. It’s not about free trade, it's a trade-enhancing measure by China,” Ney told reporters here. Defence, trade and strategic concerns will dominate the discussions between Modi and Merkel.Comparing the inter-governmental consultation process to a joint cabinet meeting, Ney said Modi would be accompanied by a number of his ministers. Germany, he said, is ready to sign a government-to-government defence pact with India, adding there would be many “substantial” agreements during the visit.Identifying terrorism as a major challenge, Ney said Germany stands by India in its fight against the menace and noted that his country had been sharing intelligence with the Indian government.Supporting India’s membership to the four export control regimes, he specifically endorsed India’s accession to the NSG Ney pointed out the absence of EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA). With India having killed off all existing investment treaties with European countries, new investments into India could become risky without any rules that protect investments. “India decided to terminate a whole series of bilateral investment treaties with individual countries.Effect of that on bilateral relations is not good. New investments into India have no rules and no protection,” he said. Recognising some of the steps India has taken towards ease of doing business, he said Germany had already invested Rs 53,000 crore into India since 2010.Ney said: “The core of the inter-governmental consultations is that Germany and India agree on fundamental principles of democracy and institutional principles ... both are members of G-20, want UNSC reform, support a rules-based order and freedom of navigation in accordance with UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).”Modi will arrive in Berlin on May 29 and head into a one-on-one dinner with Merkel.On May 30, he will get a formal welcome with military honours following which the two delegations will head into a plenary discussion and sign agreements currently being negotiated. He will fly out to Spain on the night of May 30.

480,"The BJP was the first to realize the changing face of politics across the globe. They hired the right people. The right PR groups.

481,"From the [TOI article in question](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nuke-mou-govt-makes-russia-sweat-before-pm-modi-putin-meet/articleshow/58707050.cms), 

&gt; a top official source confirmed to TOI, Russia's deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin took up the issue with PM Narendra Modi in their meeting last week.

...

&gt; India has **warned** Russia that it will stall cooperation with its foreign partners for development of its civil nuclear programme if it is unable to become a full member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in the near future. To make its point, it is **threatening** to put in cold storage an MoU with Russia for developing Kudankulam 5 and 6 reactor units.

TOI is GT of India now.  

Did this source (if its all true) really use the EXACT same semantics as mentioned in the article above.  
If so its incredible to me that such semantics could be uttered in a official diplomatic meet.  
If not, TOI needs to hire someone who understands the language its publishing these articles in.  

As for the matter. Its silly. India lacks Nuclear tech. It needs Russia AND everyone else there is, including China, which is now on road to become the global leader in this domain.  

And lastly this post's linked article is right. India doesn't need to behave like this for NSG equation. India already has the exception. Which it got because US lobbied NSG members (esp its Western allies) on behalf of India (as was part of the agreement that was signed between India and US, i.e. India made US get written assurance it would help India get the exemption).  
And China didn't object because it was isolated inside NSG because NSG requires consensus and everyone else was on board giving India exemption after US lobbied for it. 

Post that for NSG membership US hasn't done that for multiple reasons and naturally many Western members aren't really on board and this allows China the tactical space to operate.  

India's targets and lashing out is completely ridiculous. Focus on how it got the exemption instead of whining on things it can't change and in fact doesn't need to change. It doesn't need China. China will agree when the rest of 47 agree because China doesn't go against consensus on matters which aren't core to it and NSG isn't, because if it was India would never had gotten the Exemption.
