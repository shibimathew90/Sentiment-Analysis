**Reforms undertaken by India are significant: World Bank chief** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: The reforms undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been ""significant"" and the results would be reflected in the mid and long-term growth figures, the World Bank chief said on Thursday, days after the global lender forecast that India's GDP may slowdown to 7 per cent in 2017. ""The reform process has been significant. We think that certainly in the medium and long term, the growth will reflect the seriousness of Prime Minister Modi's government in making those reforms,"" Jim Yong Kim told reporters at the start of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank here.Kim was responding to a question on recent slowdown of the Indian economy . Both the World Bank and the IMF have downgraded India's growth projections.The World Bank had on Wednesday forecast that India's GDP may slowdown from 8.6 per cent in 2015 to 7 per cent in 2017 because of disruptions by demonetisation and the GST The IMF has also lowered India's growth projection to 6.7 per cent in 2017, 0.5 percentage points less than its previous two forecasts and slower than China's 6.8 per cent.Last week, the World Bank chief had said that the recent slowdown in India's economic growth is short-term and an ""aberration"" mainly due to the temporary disruptions in preparation for the GST.""Our team feels that the slowdown has been because of the waiting for the passage of goods and services tax,"" Kim said in response to a question on India's growth slowdown.""But the goods and services tax we have to understand is something that India has been talking about for a long time, well before Prime Minister Modi took power,"" he said.The goods and services tax is going to stop things like trucks being stalled for such a long time in transporting things through India because at every border they have to stop and go through a complicated tax process, he explained.""The goods and services tax would be very good for Indian growth , but for now the sense is that companies are waiting until that passes before really making investment and taking action. So, our sense is that this (slowdown in growth) is temporary,"" said the World Bank President.In his answer, Kim was very appreciative of the reforms being undertaken by PM Modi in the last three years.""Prime Minister Modi took a very different approach to our doing business report. And his approach was we are going to move up quickly and we are going to do the things that we need to do to reform the business environment,"" he said. The actions that Modi has taken are ""really quite substantial"" , he said.The Ease of Doing Business Report is slated to come out soon.""We'll wait to see what happens on the business report this year but we've been very encouraged with the reforms that he has already taken. He knows that there are more to do,"" he said.""I won't be specific about them because they have to prioritize them for the government, Kim said when asked what steps India needs to take. But the reform process has been significant,"" Kim said.

**Why Suppress Allegations, Says Shatrugan Sinha About Amit Shah's Son** 

 ______ 
Shatrugan Sinha is the first MP from his party to call for an investigation on
the Jay Shah case. (File)

Former actor Shatrugan Sinha has become the first MP from his party to call
for an investigation to determine if the son of BJP chief Amit Shah benefited
from crony capitalism. In doing so, the parliamentarian from Bihar continues
his trend of siding with the opposition against the BJP on mega issues.

In an interview to NDTV, the 71-year-old politician said, “When there are such
serious allegations, why try to suppress them? The truth must prevail.”

Jay Shah, an entrepreneur in Gujarat, has sued The Wire for 100 crores for
alleged defamation over its report that his firm’s revenue shot up by 16,000
times after the BJP won the general election. The report also referred to
unsecured loans.

Top union ministers including Rajnath Singh and Piyush Goyal have denied any
wrongdoing by Jay Shah. The opposition Congress has demanded an investigation
and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi must comment on the controversy.

Yashwant Sinha, another BJP veteran who has issued a blaring takedown of the
government’s handling of the economy, said yesterday that the BJP “has lost
the moral high ground” by not ordering an inquiry into the allegations against
Jay Shah. Shatrugan Sinha offered similar unsolicited counsel for his party.
Citing the Caesar’s Wife decree, he said, “You should follow honesty and
transparency and whatever allegations are being levelled, let there be an
investigation into this matter.”

Both the Sinhas are among a faction of leaders that have been relegated to
spectator seats by their party leadership. Shatrugan Sinha this morning said
he has been insulted by being overlooked for an important public event in
Patna which will star the PM. “It’s my constituency,” he said, describing the
slight as “enough is enough.”

His opponents in the BJP retorted that his commitment to his constituency has
been so below the radar that posters have appeared in the past declaring the
MP as “Wanted”.

**'Pessimists Are Going Global': Rahul Gandhi On PM Modi Jab** 

 ______ 
Referring to IMF and World Bank reports, Rahul Gandhi took a dig at PM Modi
for the economic slowdown

**New Delhi: **

After the International Monetary Fund and World Bank downgraded India's growth
forecast in their latest reports, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said
""pessimists"" who criticise the government's policies are not only confined to
the country, alluding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks earlier this
month that a ""handful of people"" were trying to

spread pessimism in India.

PM Modi's remarks came after former union ministers

Arun Shourie

and

Yashwant Sinha

criticised the government's economic policies.

""These pessimists are going global. Why don't they just go away?"" Rahul Gandhi
tweeted, using the IMF and World Bank reports to buttress his argument.

Mr Sinha and Mr Shourie had said the sudden withdrawal of high-value notes in
November 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax or GST -- two
major reforms of the Modi government -- have been badly timed.

Gross Domestic Product or GDP growth rate fell to 5.7 per cent in the first
quarter this fiscal, the lowest in three years.

The IMF also attributed the fall in India's growth projection to the two big
reforms. ""In India, growth momentum slowed, reflecting the lingering impact of
the authorities' currency exchange initiative as well as uncertainty related
to the midyear introduction of the country-wide Goods and Services Tax,""

the IMF said.

The World Bank shared a similar opinion in its latest report.

PM Modi has defended his government's policies. ""There are some people who
sleep well only after they spread a feeling of pessimism. We need to recognise
such people,"" he had said while addressing company secretaries on the
Institute of Company Secretaries of India's 50th anniversary.

GDP growth rate had fallen below 5.7 per cent at least eight times when the
Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power, PM Modi had said,
adding his government was ""committed and capable"" of reversing the setback.

24,"&gt; Here's the thing - the chance of India becoming a communist state, an anarchist state or a caliphate are all virtually nil. 


True, but we weren't talking about India here. I was comparing the Nazis and the Soviets, and the similarities in their methods and results, despite completely different motives.



&gt; To properly see the disastrous effects of communism you need a proper communist nation. 



I agree, CPI-M aren't really true Communists because of our Constitutional safeguards. But that doesn't mean people shouldn't criticise for claiming to adhere to the poisonous ideology.



&gt; Targeted mass killings in riots can happen and the government can look the other way, feign incompetence or help these rioters.



And when did that last happen? Has there been a significant uptick in communal violence under NDA? Was India amazingly stable and inter-community relations were perfectly throughout the length-breadth of the country under UPA? 




I know you will come up with 2002, but here's Jethmalani's [rebuttal.](http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/let-truth-be-known-about-modi) I will also add, have there been any subsequent riots, after Modi consolidated his power and control over Gujarat? 2002 happened in response to Godhra, when he was a leadership noob just elevated as CM. An incident like Godhra in a communally-sensitive region has a high likelihood of leading to riots, specially a couple decades back.




&gt;  Congress, BJP, CPM, TMC - the difference in what actually happens economically isn't that huge. 


I disagree on this. Sure, they are all Economically LW by Western standards, but that's to be expected in a democracy with as large an underprivileged population as India. However, BJP does have some sort of idea of what they are trying to achieve, versus a status-quoist and lacklustre INC. The Jan Dhan-Aadhar-DBT trinity alone, for instance, will be a gamechanger. I don't agree with Aadhar's imposition on everyone and not just welfare-recipients, but it's a small grouse compared to the massive savings from DBT. With BJP in power, we will move towards universal DBT, and potentially a selective-UBI. With INC, we will only further bloat our inefficient State.



&gt; There are 3 important axes imo:




If we are making it India-specific, I would add a Casteist (Specific communities appeasement like Mayawati's D-M-B or Lalu's Y-M formula) to Progressive (BJP's Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas) axe too.",2017-10-13 12:16:29

For a moment let's leave aside the partisan politics as it was 140 in 2013 and has never been too high. It's been 136, 133, 136, 140, 140, 131, 122, 105, 118, 120 between 2017 and 2007 in reverse order. Source is wiki. 

Let's also assume it's deteriorating under Modi, but that still leaves the question of absolute level low rankings before 2014. 

To my mind the biggest problem with media is the corruption within where the journalists put forward the motivated stories for some consideration, whether in cash or in kind. 

It's also true that the Government under all parties has shown vindictive streak.

However is media freedom really so badly curtailed that we are even worse than Cambodia where it's risky saying anything public against the regime. Or many middle eastern countries where it's impossible being critical to the monarchies?

Is it because of the murders of journalists in the hinterland (those which most of us haven't even heard of) by local politicians and goons?

I think we need a comparative perspective on why it's so bad. Modi and Hindutva might explain the decline (which is actually absent compare to 2013 ranking) but not the low levels throughout. ",2017-10-13 12:41:25

**Documentary on Arvind Kejriwal, An Insignificant Man, to release on November 17** 

 ______ 
A documentary on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has finally got a release date. Titled An Insignificant Man, the film will hit theatres on November 17.

Media giant Vice is presenting An Insignificant Man, produced by Memesys Lab. Directed by Khushboo Ranka and Vina Shukla, An Insignificant Man, is a non-fiction political thriller that chronicles the rise of Arvind Kejriwal from a social activist to the chief minister of Delhi.

The film was in news recently after it was stalled by the ex-censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, who had asked the filmmakers to get permissions from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians as there are references to these people in the documentary. Ironically, the film was championed by the international filmmaking community and senior executives at Vice. Finally, the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal overruled the board’s ‘unconstitutional’ demand and cleared the film in its entirety.

VICE presents: An Insignificant Man.



We are finally releasing in India! Watch it in theaters on 17th November. #Nov17AIM pic.twitter.com/oXUejYA6hu — An Insignificant Man (@aimthemovie) October 12, 2017

“I first saw the An Insignificant Man at TIFF in 2016 and I came away thinking it was the best doc about street-level politics since Marshall Curry’s Street Fight. We closely followed the filmmakers and the censorship battle over the film over the past few months. Vice will always champion independent filmmakers fighting for freedom of expression, and are putting our entire global platform behind this film. We’re bringing ‘An Insignificant Man’ to our audience around the world, because we think it’s a highly relevant film for anyone who sees problems in their own political systems and has the impulse to get personally involved in trying to change things,” said Jason Mojica, executive producer, Vice Documentary Films.”

Though the terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, the acquisition means the film will be shown in over 22 countries in theatres,on television and digitally.

“For the first time ever in the history of Indian cinema, a film will show exactly what goes on behind closed doors of a political party. Vice has led the content market when it comes to serious non-fiction work. They are fearless in what they do and it’s exciting for us to have such an inspiring international partner on board. We will be kicking things off by getting the film out in India this November” said Anand Gandhi of Memesys Lab.

The 95-minutes-long film has been cut and edited from 400 hours of real, behind-the-scenes footage shot through a year. It give us a sneak peek into the heated arguments, inside jokes, campaign strategies and the true events and ideologies that make up the rhetoric, as we follow the birth of the newest political party in India -- the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

**Aadhaar helped Indian govt save $9 bn: Nilekani** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: The Indian government's Aadhaar card scheme, which has enrolled more than 1 billion people, has helped the exchequer save about $9 billion by eliminating fraud in beneficiary lists, its architect Nandan Nilekani has said here.The system, launched by the previous UPA government, has been ""enthusiastically"" supported by the current government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, said the 62-year-old non-executive chairman of Infosys- India's second largest software services firm.It has really been a bipartisan thing, Nilekani said while participating in a World Bank panel discussion on Digital Economy for Development yesterday.He said that it is easier for the developing countries to leapfrog by building a right digital infrastructure.Aadhaar now has more than a billion people registered on its system, he said.""It has also saved the government about $9 billion in fraud and wastage because by having that unique number you eliminate fakes and duplicates from your beneficiary and employee list,"" Nilekani said at the event on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.""We have about half a billion people who have connected their ID directly to a bank account. The government has transferred about $12 billion into bank accounts electronically in real time to the world's largest cash transfer system. There are many many things like that.""I'm a big believer that if you build the right digital infrastructure then you can leapfrog,"" Nilekani, the former chairman of Unique Identity Development Authority of India (UIDAI), said.In the new world of data economy, identity authentication, frictionless payments, paperless transactions these are all very important layers of the new digital economy. That is what India has done, he said.India is the only country in the world where a billion people can do completely paperless, cashless transactions on their mobile phones using this infrastructure which dramatically reduces costs.""Once you bring cost down, automatically inclusion happens,"" Nilekani said, adding that there is a fundamental strategic way of looking at it.Now it is very clear that date is where the action is, he said.The infrastructure that India has created enables every individual to use his or her data for their advancement, which is fundamental. Herein an individual used data for their personal advancement, Nilekani said.""There is a fundamental inversion happening of the way we think of data, which is unique,"" he said, adding that this has a lot of implications for the bank and people in public policy who have to look at what's the new rules of the game in the economy.Responding to a question, Nilekani said the World Bank has really done a great job in internalising the concept of digital ID.A high-level panel having representation from about 15-20 countries met at the bank yesterday to have discussions on it.When one has this digital ID, one can authenticate oneself through a system and get the own data out, he said.Noting that in India the Supreme Court has declared privacy as a fundamental right, he said the apex court has also laid down a framework that even when the government need to achieve a state objective then they can circumscribe some of those privacies.""It says for national security, for prevention of crime, protection of revenue, or for social welfare,"" Nilekani said.But the court said, every time the government circumscribes the privacy, it has to be a law, it has to be reasonable and it must be proportional.Nilekani said that the question of how data use can address inequality has not been discussed enough.""When the internet happened in the West in the last 15 years... the West was economically rich before they became data rich,"" he said.But in developing countries people have become data rich before they become economically rich, Nilekani said.""So in a society where per capita income is $1500 and you are data rich, the business model is how do we create an architecture where individuals and businesses are able to trade in their data to improve their lives. That is the heart of the question.""If I as a consumer can use my data to get better loans, better education, better jobs and better skills, and if we can get a billion people to get access to that they will use data as the ladder to improve their lives,"" he added.

* BJP projected MODI as the savior to win the election. Who will Congress project? Rahul Gandhi? That guy is a joke.
* Bulk of the media was reporting against Congress in 2014 (partly because of bias and partly because of wrongdoings of congress aka scams)

**Narendra Modi tells US daily: Gujarat's malnutrition due to figure-conscious girls** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has attributed his state's high rates of malnutrition to vegetarianism and figure-conscious Gujarati girls.In an interview to The Wall Street Journal, an American news daily, Modi said, ""The middle class is more beauty-conscious than health-conscious-that is a challenge.""""If a mother tells her daughter to have milk, they'll have a fight-she'll tell her mother, 'I won't drink milk. I'll get fat.'"" he told the daily.Modi's response came following the WSJ question that ""about half of Gujarati children under five were stunted, or too short for their age, as of 2006, according to the latest available figures from the Indian government.""Among the industrial states with a high per capita income in India, Gujarat ranks pretty low on health and nutrition. It also performs worse than the national average and some of the poorer states on other human development indices. According to the third National Family Health Survey over 41 percent of Gujarati children under three years of age are underweight, which is worse than the national average. Over 55 percent of Gujarati women in the 15-45 age group are anaemic.According to Gujarat state officials, the WSJ said, Modi government ""ramped up spending on rural health workers who distribute food supplements to the poor to $340 million in the year ending March 31, 2013, from $37 million in the year ended in March 2007, and are working on programs to track the health and nutrition of pregnant adolescents.""Modi told the WSJ that his government ""will try to get a drastic change in this.""

**Aadhaar helped Modi government save $9 billion: Nandan Nilekani** 

 ______ 
WASHINGTON: The Indian government's Aadhaar card scheme, which has enrolled more than 1 billion people, has helped the exchequer save about USD 9 billion by eliminating fraud in beneficiary lists, its architect Nandan Nilekani has said here.The system, launched by the previous UPA government, has been ""enthusiastically"" supported by the current government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, said the 62-year-old non-executive chairman of Infosys -- India's second largest software services firm.It has really been a bipartisan thing, Nilekani said while participating in a World Bank panel discussion on Digital Economy for Development yesterday.He said that it is easier for the developing countries to leapfrog by building a right digital infrastructure. Aadhaar now has more than a billion people registered on its system, he said.""It has also saved the government about USD 9 billion in fraud and wastage because by having that unique number you eliminate fakes and duplicates from your beneficiary and employee list,"" Nilekani said at the event on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.""We have about half a billion people who have connected their ID directly to a bank account. The government has transferred about USD 12 billion into bank accounts electronically in real time to the world's largest cash transfer system. There are many many things like that.""I'm a big believer that if you build the right digital infrastructure then you can leapfrog,"" Nilekani, the former chairman of Unique Identity Development Authority of India (UIDAI), said.In the new world of data economy, identity authentication, frictionless payments, paperless transactions these are all very important layers of the new digital economy. That is what India has done, he said.India is the only country in the world where a billion people can do completely paperless, cashless transactions on their mobile phones using this infrastructure which dramatically reduces costs.""Once you bring cost down, automatically inclusion happens,"" Nilekani said, adding that there is a fundamental strategic way of looking at it.Now it is very clear that date is where the action is, he said.The infrastructure that India has created enables every individual to use his or her data for their advancement, which is fundamental. Herein an individual used data for their personal advancement, Nilekani said.""There is a fundamental inversion happening of the way we think of data, which is unique,"" he said, adding that this has a lot of implications for the bank and people in public policy who have to look at what's the new rules of the game in the economy.Responding to a question, Nilekani said the World Bank has really done a great job in internalising the concept of digital ID.A high-level panel having representation from about 15-20 countries met at the bank yesterday to have discussions on it.When one has this digital ID, one can authenticate oneself through a system and get the own data out, he said.Noting that in India the Supreme Court has declared privacy as a fundamental right, he said the apex court has also laid down a framework that even when the government need to achieve a state objective then they can circumscribe some of those privacies.""It says for national security, for prevention of crime, protection of revenue, or for social welfare,"" Nilekani said.But the court said, every time the government circumscribes the privacy, it has to be a law, it has to be reasonable and it must be proportional.Nilekani said that the question of how data use can address inequality has not been discussed enough.""When the internet happened in the West in the last 15 years... the West was economically rich before they became data rich,"" he said.But in developing countries people have become data rich before they become economically rich, Nilekani said.""So in a society where per capita income is USD 1500 and you are data rich, the business model is how do we create an architecture where individuals and businesses are able to trade in their data to improve their lives. That is the heart of the question.""If I as a consumer can use my data to get better loans, better education, better jobs and better skills, and if we can get a billion people to get access to that they will use data as the ladder to improve their lives,"" he added.

**Supreme Court puts governments Rohingya deportation plans on hold** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Government must balance national and humanitarian values, Supreme Court said.

2 Constitution is based on humanitarian values, can't ignore those innocent: SC.

3 The Centre in its affidavit had termed Rohingya refugees illegal immigrants.

The Supreme Court today deferred the deportation of Rohingya Muslim refugees from India till its next hearing on November 21 and said there is not an ""iota of doubt"" that a humanitarian approach should be taken on the matter.

In a strongly-worded observation, the Supreme Court reminded the government that it has multiple responsibilities, and must balance national and humanitarian values. It said the Rohingya Muslims issue is of great magnitude and the state has a big role to play.

""The Constitution is based on humanitarian values. The state has a multi-pronged role. While national security and economic interests need to be secured, innocent women and children cannot be ignored,"" the apex court said.

Deferring the matter to November 21, the Supreme Court, however, allowed the Rohingya petitioners to approach it in case of any contingency.

Earlier, the Centre in an affidavit had termed Rohingya refugees as ""illegal"" immigrants and said some of them were part of a ""sinister"" design of Pakistan's ISI and terror groups such as the ISIS, whose presence in the country will pose a ""serious"" national security threat.

ROHINGYA MUSLIMS LEFT MYANMAR TO ESCAPE PERSECUTION

The affidavit was submitted in response to a plea filed by the Rohingya immigrants, claiming they had taken refuge in India after escaping from Myanmar due to widespread discrimination, violence and bloodshed against the community there.

Earlier this week, a group of eminent personalities had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to not deport Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers, saying a proposal that the entire community is a threat to national security is basedon ""false assumption"".

In an open letter, 51 prominent names including Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, former home minister P Chidambaram, former Union home secretary G K Pillai among others, observed that as an aspiring global leader, India cannot afford to adopt a ""shortsighted approach"".

57,"Hitler was worse than Stalin, and Nazism is definitely worse than communism by a very wide margin. Does this mean communism is good or something countries should follow to build their economy? Nope.

&gt;people shouldn't criticise for claiming to adhere to the ideology.

Definitely. CPM is regularly criticized in India, and that's why they are politically irrelevant outside of Kerala. CPM brought a lot of misery to WB and are a big factor in de-industrializing the state (not the only factor of course).

On majoritarianism - the INC is pragmatically majoritarian, the BJP is programmatically majoritarian. On the subject of communal disturbances you can see evidence of BJP involved in majoritarian violence in the article you're commenting on, there are numerous such incidents in West Bengal.

The INC was an all-encompassing party consisting of people from a number of ideologies and ambitions, much like Tito's party in Yugoslavia. The Sangh Parivar's actions were usually ignored, outside of a few times after Gandhi's assasination or Indira Gandhi's time when the RSS was banned. The Congress never really did enough to deal with hindutva and in fact it often benefited them.

The BJP and hindu nationalism on the other hand is like Serb nationalism. The BJP is quite clearly the politically correct face of the Sangh, and at times they don't even need to be PC. Modi of course is the politically correct face of the Sangh and the BJP. Eternally a pracharak of course, and just a figurehead of the Sangh oligarchy that is in power. 

The most recent major communal riot was in Muzzafarnagar:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Muzaffarnagar_riots

&gt;Sure, they are all Economically LW by Western standards

Token sop populism is what all governments are. The primary goal of politicians in India is to get power and money - often via corruption. 

Neoliberalism happens because either: 

1. Politicians get massive kickbacks or make money
2. Indian industrialists funding political parties are happy
3. Appeasing the trader community/caste
4. The Indian economy is grinding to a halt

The CPM does this too. When the CPM got embroiled in Nandigram and Singur all the communist ideals went down the drain and hostile land acquisition and cronyism as bad as land deals in central India or Gujarat happened. Most of India has enormous levels of corruption involving land, and BJP ruled states are just as bad and often worse.

You keep trying to make the claim that India's right wing are some kind of benevolent cultural entity of soft hindu conservatism. Nobody outside of Sangh affiliated journalists and a tiny handful of international observers make this claim. Almost every single major international outlet of repute disagrees with this idea, across the political spectrum.

If you really are a centrist, or a pro-market progressive you should try looking at magazines that match this outlook like the Economist.

&gt;BJP does have some sort of idea of what they are trying to achieve, versus a status-quoist and lacklustre INC. 

This is an odd ridiculous thing to say after demonetization.

&gt;The Jan Dhan-Aadhar-DBT trinity alone

Aadhar is part of the creation of a surveillance state and an example of statism. I don't really have very strong feelings on the issue of Aadhar but if you are an anti-statist and opposed to government meddling in individual liberty this is a huge negative, not a positive.

The Congress initiated Adhar anyway - I'm not sure why you missed that. The congress was also completely okay with the creation of a surveillance state, the extent to which they were comfortable with right-to-privacy violations is probably slightly different.

The INC brought neo-liberal reforms to India. The INC's policies in combination with Raghuram Rajan helped shield India somewhat from the shock of the 2008 global financial crisis.

Elements of the INC were deeply corrupt, but that doesn't in any way indicate leftist or rightist economic thinking. And in BJP's India to think corruption is gone is quite naive.

Jan Dhan Yojana - just opening lakhs of bank accounts with no money in them is not really a massive achievement. It's a huge hassle for banks, but I don't see how having essentially zero-balance accounts helps in any way. India is very far away from becoming a digitized economy and the informal sector simply does not operate in the way people saying this stuff in the media expect.

The managerial approach of quick-fix solutions and ""tech solves everything"" is utterly idiotic and Modi (or whoever he represents when making these decisions) epitomizes this sort of thing by putting the cart before the horse.

Demonetization is a classic example of this idiotic thinking. Assuming demonetization wasn't for some specific electoral reason like the UP elections' funding - it was a hare-brained idea based on the ideas of a total moron (Anil Bokil) who has zero clue about economics and is almost like a deluded godman.

There are numerous other instances of India trying to use shortcuts instead of addressing the core issues. Swachh Bharat is full of this sort of thinking. Of course Swachh bharat is great for PR and photo ops.

Bullet trains are another example of this kind of idiocy.

You cannot progress until you get the fundamentals right, but we always want to skip ahead and take shortcuts.

Indian internet for example is utter garbage and wireline connections simply don't work reliably. Yet we stick with twisted pair 10-15 year old technology and then try to ride the hype train of embracing 3g and 4g bypassing the urgent need of upgrading the basic telecom infrastructure. There's no cable internet, no fiber optics and even ADSL wireline is in shambles. But India is the land of shortcuts and thinking that the latest tech will fix everything.

There was a recent news article about making a solar powered app to message sweepers if the garbage bins were full. Anyone that has any clue about India will understand how flat out retarded this idea was.

Of course the congress used to do this sort of thing too, the BJP just takes it up a notch.

Repackaging Congress's schemes doesn't make the BJP substantially better. 

And I'm not sure why you get the idea that the BJP is less statist than the congress, the are equally statist. You seem to echo a lot of libertarian and possibly ancap ideas. These are very american ways of thinking so wouldn't it make sense to look at how fiscally conservative people in America see India? 

&gt;I would add a Casteist (Specific communities appeasement like Mayawati's D-M-B or Lalu's Y-M formula) to Progressive (BJP's Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas) axe too.

Well tribal identity is everything in India. The issue is generally whether you are behind those with power and privilege which goes hand in hand with majoritarianism, or you want to make sure the underprivileged get fair treatment.

&gt;Progressive (BJP's Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas)

The BJP has always been the political party of upper caste brahmins, khsatriyas and banias (and jains). All of these groups have both privilege and power. The BJP has always had the label of a brahminist party with good reason, and their ideological parent the RSS frequently tries to eliminate tribal forms of worship by bringing them into the North-West Indian pure veg ram-hanuman mold. The assault on beef, buffalo and even goat sacrifice is an attack on Hindus who do not subscribe to the Sangh idea of hinduism - and this usually includes lower castes. The RSS being pro gau rakshaks makes them an unabashedly far right group.

Also, UP and Bihar's caste politics are not representative of the entirety of India. ",2017-10-13 18:18:12

**Gujarat takes to Rahul Gandhi warmly on his yatra: Will it translate into votes?** 

 ______ 
For a party plagued with infighting and rebellions, Rahul Gandhi’s witty one-liners will translate into votes, only if the Congress manages to capture and reflect the aspirations of the voters at the grassroots. (Source: PTI/File) For a party plagued with infighting and rebellions, Rahul Gandhi’s witty one-liners will translate into votes, only if the Congress manages to capture and reflect the aspirations of the voters at the grassroots. (Source: PTI/File)

In December last year at a public rally in Mehsana, a district where the local Patidars were angry with the BJP and a month after demonetisation, Rahul Gandhi read out a list of bribery allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi related to the Sahara and Birla group of companies. The script had already been read out by the Aam Aadmi Party so it did not seem to strike a chord with the north Gujarati crowd, notwithstanding Rahul’s visit to Umiya Mata temple which is the reigning deity of the Kadva Patidars.

Nine months later, on a road show in Saurashtra, riding a blue bus to launch his Navsarjan Gujarat (Renaissance Gujarat) yatra, the Congress vice president was walking in a different Gujarat. At the peak of the Navratri festival, traders were crying hoarse over demonetisation and GST, farmers over produce not sold, and heavy rains damaging crops, roads, and other infrastructure.

Gandhi’s itinerary, meticulously planned, included visits to several temples, including a walk up 600 steps to the Chotila hill to offer prayers at the Chamunda hill, a pilgrimage spot on the bucket list of every Kathiawadi, the Khodaldham temple – the reigning deity of Leuva Patidars–and the Dwarkadheesh temple.

Making pit stops along the way, drinking chai at a party worker’s home, Gandhi was swamped by people who wanted to talk to him, take selfies and even laugh at his one-liners. By the second leg of his tour in central Gujarat which ended on Wednesday, the BJP had galvanized its publicity machinery to pick faults in Rahul’s speeches.

Covering approximately 800 km across central Gujarat districts of Kheda, Anand, Vadodara, Chhota Udepur, Dahod and the Panchmahals, stopping for interactions and public meetings at 28 strategic pit stops along the route, Gandhi chose his words carefully as he launched a sustained and unsparing onslaught on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and the BJP.

Vists to Santram Mandir in Nadiad, Ranchhod Mandir in Petlad, Kabir Mandir in Dahod and Bhathiji Maharaj temple in Fagvel in Kheda and feeding a cow, were part of his second leg itinerary.

Taking a leaf from his grandmother and late prime minister Indira Gandhi, who had famously called herself the ‘bahu of Gujarat”, Rahul gave himself the sobriquet of ‘Son of Gujarat’, and left behind an emotionally charged narrative, that not only set the Gujaratis thinking but also earned him a standing ovation, when he chose to counter BJP’s `Congress-mukt Bharat’ rhetoric with, `I would never wish for the annihilation of the BJP’.

The audience consisting mostly of young boys and girls, heard him in rapt attention and responded to his rhetorical questions in a chorus. And, Gandhi interacted with them and proclaimed that “There is an undercurrent against Modi, Amit Shah and the BJP here in Gujarat.”

His speeches about women not seen in shorts in RSS shakhas, touched a raw nerve, provoking the RSS top brass to talk about its overshadowed women’s wing, the Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, and for the BJP to attack Rahul on his “foreign thinking”. While BJP leaders like Amit Shah spoke of Gandhi’s “Italian glasses”, the Gandhi scion spoke of his mother and her Italian roots and stressed on the competition posed by China in the sphere of generating employment.

Not reading from written scripts, this Rahul on Modi’s turf was not the faraway leader from Delhi who had come seeking votes for the upcoming election. Consciously avoiding the desperation of a party that had been out of power in Gujarat for over two decades, Rahul was directing the political narrative to blend with the chatter in the village and town nukkads and making it personal: “Meri pitai kar-kar ke unhone meri aankhen khol di” (Their relentless attacks have opened my eyes), he said at a gathering in Vadodara, to loud applause from a crowd where BJP unit members were present in their “personal capacities”. It was a gathering of invited businessmen, some of whom are primary party members of BJP.

Sample his concluding address in Fagvel, an OBC stronghold that Modi had picked in 2002 to launch the Gaurav Yatra. Rahul asked the audience — a mix of tribals and OBCs, “Have you seen a single Nano on the street in the last six months? That money (given to Tata) was yours, the land was yours, the water was yours, the electricity was yours”, he declaimed to a frenzied crowd that agreed with him.

Between Gandhi’s first tour leg in Saurashtra and second in central Gujarat, Modi also walked part of the same trail to Dwarkadheesh and Chotila showering goodies on Gujarat.

Throughout his yatra, Gandhi left no opportunity to leverage the alleged recent controversy surrounding Amit Shah’s son. At an interaction with university students in Vadodara, he addressed Jay Shah as the “icon of Start-Up India programme announced by Modiji”.

The yatra has done some good to the Congress party which has seen a series of defections to the BJP since the Rajya Sabha elections in August. For one, the rousing welcome Gandhi’s blue bus received across central Gujarat has rekindled the morale of the party cadre. At several places along the route, the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) came out in open support and felicitated the Congress President-in-waiting. Also, Rahul’s interactions have brought to the fore the visible anti-incumbency in Gujarat among rural communities who clutched at his outstretched hand of political assurances.

For a party plagued with infighting and rebellions, Rahul’s witty one-liners will translate into votes, only if the Congress manages to capture and reflect the aspirations of the voters at the grassroots.

Karnataka minister R Roshan Baig was in the centre of a controversy on Friday after a video emerged showing him hurling an expletive at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His comments triggered an angry reaction from the BJP, which demanded his resignation.

The urban development minister made the remark in his address to Congress workers of Pulikeshinagar assembly constituency, which has a large Tamil population, on Tuesday. The video clipping of his speech, delivered in Tamil, was aired by TV channels on Friday, triggering a storm.

“When Modi was voted to power as Prime Minister, his supporters said he is our son. But, now what has happened? He banned Rs 1000 note. Banned Rs 500 note. Now, these very same people are chiding him,” he said and went on to use an expletive. “It is not the Congressmen, but Gujaratis and Marwaris, who had supported BJP, who are saying this,” Baig said.

BJP Lok Sabha member Shobha Karandlaje said Baig’s remarks were only a manifestation of the “Congress culture”. She said Baig should apologise and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah should sack him as minister.

BJP spokesman Madhusudhan said Modi was the Prime Minister not only for BJP, but for the entire country. “Baig should mind his language. Otherwise, we will be compelled to hit back in the language he understands,” he said. Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal(Secular) supremo H D Deve Gowda said he disapproved of the expletive used by Baig. “Whatever maybe one’s emotions….one should not cross limits…one should speak about issues and mind the language used,” he said.

**'80% Of BJP Wanted LK Advani As President': Shatrughan Sinha's Latest** 

 ______ 
Being neglected by 2-man army, said Shatrughan Sinha in a reference to PM
Modi, Amit Shah

**New Delhi: **

Shatrughan Sinha, who earlier this year campaigned hard for veteran leader LK
Adavni to be nominated for President of India, today told NDTV that he was
speaking for an overwhelmingly large number of people in the BJP.

""80% of my party wanted LK Advani as President,"" said Mr Sinha, who described
Mr Advani as ""my friend, philosopher, guide, guru and ultimate leader."" In the
weeks before the BJP picked Ram Nath Kovind as its nominee for President, the
actor-politician ran a campaign on Twitter backing the 89-year-old Mr Advani,
a former deputy Prime Minister now sidelined in the party. When asked what Mr
Advani thought of his pitch, Mr Sinha said - ""It's not like we planned it.""

Shatrughan Sinha, 71, was part of a group led by Mr Advani that had in 2013,
urged the BJP against picking then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as its
presumptive Prime Minister. The request was rejected and Mr Modi led the BJP
to a big victory in the 2014 national elections.

Mr Advani was retired to a group of mentors soon after, restricted to
ceremonial appearances, and Shatrughan Sinha, a former union minister, has
found himself on the fringes, excluded from campaigns and important party
events. He frequently constructs confrontations with his party with his
critiques of its policies, but stated emphatically that he will never quit the
BJP.

""The BJP is my first, last and only party. I joined it when it had only two
MPs in Parliament. Why should I leave it,"" he said today, complaining,
however, that he is being neglected by what he called the ""two-man Army""- a
reference to PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah.

""I tried to meet the Prime Minister a few weeks ago, but he didn't give me
time. Even though, he did fly down for my son's wedding and I am very
grateful,'' said Shatrughan Sinha, also recalling how he tried to seek a
meeting with Amit Shah during the Bihar elections two years ago since he
hadn't been asked to campaign, and said even then he was given a cold
shoulder. ""I was the only one who didn't ask the PM or anyone else, even
Sonakshi Sinha (his daughter and popular actress) to campaign for me. And even
then I won with the biggest vote share.""

Shatrughan Sinha, or Shotgun as he is called by many, has taken on his party's
leadership in a fresh offensive over being excluded from a major event in his
constituency. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over centenary
celebrations at the famous Patna University on Saturday, also Mr Sinha's alma
mater, but the four-time Patna MP has not been penciled into the BJP's plan.

Karnataka minister Roshan Baig sparks controversy after using expletive for PM Narendra Modi

Roshan Baig, a minister in the Siddaramaiah cabinet, is facing flak over his use of an expletive to say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi bluffs on his monthly radio show Mann Ki Baat.

By Rohini Swamy |

A controversial statement by Roshan Baig -- a minister in the Siddaramaiah cabinet -- has landed himself in trouble.

Baig made a reference in Tamil aiming at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and used words which amounted to expletives. The BJP is furious and charged at Roshan Baig, especially at a time when the elections are a few months away.

Baig was addressing a party meeting in his constituency -- Shivajinagar -- on October 3.

While addressing the meeting, he talked about demonetisation and how the poor faced troubles during the drive, While referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Baig made a derogatory remark.

Baig compared a few schemes launched by chief minister Siddaramaiah like Anna Bhagya and Ksheera Bhagya. He then also made a reference in a slangy Tamil dialect where he said that the PM 'bluffs' in his AIR show, Mann Ki Baat.

Also speaking about BJP state president Yeddyurappa, he said, ""Siddaramaiah has implemented projects as CM. But Yeddyurappa, when he was CM, only looked at Shobha.""

""Baig must be having a lot of difficulties after demonetisation. He is expressing his pain and agony in public. The language tells the culture of the person. He must apologise to the nation for his nasty conduct,"" retorted Yeddyurappa in a statement.

Baig went into damage control mode and stated he knew only ""tooti-phooti"" (little) Tamil.

""I have the highest respect and regards for my PM. He is not just PM for BJP, he is the PM of the nation. I don't know Tamil properly and I just quoted what people, traders, supporters and marwadis said after the GST and demonetisation.""

""I never use such language and I have never used it against our PM. I don't use such words even for anybody. The BJP doesn't have anything to highlight, they are just raising questions against Congress leaders. Today they are targeting me.""

**Why No Gujarat Poll Date, Questions Opposition, Alleging Link To PM Visit** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi is expected to hold a huge rally in Gujarat next week.

**New Delhi: **

The Congress has accused the ruling BJP of pressuring the Election Commission
to delay announcing dates for the Gujarat assembly elections, alleging this
was done to allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""announce sops"" at a mega
rally planned in state capital Gandhinagar next week.

The Election Commission

announced dates on Thursday

for elections in Himachal Pradesh and said the Gujarat elections dates would
be announced later, though it did say that they would be held no later than
December 18, when votes will be counted for Himachal Pradesh.

The opposition has said this deviates from the practice of announcing poll
dates together for states where elections are due around the same time. The
terms of the present Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assemblies end two weeks
apart.

The terms of the present Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assemblies end two weeks
apart.

Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi also said the move created a
""ground of suspicion"" and went against the ""spirit of simultaneous polls"".
""What were the compulsions of EC to announce the poll dates for Himachal and
not Gujarat? They must have some good reasons to justify this. Mr Modi's visit
to Gujarat next week creates a ground of suspicion and its unfortunate,"" he
told

_The Hindu_

newspaper.

Responding to the Opposition charge, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said,
""Congress' statements on Gujarat Poll dates are unfortunate.""

""It would have been okay if a small political group would have said this
statement. But it is saddening that a party which has ruled the country for
several years is using the decisions for constitutional organisations for
their own political vendetta,"" he added.

BJP chief Amit Shah is also campaigning in Gujarat for the elections. (File)

""The Modi government appears to be putting pressure on the EC to defer
announcement of Gujarat elections along with Himachal to suit its political
ends,"" tweeted the Congress' Randeep Singh Surjewala, alleging that it was
done to ensure that a model of conduct - that does not allow announcement of
sops - would not be enforced before PM Modi's rally.

""The reason is that the Prime Minister is visiting Gujarat on October 16 as a
'false Santa Claus' to announce sops and '

_jumlas_

' that he didn't implement for 22 years. Onus lies on the EC to ensure level
playing field by announcing Gujarat election dates and imposing the Model Code
of Conduct immediately,"" Mr Surjewala said.

The Congress leader said if the Prime Minister had gone to Gujarat after poll
dates were announced, he would have gone there as a campaigner and would not
have been able to make populist announcements.

An independent body like the Election Commission must not ""come under pressure
like this,"" the Congress leader said,

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has been campaigning for the party in
Gujarat. (File)

While announcing poll dates for Himachal Pradesh, Chief Election Commissioner
AK Joti was asked by reporters why dates for Gujarat were announced. Mr Joti
said that while people in Himachal Pradesh sought polling before harsh winter
set in in the hill state, the Gujarat government had requested that it be
allowed to finish several relief and rehabilitation works following floods in
the state, before the code of conduct was enforced.

There was ""no justification"" to have a prolonged period of imposition of model
code of conduct as it could hamper development work, Mr Joti said.

Elections will be held for Himachal Pradesh's 68 assembly seats polls on
November 9 and votes will be counted on December 18, the Election Commission
said yesterday.

Both of these have been demonstrated to be false. The first one through demonetization. The second one through gst.

**Bihar should be among prosperous states in 2022: PM Narendra Modi in Patna** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Lauding the efforts of Bihar's Patna University , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that ""when India will be celebrating 75 years of Independence in 2022, Bihar should be among prosperous states of the country.""Speaking at centenary celebrations of Patna University, PM Modi said, ""I consider it my honour to visit Patna University and be among the students. I bow to this land of Bihar. This university has nurtured students who have contributed greatly to the nation.""The Prime Minister also praised Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the commitment towards the progress of Bihar.""The commitment of Nitish Kumar towards the progress of Bihar is commendable. We in the Centre attach topmost importance to the development of eastern India,"" he said, adding, ""Bihar is blessed with both Gyaan and Ganga. This land has a legacy that is unique.""Batting for innovativons, he said, ""From conventional teaching, our universities need to move towards innovative learning.Living in an era of globalisation, we need to understand the changing trends across the world and the increased spirit of competitiveness. In that context India has to make its place in the world.""He also urged youngsters to think about innovative solutions to the problems faced by people around them.Earlier today, PM Modi shared the stage with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for the first time after the the JD(U) returned to the NDA fold.This is the prime minister's first full-fledged official tour to the state since the BJP became a part of the ruling coalition in Bihar in July this year after Kumar-led JD(U) snapped its alliance with Lalu Prasad's RJD and the Congress.In August, Modi along with Nitish Kumar had made an aerial survey of the flood-hit districts of Bihar.The prime minister had promised a ""package"" of Rs 1.25 lakh crore in 2015 for the state during the campaign for the assembly elections in which the BJP and the JD(U) were pitted against each other.The two parties remained partners in Bihar for 17 years but the JD(U) severed ties in mid-2013 over elevation of Modi as BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate.Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who was among the dignitaries at the PU function today, told reporters, ""I am not here as a minister but as a proud alumnus of this glorious university. And I am proud that the Prime Minister of the country is attending a function at my alma mater"".Other Union Ministers present at the ceremony included Ram Vilas Paswan, Ashwini Chaubey and Upendra Kushwaha.After attending the Patna University function, the Prime Minister will fly to Mokama, which is in Patna district about 100 km from the capital city. Modi will launch a number of development projects there. He will also launch development projects worth over Rs 3,700 crore during the visit.

**'Modi Wave' Has Waned, BJP Rely On 'Sympathy Wave': Uddhav Thackeray** 

 ______ 
Uddhav Thackeray said the BJP gets a ""stomach ache"" if the Shiv Sena becomes
politically strong.

**Mumbai: **

Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav
Thackeray claimed on Friday that the 'Modi wave' has waned and that the BJP
now relies on ""sympathy wave"" to win elections.

He said the national party gets a ""stomach ache"" if the Shiv Sena becomes
politically strong.

The BJP narrowed the gap between its tally with that of the Sena in the cash-
rich Mumbai civic body as its nominee won the BMC bypoll from Bhandup, beating
the bickering ally's candidate by 4,792 votes on Thursday.

However, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party today got a boost when six corporators
of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation of the Raj Thackeray-headed
Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) joined it.

""The Modi wave has waned now. The BJP has to rely on sympathy wave to win
polls and bypolls. If they (the BJP) get stomach ache with our increased
strength, what kind of allies are they?"" Mr Thackeray asked.

The BJP's victorious candidate in Bhandup, Jagruti Patil, is the daughter-in-
law of corporator Pramila Patil, whose death necessitated the bypoll.

He was addressing the media after inducting six MNS corporators into the Shiv
Sena fold.

Uddhav Thackeray rejected suggestions that the Shiv Sena ""poached"" MNS
corporators and said such incidents had taken place in Arunachal Pradesh and
Goa (both ruled by the BJP).

""People should not level allegations of poaching. If others do it, it amounts
to self-respect and if we do it, it becomes betrayal? Poaching took place in
Arunachal Pradesh and Goa. What happened today was just

_'ghar wapsi'_

(homecoming),"" Uddhav Thackeray said.

There were no ulterior motives behind inducting the MNS corporators and it was
done only after they expressed their desire to join the Shiv Sena, he said.

**Rahul Gandhi Supported Ishrat Jahan', Says Yogi Adityanath In Gujarat** 

 ______ 
Yogi Adityanath said problems like naxalism, terrorism and corruption are
Congress' ""gifts"" to the nation

**New Delhi: **

Setting the tone for the election campaign in Gujarat that is expected to go
to polls in December, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday
launched a sharp attack on the Congress, describing its lead campaigner

Rahul Gandhi

a supporter of destruction, not development.

""He is not a supporter of development, but a supporter of destruction. Rahul
Gandhi has supported Ishrat Jahan, a terrorist who was killed by security
forces here (in 2004),"" the saffron-robed Chief Minister told a rally in south
Gujarat's Valsad district, according to news agency Press Trust of India.
Ishrat Jahan and three others, suspected to be Lashkar terrorists, were killed
in an alleged fake encounter in Gujarat in June 2004.

The Chief Minister,

who was in Kerala last week

to campaign against what the BJP says is the ruling CPM's ""murder politics"",
is in Gujarat for campaigning. Seen as the BJP's Hindutva face, Yogi
Adityanath toured the industrial clusters in south Gujarat that have a large
population of migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, he will move to
Kutch region.

Rahul Gandhi, who is leading the Congress effort to dislodge the BJP which has
been in power uninterrupted for over 20 years, was his prime target. The
Congress leader often mocks PM Modi for his

Gujarat model of development.

The Chief Minister asked people not to have any hopes of development from the
Congress that he said was a ""symbol"" as well as the ""messiah"" of destruction.
He said there was little to expect from Rahul Gandhi who had not been able to
develop his Lok Sabha constituency for a long period.

""In the last 14 years, being an MP from Uttar Pradesh, he has not even built
an office of the district collector. What can you expect from such a person
for development of Gujarat?"" he said.

Lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also reminded people that when the
floods came in Gujarat earlier this year, it was PM Modi and BJP president
Amit Shah who had reached out.

""When Saurashtra was flooded,

you went to Italy.

Prime Narendra Modi comes here, Amit Shah (BJP) president) comes here, but you
cannot visit people at that time,"" he said, calling the country's big problems
such as naxalism, terrorism and corruption as ""gifts"" of the Congress to the
nation.

**GST rates on restaurants likely to be lowered in November**

The goods and services tax (GST) on restaurants, including those in luxury hotels, is likely to be reduced next month.

A five-member ministerial panel set up by the federal indirect tax body, the GST Council, is expected to examine a proposal for reducing tax rates on restaurants at its first meeting on Sunday.

The panel’s recommendations will be placed before the GST Council at its 9 November meeting in Guwahati, a person aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.

The Council is open to lowering the 18% tax on air-conditioned restaurants and 12% on non-air-conditioned ones as policymakers appreciate that these tax rates have created an unpleasant impression on consumers about the tax reform.

“It is bad optics,” said the person cited above.

Prior to the rollout of GST from 1 July, a service tax of 15% was levied on 40% of the food bills at restaurants, which worked out to 6% of the total food bill. In addition, states used to levy their own value-added tax.

While determining the GST rate on restaurants, the Council considered that in the new regime, more tax rebates will be available to restaurants, which would help avoid any increase in the tax burden on consumers.

Another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many restaurants chose not to pass on the benefit of tax rebates to consumers.

The members of the ministerial panel—Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, Jammu and Kashmir finance minister Haseeb Drabu, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Chhattisgarh commercial taxes minister Amar Agrawal—are likely to meet a second time before the 9 November Council meeting.

The terms of reference given to the panel for examination include “the tax structure of different categories of restaurants, with a view to their possible rationalization or reduction”. The Council had originally kept the GST rate on restaurants housed in hotels rated five stars and above at 28% but subsequently lowered it to 18% in June.

The panel will also examine if the liberal scheme of quarterly tax payment available to small businesses could be made available to those engaged in inter-state supply of goods.

At its next meeting, the Council is also expected to examine lowering tax rates on a few other items as well, based on industry representations received so far.

At its last meeting, the GST Council decided to lower tax rates on 27 products, change rules to ease the compliance burden of small and medium enterprises and ease procedures so that exporters’ liquidity improves. The relaxation was in response to economic growth easing to 5.7% in the June quarter, the slowest pace in three years, from 6.1% in the preceding three months. Businesses slowing production ahead of GST’s rollout and the aftershocks of last November’s demonetization led to the deceleration in growth.

A finance ministry statement on Friday, however, quoted minister Arun Jaitley to say that there was clear evidence that the slowdown effects of demonetization and GST have now more or less played themselves out and that the economy is poised for strong and balanced growth.

**5 Accused Of Carrying Beef Thrashed Near Delhi, Case Against Them** 

 ______ 
Five people were beaten in Faridabad on suspicion of carrying beef.

**FARIDABAD: **

Five people were thrashed by cow vigilantes on the outskirts of the national
capital Delhi on the suspicion of carrying beef, according to news agency ANI.

Faridabad police, however, has registered a case against the victims under the
state's cow smuggling law. ""We will get meat tested,"" the district police
chief said.

A senior police officer of the district said a case would be registered on the
complaint of the victims too.

The family of the victims has denied that the meat they were carrying in an
auto rickshaw was cow meat.

The assault comes just a month after the Supreme Court delivered a strong
message on cow vigilantism and told states to crack down to curb the
increasing instances of cow vigilantism.

A few days back, RSS Mohan Bhagwat had stressed on a distinction between
""pious"" gau rakshaks, or cow protectors and criminals.

""People who are criminal and involved in violent activities should be bothered
about that (remarks from Supreme Court and PM Modi),"" Mr Bhagwat had said in
his speech on the Sangh's foundation day.

**BJP once again turns to Ram to bolster flagging appeal in Uttar Pradesh** 

 ______ 
The reason why the UP election results in May were a showpiece for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was that they represented, in the party's opinion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's continuing forward march. Yet, the overblown nature of this self-congratulatory assessment will be evident if the outcome of the five elections which took place at the time are taken into consideration. A more realistic picture will be available if all the results are taken together, for it will show that the original verdict was 3-2 in the Congress's favour with an outright win in Punjab and emerging as the largest party in Goa and Manipur.



Prime Minister Narendra Modi

It is another matter that what the Congress won in the swings, it lost in the roundabouts because a nimble-footed BJP managed to lure away a sufficient number of MLAs to its side to rob the Congress of its No.1 position in the Goa and Manipur assemblies. But if the BJP had been humble enough to look at the results in their entirety, then it might not have gloated over its success in UP. That election was one which the BJP could not but win because its principal opponent, the Samajwadi Party (SP), had shot itself in the foot via its internal factional battles.

It was the belief, however, that the BJP had decimated the opposition in the country's largest state which apparently made the party commit what may turn out to be a fateful mistake by choosing one of the most hawkish of the hardliners to be the Chief Minister. True, Yogi Adityanath has toned down some of his utterances in deference to Modi's ""development for all"" rhetoric. But it is as an administrator that his inadequacies have come to the fore, thereby showing that devotion to the saffron cause may give a leg-up while climbing the official ladder, but it doesn't help in running the government.

Since law and order in UP has always been dismal, it will be unfair to blame the present government for its failures on this count. But what has attracted countrywide attention are the deaths of scores of children in the state's hospitals. Considering that UP once witnessed a Rs 9,000 crore (over $1 billion) scam in connection with a rural health programme when two Chief Medical Officers were killed and their deputy died in custody, the latest tragedy may appear to be a part of a dreadful pattern. But its hurtful impact on the Chief Minister and his party cannot be denied.

To make matters worse, the upsurge of student demonstrations in Banaras Hindu University (BHU) over what the Vice Chancellor initially dismissed as an incident of eve-teasing has been seen as yet another evidence of dissatisfaction with the ruling dispensation. The unrest in BHU has followed the defeat of the BJP's affiliate, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), in student union elections in Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University, Hyderabad University, Gauhati University and elsewhere. The Vice Chancellor's ouster has been sought by, among others, the National Commission for Women, but a BJP government can hardly be expected to remove someone with a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) background.

There is little doubt, however, that episodes such as these have deprived the BJP of much of the sheen of its victory in less than six months. The party will be wary, therefore, of the reports that the rift in the SP between Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav has healed. It is the rupture between father and son which had contributed largely to the BJP's success by undermining its biggest challenger.

But it isn't only the reconciliation which will be of concern to Yogi Adityanath and Co. Of even greater worry will be the possibility of the SP under Akhilesh teaming up with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to take on the BJP. Akhilesh has been talking of such an alliance for quite some time although his father is against it. But now that the son is fully in control of the party, a tie-up between the SP and the BSP is a distinct possibility, not least because the two know that the BJP cannot be unseated otherwise.

The SP-BSP combination's advantage is that their combined vote share of 44 per cent in the last assembly election -- the SP 21.8 and the BSP 22.2 -- is higher than the BJP's 39.7 per cent. If the Congress's 6.3 per cent is added to the SP-BSP's 44, then the trio becomes a formidable force. It was only to be expected, therefore, for Yogi Adityanath to turn to building a 100-metre tall statue of Lord Ram on the banks of the Saryu river to boost the BJP's fortunes.

Since he appears incapable of providing efficient governance, recourse to religion to consolidate the Hindu vote is the only way out for the Chief Minister and his party. There are also reports that he will be fielded by the BJP as a campaigner in the upcoming elections in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat to rev up the party's position with a strong dose of Hindutva at a time when the economic slowdown has robbed Modi's 'vikas' (development) slogan of much of its appeal. The BJP has probably never felt the need for a saffron hawk more than at present.

**Rs 10,000 crore will be given to top 10 universities to make them world-class: Narendra Modi** 

 ______ 
Lamenting that no Indian university figures among the top 500 globally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the government intends to unshackle these institutions and provide Rs 10,000 crore to 20 varsities to ensure that they are counted among the best in the world.

Addressing a function on the centenary celebrations of the Patna University here, he said measures like grant of central status were ""a thing of the past"" and his government has taken ""a step forward"" towards making 10 private universities and 10 government ones world class.

""My government took an important step towards unshackling the IIMs, freeing them from the clutches of restrictions and regulations set by the government.

""We intend to do the same for our universities and ensure that our centres of higher learning figure among the best 500 in the world,"" Modi said here.

In his speech that lasted a little over 30 minutes, the Prime Minister stressed on the need for universities to give more emphasis on ""learning and innovation"" and give up old teaching methods which focused on ""cramming students' minds with information"".

The Prime Minister also replied in his characteristic style to a fervent plea by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who in his welcome address had urged Modi ""with folded hands that central status be granted to Patna University"".

""I would like to say something about a demand that was raised here and met with loud cheers by the young crowd attending this ceremony. Issues like grant of central status have become a thing of the past. We are taking a step forward.

""We will provide an assistance of Rs 10,000 crore to 10 private universities and an equal number of government ones for a period of five years. All these universities have to do is to demonstrate their potential to become world class,"" he said.

The universities will not be selected by the prime minister or a chief minister or any other political figure, he said, adding their potential will be assessed by a professional, third party agency.

""I exhort Patna University to seize this opportunity,"" he said in the presence of a host of dignitaries, which included Kumar and his Deputy Sushil Kumar Modi.

Hailing the role of young IT professionals in changing the global outlook towards India, Modi quipped ""earlier we were seen as a land of snake charmers, exorcism and superstitions.

""Long back, while on a visit to Taiwan, I told a friend that we, as a nation, have moved from snakes to the mouse,"" he said.

Modi said, ""We are a nation of 800 million young people, 65 per cent of our population is below the age of 35 years. There is nothing that we cannot achieve with such a huge demographic advantage.""

The PM began his speech on a humorous note, saying ""the Chief Minister said in his speech that I was the first Prime Minister to visit this university. It seems my predecessors have left quite a few tasks for me"".

He also paid rich tributes to the rich and glorious history of Bihar, saying ""the stream of knowledge that flows through this state is as ancient as the river Ganges itself"".

""The state has been devoting itself to the worship of Saraswati (Goddess of learning). But the time has come to propitiate Laxmi (Goddess of wealth and prosperity) as well and make the state a prosperous one by 2022, when we celebrate 75 years of our Independence,"" he said

He also remarked ""there is no state in the country where one does not find a Patna University alumnus among the top five bureaucrats. I have had the opportunity to work with many such bright officers"".

Union Ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan, Ashwini Chaubey and Upendra Kushwaha were among those present during the event.

After attending the PU function, the PM paid an unscheduled visit to the Bihar Museum, situated adjacent to the Patna High Court, which has been a pet project of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

The chief minister accompanied Modi during the museum visit.

This is the prime minister's first full-fledged official tour to the state since the BJP became a part of the ruling coalition in Bihar in July this year after Kumar-led JD(U) snapped its alliance with Lalu Prasad's RJD and the Congress.

**Vacate bungalows or pay rent 15 times the market rate, Bihar asks ex-ministers** 

 ______ 
The Bihar building construction department (BCD) has served notices on former ministers, including former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, to vacate their official residences immediately or pay rent 15 times the standard market rate of the premises.

“Except former minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui, all other ex-ministers who were provided accommodation by the BCD, have not vacated their bungalows,” said BCD minister Maheshwar Hazari. As per norms, former ministers are liable to pay in lakhs as monthly rent if they decline to move out of the premises immediately.

This is the second time when the BCD has served notices on them to vacate the bungalows. A month after Nitish Kumar parted ways with the Grand Alliance comprising the RJD and Congress and took oath as chief minister on July 27 early this year to form an NDA government with support from the BJP and its allies, the BCD asked the ministers belonging to the RJD and the Congress to vacate the houses.

At present, many ministers of the new dispensation, mostly belonging to the BJP, are compelled to reside and discharge their duties either out of their own flats or small houses provided from the state legislature quota. Urban development minister Suresh Sharma said he was facing a lot of inconvenience in meeting people and officials at home as he was staying in a flat of an apartment.

Tejashwi and his elder brother and former health minister Tej Pratap Yadav are occupying spacious bungalows adjacent to the chief minister’s official residence.



The Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government had earlier turned down Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s plea to allow him to retain the bungalow alloted to him when he was the deputy chief minister.

The 5, Deshratna Marg bungalow of Tejashwi has now been alloted to Sushil Kumar Modi, the Deputy Chief Minister in the JD(U)-BJP coalition government.

**'Was Told To Chant Jai Hanuman': 5 Beaten Up Near Delhi Over Beef Charges** 

 ______ 
Five people were beaten in Faridabad on suspicion of carrying beef.

**FARIDABAD: **

Five people were thrashed by cow vigilantes in Faridabad on the outskirts of
the national capital Delhi on Friday morning on the suspicion of carrying beef
in an auto rickshaw. Azad, the rickshaw driver who had been hired to deliver
the meat, bore the brunt of the attack.

The incident took place on Friday morning when Azad was driving the auto
rickshaw in Faridabad to deliver buffalo meat to a shop. He was accompanied by
Sonu, 14, an employee of the meat supplier.

They were stopped by six men, travelling in a car, who accused him of
transporting beef.

""I told them it wasn't beef and we could go to the police... but they didn't
listen,"" Azad later told NDTV. They took them away to Basadi village a short
distance away.

Surrounded by about 40 people, the cow vigilantes started raining blows on him
and kicked him. At some point, he called up home to tell them about the
situation. When his brother and other relatives reached, they were beaten up
too.

He was thrashed by the cow vigilantes for what he says seemed like eternity.

""When I could no longer take the pain... I fell unconscious,"" he said, showing
big black and blue patches on his back, arm and legs. Azad said he must have
been out for two hours or so.

When he came around, his attackers were still around. They weren't done with
him yet.

They wanted him to say ""Jai Hanuman"".

""I said I will not say. They said ""Say Jai Gau Mata"". I refused. They said we
are going to feed you pork (that is strictly prohibited in Islam) if you
don't. I told them, do what you want, I will not say,"" he said.

The police say they had initially filed a case against the victims under
Haryana's law against cow smuggling but said they were withdrawing it later
after confirming that it was buffalo meat, not cow meat.

The assault comes just a month after the Supreme Court delivered a strong
message on cow vigilantism and told states to crack down to curb the
increasing instances of cow vigilantism.

A few days back, RSS Mohan Bhagwat had stressed on a distinction between
""pious"" gau rakshaks, or cow protectors and criminals.

""People who are criminal and involved in violent activities should be bothered
about that (remarks from Supreme Court and PM Modi),"" Mr Bhagwat had said in
his speech on the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh's foundation day.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a corpus of Rs 10,000-crore to be given to top 20 Indian universities for their development, in order to ensure that the top ranking institutions are counted among the best in the world.

Addressing a function on the centenary celebrations of the Patna University in Bihar, PM Modi said measures like grant of central status were now “a thing of the past” and that his government has undertaken “a step forward” towards making 10 private and 10 government universities world class.

Replying to a request made by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in his speech earlier about giving Patna University the status of Central University, Modi said, “I would like to say something about a demand that was raised here and met with loud cheers by the young crowd attending this ceremony. Issues like grant of central status have become a thing of the past. We are taking a step forward. We will provide an assistance of Rs 10,000 crore to 10 private universities and an equal number of government ones for a period of five years. All these universities have to do is to demonstrate their potential to become world class,” he said.

The top 20 universities will be selected through a challenge which will be judged by a third party. Addressing the centenary celebrations, Modi said, “The universities will be a selected on the basis of a challenge in which they will be required to prove their mettle. The selection will be based on factors such as history, performance and its roadmap to reach global benchmarks. A third party professional agency will be involved in the selection process.”

The Prime Minister also called upon Patna University to seize the opportunity coming its way through the challenge and strive to be among the globally-ranked varsity based on the competition. Modi said, “Patna University should not stay behind (in the challenge).”

Urging both private and public institution to shift from the conventional way of teaching, Modi asked them to engage more alumni in the process and adopt innovative methods of learning.

Hailing his government’s decision of giving autonomy to Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Modi said, “It is for the first time that the IIMs are out of government control and have been professionally opened up. This is a big opportunity for them and they would make the best use.”

Modi, who visited the Patna University for the first time said, “In every state, the top levels of the civil services have people who have studied in Patna University. In Delhi, I interact with so many officials, many of whom belong to Bihar. I consider it my honour to visit Patna University and be among the students. I bow to this land of Bihar. This university has nurtured students who have contributed greatly to the nation.”

PM Modi praises CM Nitish Kumar

Modi also heaped praise on Nitish Kumar for his “commitment” to Bihar’s development, as the two leaders shared the dais for the first time after the JD(U) returned to the NDA fold following a split from the grand alliance. “Nitishji is committed to the development of Bihar and the central government has pledged to develop the country. Together the two will work to ensure that Bihar is counted among the prosperous states by 2022 when the country celebrates 75 years of independence,” the prime minister said.

He went on to add that Bihar has been blessed by Saraswati, the Goddess of learning. “But the time has come to propitiate Laxmi (Goddess of wealth and prosperity) as well and take the state to new heights of development,” he said. “The commitment of Nitish Kumar towards the progress of Bihar is commendable. The Centre attaches topmost importance to the development of eastern India,” Modi added.

This is the prime minister’s first full-fledged official tour to the state since Nitish Kumar led JD(U) formed an alliance with the BJP.

**Aadhaar-SIM linking fraud: How this man lost Rs 1.3 lakh from his salary account is a big lesson for all of us** 

 ______ 
This story gives a big lesson to all of us. (Photo from FB of Shashwat Gupta)

This story gives a big lesson to all of us. The Rs 1.3 lakh fraud allegedly happened in the name of linking Aadhaar with SIM. According to one Shashwat Gupta, he lost Rs 1.3 lakhs from his ICICI Bank salary account due to Aadhaar-SIM linking fraud. Shashwat Gupta has written a detailed post on his Facebook account sharing what really happened and how he lost Rs 1.3 lakh from his salary account; the money he had saved for using during the worst times of his life. Shashwat also questioned about the security of his ICICI account. He is demanding that ICICI Bank should refund every single penny which he lost in this incident.

Here is the FULL FB POST revealing what happened with Shashwat:-

“And in a blitz, my salary account was looted.

Hi guys! I just lost an amount of Rupees 1.3 lacs from my ICICI Bank salary account. A fraud, claiming to be from Airtel, gave me an ultimatum that Airtel would deactivate my SIM and block my number forever as I had not linked my Aadhar card to my SIM. He urged me to message my SIM card number to 121 (Official Airtel Service Number) and my SIM would be reactivated without any hassle. Little did I know that the fraudster would clone my SIM and loot all my hard earned money and also take away Investments (Fixed Deposits) that I had planned on using during the worst times of my life.

Is this all that was required to break my ICICI Bank Account? Is that how vulnerable technology have left us? I always thought that our accounts are well protected by layers of security. I was under the impression that a person would require my account details or debit card or some sensitive information that only I have, that I have been safeguarding every minute of my life, to break my account. But the truth is all that sensitive stuff is already floating around the criminal world waiting to be raided, as our beloved banks like ICICI Bank haven’t been able to keep what must only be ours, OURS!

It is unbelievable how easy it has become to steal from our accounts. All the fraudsters are doing is trying every trick they can think of to get that one tiny key that would break open a safe that seem to be safeguarded by hundred different locks.

The saddest part of this is, after the loot on day one, ICICI Bank was not able to protect the balance amount. Even after 18 hours of raising Service Request ( S/R 497438380 ) and repeated follow ups on customer care and branch, the Bank was not able to freeze my balance and as a result early next morning the fraudster was easily able to walk away with the remainder amount. Dear ICICI Bank, are your services supposed to end in crisis or are you supposed relieve the customers’ grievances and prevent further damage?

ICICI Bank needs to understand that a fraudster breaks much more than an account with his activities, he breaks a persons’ life.

I feel that the Bank has failed to protect my account effectively and are completely responsible for my losses. I hence demand ICICI Bank to refund every single penny I’ve lost in this incident.

I would also like to speak out to my friends here, guys please be careful and wary of these frauds. The people who we think are securing us, are actually the ones screwing us.”

ORIGINAL FB post:-



Shashwat has tagged these profiles in the post too. “ICICI Bank Arun Jaitley Ravi Shankar Prasad Digital India Piyush Goyal Reserve Bank of India Narendra Modi #fraud #ICICIBank Aditi Mallick The Times of India TIMES NOW Hindustan Times MumbaiMirror.com DNA India Airtel India My Malishka DailyO Mumbai Police”

Reacting to the incident ICICI bank said:-

Airtel has also responded to the incident:-

“Hi! Please be informed that as per the government initiative program it is advised not to share any kind of sensitive information to anyone over any kind of platforms as it may lead to fraudulent activities against the account. Further, request you to immediately report the query to the local authority. Thank you, Shivani R,” Airtel’s official FB profile wrote.

(The story is entirely based on the man’s FB post; FE doesn’t vouch for the authenticity of the post)

Highlights 1 Rahul Gandhi made the 'women in shorts' comment in Vadodara last week

2 Today, Swaraj challenged the idea that BJP is anti-women

3 She pointed to the number of women CMs, current women Cabinet ministers

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said it's unbecoming of a politician of Rahul Gandhi's stature to ask, as he did in Vadodara last Tuesday, whether anyone had seen women in shorts at a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) shaakha.

She said she wouldn't dignify such a remark with a response.

The point Rahul Gandhi was trying to make was the the RSS, the parent organisation of the BJP, was anti-women. ""Inka (BJP's) main sangathan RSS hai. Kitni mahilayan hain usme? Kabhi shaakha mein mahilaon ko dekha hai shorts mein? Maine to nahi dekha (Their main organisation is the RSS. How many women members does it have? Have you seen a woman in shorts at their shakhas? I haven't seen any)"", Rahul said at a public meeting.

And Swaraj had a message for rivals of the BJP who think it is anti-women.

The BJP, she said, has given India four women Chief Ministers. What's more, six ministers in the Narendra Modi cabinet are women.

And as she pointed out, she and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman are in the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS).

PATNA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday described as a ""blot"" the fact that Indian universities did not figure among the world's top 500, and said the government had decided to give autonomy and Rs 10,000 crore to India's top 10 public and 10 private universities over the next five years to make them world-class.Addressing the centenary celebrations of Patna University here in the presence of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar Modi said the institution should compete for a place among the top 20 universities in the country.He said the top 20 universities would be selected by an independent jury.""The government wants to free the top universities of government control. I invite Patna University to compete for that as it would be much greater than getting a central university status,"" the PM said.Nitish had earlier made a fervent appeal to Modi to grant central university status to PU and said everyone was looking towards him with a lot of hope. This was the first time Modi had shared the stage with Nitish Kumar after JD(U)'s return to the NDA fold.Modi also pointed out how many top civil servants working across the country were from the Patna University. ""I interact with 100-150 officials every day and a large number of them are from PU,"" he said.He also asked the universities to take up innovations on a priority basis.""Only those countries that make innovation a priority can develop,"" he said. Modi also appreciated Nitish Kumar's commitment towards the development of Bihar. ""When we celebrate 75 years of independence in 2022, Bihar should be among the developed states of the country.""Earlier, Modi laid the foundation of infrastructure projects worth Rs 3,769 crore, including sewage treatment plants for Patna, the four-laning of Aunta-Simariya section of NH-31 and the construction of a six-lane bridge over the Ganga at a function in the 'Taal' area of Mokama, about 90km from here.Speaking on the occasion, PM said road construction projects worth Rs 53,000 crore had either been completed or were underway in Bihar. Without naming RJD chief Lalu Prasad, the PM blamed him for poor condition of roads in Bihar. ""There are certain people who used to say roads are for those who have cars. No one has damaged the country more than such leaders,"" Modi said.

**HT Youth Survey: Narendra Modi continues to capture the imagination of the youth** 

 ______ 
The stardom Narendra Modi and Salman Khan enjoy refuses to fade away as they topped the charts as the living role model of the young and Bollywood’s biggest icon, respectively, the Hindustan Times Youth Survey 2017 has revealed. Modi was also chosen the biggest political icon.

Bollywood Icon

In a country where stars are almost worshipped like gods, it was no surprise when Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan took the top four spots in the survey with 18.3%, 15.3%, 13.3% and 13.2%, respectively. Clearly, people like to stick to conventional choices, even if all of them happen to be plus-50 actors.

Surprisingly, though , Kangana Ranaut and Vidya Balan — who featured in the list some years ago —now seem to have dropped out.

In what suggests the youth prefer the ‘star’ value over acting, Nawazuddin Siddiqui or Irrfan are other surprise omissions from choices. “Nawaz is someone who is an icon in his own rights. He has done some hatke films and I’m so impressed that despite not being the conventional good looking hero, he can give any leading actor a run for his money,” says 23-year-old Shagufta Ali, a master’s student.

Living role model for the young

Prime Minster Narendra Modi retains the highest-rated living role model position for the fifth year in a row, indicating a preference among the youth for influence, power, money and mass appeal. No longer looking for a short cut to make it big, youngsters are keen to explore success stories that are gripping. In comparison, former US president Barak Obama, who also featured in the survey results for three consecutive years, is no longer in the picture. Replacing him are Bill Gates (25.6%), Sundar Pichai (11.10%) and Malala Yousafzai (6.8%) who take up the three spots after Modi.

Some youngsters HT spoke to are divided on the choices. “Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is the living role model that I look up to. The way he is transforming society only through means of peace and his Art of Living teachings, is commendable. A role model is someone who is doing his bit to bring about a change in the society,” says Tripti Babbar, 22, a postgraduate student.

IDOLS, ROLE MODELS AND SEXIEST CELEBS In 2011, when Hindustan Times launched its annual Youth Survey, Narendra Modi was nowhere in the picture. In 2013, he was voted the top political icon and has not looked back since. Salman Khan, chosen India’s sexiest man from 2011 to 2014, is Bollywood’s top icon in 2017 In 2011, when Hindustan Times launched its annual Youth Survey, Narendra Modi was nowhere in the picture. In 2013, he was voted the top political icon and has not looked back since. Salman Khan, chosen India’s sexiest man from 2011 to 2014, is Bollywood’s top icon in 2017

Sexiest man alive

Sex appeal is a heady mix of appearance and popularity. While Salman Khan defines the term sexy for most of the youth — he has topped four surveys — the last two years have put Ranbir Kapoor as the sexiest man alive, going strong with 32.7% this year. Ranveer follows with 21.6% and Justin Bieber with 9.2%. Surprised by Hrithik Roshan, John Abraham, Ryan Gosling or Tom Cruise not making it to the list, Mrinal Madan, 24, an MA second year student, says, “I think Hrithik Roshan is hot and sexy. He’s got a great body, sex appeal plus he’s so good looking despite being a father to two sons.” Even Prabhas’s name is in the running. “I loved him in the film [Baahubali] and even if he is from South film industry, I find him to be sexier than many of our Bollywood heroes,” says Babbar.

Sexiest woman alive

Her Hollywood stint might have worked wonders for Deepika Padukone, who outpaced five-time favourite Katrina Kaif second year in a row as the sexiest woman alive. With nearly one-third of the youth voting for Padukone this year — same as last year — she successfully left behind international actors. “Deepika is just so hot. The way she acts on screen and carries herself is perfect,” says Ali. While Priyanka Chopra takes the second position at 22.9%, Alia Bhatt has hit the third spot with 22.1%.

Sports icon

Virat Kohli emerged as the top sports icon, dethroning MS Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar who held the spot for three years in a row each. 29.7% of the youth said Kohli was biggest icon, followed by Roger Federer (13.9%) and PV Sindhu (10.5%). “After Dhoni, it is only Kohli, who has that quality to lead a team and keep everyone united. He is young, full of ideas and someone, who knows how to balance things,” says Madan.

Political icon

Overlooking the flaws that Indian political system broadly suffers from, India’s youth unanimously chose prime minister Narendra Modi again as their political icon with a dominating percentage of 47.5%. Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi feature in the results with 8.9% and 8.7%. Initially hailed as a game changer, Delhi’s chief minister and the leader of Aam Aadmi Party Arvind Kejriwal settles for third slot with a tie with Mamata Banerjee at 7%.

**RBI refuses to share details on clean India mission logo on new currency notes** 

 ______ 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has refused to share details of a decision to put the logo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project 'clean India mission' on the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes, citing security concerns among other reasons.

Replying to an RTI query, the central bank also did not give a copy of the guidelines on printing of advertisement -- including promotion of central government-run initiatives -- on the notes.

""The information on form, material, design and security features of banknotes, other than available in public domain, is exempt from disclosure in terms of Section 8 (1) (a) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005,"" the RBI said in response to the RTI application filed by a correspondent.

The Section bars ""information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the state, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence"".

The central bank was asked to give a copy of the order, communication, letter or note sheet in which a decision regarding printing of Swachh Bharat or clean India mission's logo (spectacle frame) and message of 'Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur' (a step towards cleanliness) on Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes was taken.

To a question on providing the copy of guidelines or any other norms that prescribe standard operating procedures for printing of advertisement including the promotion on the currency notes, the RBI did not give a direct reply.

""Indian bank notes contain design elements such as guilloche, flora pattern, motifs and security features,"" the central bank said.

The RTI query was filed with the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) -- that deals with the policy formulation in respect of currency, coins and security documents, and planning, coordination issues related to printing and minting currencies and coins -- under the Finance Ministry.

The DEA had forwarded the application to the RBI for the response.

As per Section 25 of the RBI Act, 1934, the design, form and material of bank notes shall be such as may be approved by the central government after consideration of the recommendations made by central board of the Reserve Bank of India.

Modi had on October 2 2014 launched the clean India mission to make the country open defecation free and eradication of manual scavenging among other cleanliness related goals.

**Gurdaspur election results 2017: In a landslide, Congress wins by 1.93 lakh vote margin** 

 ______ 
Congress party’s Sunil Jakhar (left) defeated Bharatiya Janata Party’s Swaran Salaria by 1,93,219 votes in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll. Congress party’s Sunil Jakhar (left) defeated Bharatiya Janata Party’s Swaran Salaria by 1,93,219 votes in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll.

Having conceded the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha election in 2014 to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress on Sunday was once again able to wrest the seat by recording an impressive victory margin of 1.93 lakh votes.

The bye-election, necessitated after the demise of BJP MP Vinod Khanna, who had won by a 1.35 lakh vote margin, turned out to be a cakewalk for the Congress candidate and state unit chief, Sunil Kumar Jakhar. He polled 4,99,752 votes against the 3,06,553 votes cast for runner-up and BJP candidate Sawarn Singh Salaria. AAP candidate Suresh Khajuria couldn’t save his security deposit after receiving just 23,579 votes.

The previous record for the highest margin of victory in Gurdaspur was held by former Congress MP Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder, who had won with a margin of 1.51 lakh votes in 1980. Sunday’s landslide win for the Congress holds importance ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, with the party hailing it as the “people’s mandate” against the BJP.

“I had said it from the very first day that this election will be a mandate on the policies of union government led by Modi. People have vent their anger against demonetisation and GST by making me an MP with a huge margin of votes. I had asked people to vote for me and against BJP’s economic and communal agenda. People have responded to my call and it has sent a clear message to union government on the behalf of whole country that people are fed up from its policies and it is time for change,” Jakhar said.

“This election is also victory of development agenda of Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh led state government. The wavier of farmers loan and steps to revive economy of Punjab. People have honoured Congress government for work done in last six months in state,” he added.

After tasting a humiliating defeat in Gurdaspur in 2014, the Congress did not leave any stone unturned to win the bye-election. Former PPCC president Partap Singh Bajwa had lost in all of the nine Assembly segments in 2014, including his home turf Qadian, which is represented by his MLA wife Charanjit Kaur Bajwa.

Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency comprises of nine assembly constituencies — Gurdaspur, Dinanagar, Qadian, Dera Baba Nanak, Sujanpur, Fatehgarh Churian, Bhoa, Batala and Pathankot.

Jakhar, however, has won from all the nine segments even though the Congress had lost from Sujanpur and Batala in the recent assembly elections. The seat was considered a Congress pocket borough before BJP handpicked a celebrity in Khanna in 1998. Vinod Khanna had won from the segment in 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2014.

A united face put up by the party, with Bajwa, who had earlier stayed away from the poll campaign, working in favour of Jakhar, and several other factors worked for the party. Former Akali minister Sucha Singh Langah’s sleazy video and the registration of a rape case against him is believed to have contributed to the Congress’ victory. Jakhar recorded a margin of 21,000 votes from Bajwa’s Qadian, silencing the former PCC chief’s detractors who claimed that he was not doing enough to ensure the party’s victory.

Meanwhile, BJP candidate Salaria claimed the Congress rigged the election.

“I congratulate Sunil Jakhar on his victory. At the same time, everyone knows that Congress has won this election by rigging. Government machinery was on misused to influence voters. All the officials were given targets. There was clear warning for the people that they would be implicated in false police cases if they votes for BJP,” he said.

While AAP candidate Khajuria repeated his party’s stand on EVMs. “Congress has done everything to win this election. They have tempered with EVM machines. They have uses police to keep voters at home,” he said.

Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu attempted to shift the blame on Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal and his brother-in-law former cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majithia for BJP’s defeat.

“It is defeat of jija-sala. People have shown them their place. Now both have become burden on BJP. Such a huge defeat is evidence of the same. The victory of Congress is such a slap in the face of jija-sala that its voice will be heard in Delhi,” said Sidhu.

Election result proof of Congress revival in national politics: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has hailed the Congress victory in Gurdaspur, and termed it as a complete rejection of the anti-people policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).

“The massive win for Congress candidate Sunil Jakhar shows the people’s complete denunciation of the corrupt and immoral BJP and SAD,” said Captain Amarinder, adding that it also underlined the political annihilation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the state.

Captain Amarinder thanked the voters of Gurdaspur for their overwhelming love and support from all parts of Gurdaspur, especially the rural areas.

“The over 1.93 lakh margin of victory has not only more than compensated for the 1.36 lakh vote defeat of Congress candidate Pratap Singh Bajwa against BJP’s Vinod Khanna in 2014 but has surpassed even the 1.51 lakh lead by which Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder (Congress) had won in 1980,” Said Captain.

Jakhar’s victory comes as a strong rebuttal to the persistent Akali efforts and campaign of the past six months to undermine the work being done by his government in the state, he added.

For AAP, this election marks the end of its political ambitions in Punjab, Captain Amarinder said, pointing out that the dissolution of the Pathankot and Gurdaspur units of AAP a day before the declaration of the results showed that the party had conceded defeat and had accepted that it had completely failed to connect with the people of the state.

Captain Amarinder said the people wanted development, which only the Congress could give them. The people were completely aware of the welfare initiatives taken by the Congress government since taking over the state’s reins in March this year, he said, adding that they had full faith in the government’s commitment to their progress.

Captain Amarinder said the Gurdaspur result once again showed that the Congress was on the path of revival across the country. “The party’s recent victory in several university students’ union elections and its resounding win in the Maharashtra civic polls just two days ago were clear indicators that the party’s fortunes were on the upswing and the result of the Gurdaspur bypoll further strengthened its prospects for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” he added.

**Disturbed Areas Act imposed in parts of Surat, Vadodara** 

 ______ 
The Gujarat government on Saturday imposed the Disturbed Areas Act in Surat city covering the Central zone of Surat Municipal Corporation and in several residential colonies within the Bapod police station limits of Vadodara.

With the imposition of the Act, the owners of land and other immovable properties in these areas will have to seek permission from the district collector before selling their assets. An official release stated that the Act seeks to keep a tab on illegal transfer of properties in the communally sensitive areas, officially described as disturbed areas.

The notification has come two months after BJP MLA Sangeeta Patil submitted a memorandum to the district collector for the implementation of the Ashant Dhara Act (Disturbed Areas Act) in 25 residential societies of the Limbayat area. The MLA demanded the imposition of the Act to “prevent Muslims from acquiring residential properties of Hindus”.

The Congress leaders had however opposed this. BJP MLA from Surat West Purnesh Modi had sent a similar proposal. Purnesh said, “I am happy that the state government accepted my proposal to implement the Ashant Dhara Act. It is for the betterment of the people.”

Responding to the notification, Patil said, “Three days ago, I received a copy from state government in which they said that my proposal of implementation of Ashant Dhara Act in 25 residential societies in Limbayat area was in pipeline and it will soon be done. I will now submit another proposal for covering remaining residential societies in same area under the Ashant Dhara Act.”

**'Vikas Gone Crazy' Won't Hurt BJP, We Know Social Media: Union Minister** 

 ______ 
Jitendra Singh is assigned to manage the BJP's bid for Gujarat.

**New Delhi: **

As Rahul Gandhi prepares to take on the top job in his party, union minister
Jitendra Singh told NDTV the promotion is unlikely to reverse the Congress'
losing streak. ""Don't you think 50 is too old to be coming of age?"" Mr Singh,
who is a minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told NDTV.

Mr Singh is off by three years - Mr Gandhi turned 47 in June.

He is expected to replace his mother, Sonia Gandhi, as Congress chief by the
end of the month

. This week, he has been campaigning in Gujarat, the home state of Prime
Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah.

The BJP has ruled Gujarat uninterrupted for nearly two decades. In an attempt
to break that pattern, Mr Gandhi has in his speeches asked people to hold the
PM accountable for an economic slowdown and for

a paucity of jobs for the country's young workforce

. His party is also heavily citing a social media campaign that declares ""

_Vikas Gando Thayo Che_

"" (development gone crazy), which mocks the BJP's famous and stated focus on
progress and development, to glaze its own claims against the PM.

Mr Singh, who is assigned to manage the BJP's bid for Gujarat, said the
wildfire spread of the slogan hasn't disturbed his party. ""It's okay,"" he told
NDTV today. ""The Congress is trying to catch up. It was the BJP which always
used new trends in elections. In fact, in the early days it was a BJP man, the
founder of Jain TV, who would make and use videos in elections.""

PM Modi visited his hometown Vaadnagar for the first time after he took over
as the Prime Minister

PM Modi has begun campaigning for his party in his home state and visited it
last week.

The BJP has 121 of 182 seats; the BJP President has declared Mission 150,
urging party workers to ensure that they ""prove their gratitude to the Prime
Minister"" by increasing their existing count. Though the BJP has not named its
presumptive Chief Minister, it has said the election will be run by incumbent
Vijay Rupani. The Congress, which has 57 seats, has not named its Chief
Ministerial candidate. Of the 57, 14 legislators have defected or quit
recently.

In what was seen as a big concession to Gujarat ahead of the election, the new
national Goods and Services Tax or GST was reduced on items important to the
state's traders - the savoury khakra snack and man-made yarn, for example. The
changes, Mr Singh said, do not corroborate the allegation that the GST was
hurriedly introduced, causing chaos among small traders. ""The fact that we've
changed our GST schemes, doesn't mean that they were wrong to begin with. It
just means that we are a government which listens to feedback,"" the minister
said.

The BJP's problems in Gujarat include a new hostility from the powerful Patel
or Patidar community, which backed the party for years, but now says it has
been left out of affirmative action schemes which has weakened its standing
and the prospects of its youth. HardIk Patel, the community's young leader,
has mobilised a movement against the BJP and is seen as a likely helping hand
for the Congress.

This desperate move has also flopped,"" he claimed.Azad said if Prime Minister Modi was such a ""vote catcher then why was Adityanath being pushed in the campaign in the Prime Minister's home state.""He said the recent assault on a Muslim youth carrying buffalo meat by alleged cow vigilantes in Faridabad indicated that law enforcement in the country has gone out of the government's hand.""Such incidents are continuing despite claims of the PM,"" he said.Addressing the function, Congress' state unit president Raj Babbar said that, ""it was ironical that UP chief minister Yogi Adaityanath was campaigning on the plank of providing better law and order in Kerala and Gujarat states while law and order in his own state is collapsing"".

**Led by Chinese, nearly 600 companies line up $85 billion investments in India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Sany Heavy Industry heads up a list of close to 600 companies planning to invest a total of about $85 billion in India in projects that will create an estimated 700,000 jobs in the country in next five years. Invest India , the government's foreign investment promotion agency, is planning to actively promote the country as an investment destination and has drawn up a list of 200 companies not present in India that it wants to target.""We want to achieve a $100 billion target of foreign investment in the next two years — both greenfield and brownfield,"" said Invest India managing director Deepak Bagla. India recorded its highest FDI (foreign direct investment) in FY17 at $43 billion, up 9 per cent over the previous year.One of the world's leading engineering machinery manufacturers, China's Sany Heavy Industry plans an investment of $9.8 billion. Amazon , along with several other Chinese companies — Pacific Construction, China Fortune Land Development and Dalian Wanda — are each planning investments of more than $5 billion during this period.Of the total indicated investment, $7.43 billion has already materialised and 100,000 jobs have been created, according to Invest India.Rolls-Royce plans to invest $3.7 billion and Australia's Perdaman Industries $3 billion.Invest India is handholding the investors through the process, starting with identifying opportunities to scouting for locations and guiding them on policy.Most of the investment proposals are from China at 42 per cent , followed by the US at 24 per cent and the UK at 11 per cent .Energy and waste management have received the highest investment interest followed by construction and ecommerce.The Invest India team recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to update him on the status of the big foreign investments coming into India. ""In essence we are the voice of investor in the system and solely dedicated to FDI,"" said Bagla.""The idea is, as PM Modi said, to transform red tape into a red carpet for investors."" Commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu has said there is a need for a paradigm shift in the government's approach to increase investments and it will reach out proactively to prospective investors.The agency said it has received more than 100,000 investor queries from 114 countries in the past two years. Invest India says it can help companies meet the most stringent criteria.A top Fortune 500 company stipulated 136 parameters while scouting for land to set up its facility in India recently.""We researched for over 70 days, gathered data across the country and came up with options in four states meeting each of their criteria for them to choose from,"" Bagla said.

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Indian economy is on a solid growth track in the medium and long term due to the structural reforms undertaken by the government, and the current slowdown due to implementation of the goods &amp; services tax ( GST ) and demonetisation is short term, International Monetary Fund IMF ) chief Christine Lagarde has said.The IMF on Tuesday lowered India's growth forecast for 2017-18 to 6.7% from its earlier estimate of 7.2%, citing lingering impact of demonetisation and transition cost to GST. But, India is expected to regain the fastest growing major economy tag next year when it is forecast to grow 7.4% (slower than earlier estimate of 7.7%), higher than China's 6.5%. IMF also expects the Indian economy to grow 8% in the medium term on the back of reforms undertaken so far.""We have slightly downgraded India. However, we believe that India is on a growth track for the medium and long term, that is much more solid as a result of the structural reforms that have been conducted in India in the last couple of years,"" Lagarde told a news conference in Washington, DC.""Now, of course the demonetisation that took place, of course collapsing 40 different taxes into one single GST is a monumental effort and given the implementation associated with, it is hardly surprising that there is a little bit of a short-term slowdown as a result but for the medium term we see a very solid track ahead of the Indian economy,"" she said.Lagarde was confident that jobs would be created in India on the back of reforms unveiled by the government. The Narendra Modi-led government has faced criticism after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7% in the June quarter, prompting the PM to slam critics for spreading what he called was ""pessimism"".""The (fiscal) deficit has been reduced, inflation is down significantly and the structural reforms will deliver jobs the Indian population, particularly the young Indian people, expect in the future,"" the IMF chief said indicating a strong support for the government's reforms agenda.

**GST risks losing its idea of oneness** 

 ______ 
The onus is on the GST Council to fix the glitches in the tax reform as it threatens the fundamental principle of GST: ‘One Nation, One Tax’. Photo: AP

Last week finance minister Arun Jaitley confirmed what one so far has heard sotto voce: that the goods and services tax (GST) Council is considering bringing real estate under the purview of the new indirect tax regime.

As a destination architecture the move is very desirable and hence welcome; ideally even petroleum products should be brought under GST. But the more immediate concern is that in the nearly four months since GST was rolled out on 1 July—it has just crossed 100 days—some threats to its architecture are emerging. And tragically some of the efforts to tinker with the existing GST architecture are being masked as so-called relief measures—partly a knee-jerk response to the ongoing rhetorical political debate on the economy and the efficacy of GST.

Most worryingly they are challenging the core of the GST: ‘One Nation, One Tax’. And unless the GST Council addresses this, any such expansion of the scope of GST to bring in more sectors will be risking this marque piece of tax reform.

For one, it is apparent that the back-end of the GST manned by the GST Network (GSTN) is not operating optimally; a panel headed by Bihar’s finance minister Sushil Modi is overseeing the fix, which insiders reveal is likely to be extensive.

Second, the Council in its wisdom has decided to suspend the nation-wide rollout of the e-way bill system till 1 April next year. The e-way bill, an electronic receipt that businesses and traders have to secure to transport goods beyond 10km, was to be operational by 1 October. This was supposed to replace the check-posts (notorious for delaying consignments and exchange of bribes) and allow for seamless movements of goods, consistent with the notion of one nation and creating competitive efficiency.

According to insiders there is strong pressure from some quarters within the GST Council to further delay the e-way bill. Most states had formally withdrawn the check-posts, but with the ensuing confusion there is word that they are making a slow comeback. This would be disastrous and strike at the roots of the principle of a unified market.

Similarly the GST Council has put on hold for six months the reverse charge mechanism (RCM) under which large entities were required to pay taxes on purchase from unregistered small and medium enterprises (SME) operating in the informal economy. Recognizing that this SME space doesn’t have the wherewithal to comply with the GST rigour, the new tax regime had placed this liability on the large enterprises buying from them—in return they got tax credit for this sum.

The logic, very sound, was to bring the unregistered SMEs into the tax base (read formalizing the informal economy) without burdening them. Now the fear is that lobbying may further delay RCM; if indeed this does happen once again the GST architecture designed to widen the tax base may be compromised.

A similar fear surrounds active lobbying to tinker with the existing ‘composition scheme’ for taxpayers with up to Rs75 lakh annual sales. Under the scheme they were to be charged a levy instead of GST and hence not eligible for input tax credit and selling inter-state.

At the last meeting of the GST Council it was decided to raise the threshold to Rs1 crore and now lobbying is on to allow these taxpayers to also claim input tax credit and sell inter-state. If it goes through, insiders fear, not only will it open up an opportunity for misuse as taxpayers will prefer paying a levy instead of GST, but it will also encourage cash transactions and hurt the original plan of extending the tax base to unregistered units—especially since RCM is on hold.

To conclude then, it is apparent that the GST experiment has done well in the first 100 days. Yes, there are some glitches which need to be fixed. But there is no need to panic, because although it opens the doors for opportunists to restore the status quo made up of large cash-based trade transactions outside the purview of the indirect tax system.

More importantly, it threatens the fundamental principle of GST: ‘One Nation, One Tax’. The onus is on the GST Council, India’s first federal institution.

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has refused to share details of a decision to put the logo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project ‘clean India mission’ on the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 currency notes, citing security concerns among other reasons.

Replying to an RTI query, the central bank also did not give a copy of the guidelines on printing of advertisement—including promotion of central government-run initiatives—on the notes. “The information on form, material, design and security features of bank notes, other than available in public domain, is exempt from disclosure in terms of Section 8 (1) (a) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005,” the RBI said in response to the RTI application filed by a PTI correspondent.The Section bars “information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the state, relation with foreign state or lead to incitement of an offence”.

The central bank was asked to give a copy of the order, communication, letter or note sheet in which a decision regarding printing of Swachh Bharat or clean India mission’s logo (spectacle frame) and message of ‘Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur’ (a step towards cleanliness) on Rs500 and Rs2,000 currency notes was taken.

To a question on providing the copy of guidelines or any other norms that prescribe standard operating procedures for printing of advertisement including the promotion on the currency notes, the RBI did not give a direct reply. “Indian bank notes contain design elements such as guilloche, flora pattern, motifs and security features,” the central bank said.

The RTI query was filed with the department of economic affairs (DEA)—that deals with the policy formulation in respect of currency, coins and security documents, and planning, coordination issues related to printing and minting currencies and coins—under the finance ministry.

The DEA had forwarded the application to the RBI for the response. As per Section 25 of the RBI Act, 1934, the design, form and material of bank notes shall be such as may be approved by the central government after consideration of the recommendations made by central board of the Reserve Bank of India.

Modi had on 2 October 2014 launched the clean India mission to make the country open defecation free and eradication of manual scavenging among other cleanliness related goals. PTI

**Punjab continues to reject BJP's 'Congress-mukt Bharat' rant** 

 ______ 
CHANDIGARH: If Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah's 'Congress-mukt Bharat' (Congress-free India) campaign has hit a wall in any state, it is definitely Punjab The unprecedented victory of the Congress, by over 1.93 lakh votes, over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat by-election, the result of which was declared on Sunday, has certainly put another spanner in the BJP bandwagon's wheel.The Congress, which achieved an emphatic win in the February Punjab assembly elections and returned to power after a gap of 10 years, has again shown -- through its big win in Gurdaspur -- that it can counter the BJP's political offensive.After the assembly and now Gurdaspur loss, the BJP might try to get away by saying that it is a smaller player in an alliance with the dominant Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab but it will not cut much ice.The BJP had won the Gurdaspur seat in 2014 general election by a big margin of over 1.36 lakh votes. Veteran actor Vinod Khanna , who remained the MP from this seat four times, won the last election.The by-election, necessitated by Khanna's death in April due to cancer, was not only a test for the Modi government, which has been in office for over three years, but also the nearly seven-month-old Congress government in Punjab led by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.Amarinder Singh, who bet on Punjab Congress President Sunil Jakhar -- a rank outsider -- in Gurdaspur, much to the annoyance of Congress leader from Gurdaspur district and Rajya Sabha MP Pratap Singh Bajwa, saw that the Congress candidate sailed through comfortably in the bypoll.Jakhar, a soft-spoken and suave politician who is son of former Lok Sabha Speaker Balram Jakhar, had to rely heavily on Congress legislators, leadership and workers in Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts to pull off the win.The BJP, on the other hand, chose Mumbai-based millionaire businessman Swarn Salaria as its candidate, ignoring the claim of Khanna's widow Kavita Khanna, who worked in the constituency during Khanna's absence.Salaria, who has a controversial past, could not woo the voters even in the name of Prime Minister Modi or with his claim to being a ""local"" in Gurdaspur.The Aam Aadmi Party , the main opposition party in the Punjab assembly, ended up with much embarrassment as its candidate Major General S.K. Khajuria (retd) lost his security deposit.The BJP will soon have to figure out whether it would want to continue playing second fiddle to the Akalis in Punjab or strengthen its own base. Its present state leadership certainly needs an overhaul -- given the fact that none of the leaders have a statewide appeal.

**'Jumlon ki baarish': Rahul Gandhi on today's massive BJP event in poll-bound Gujarat** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets set today to address a mammoth BJP gathering in poll-bound Gujarat Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi turned to sarcasm and said, ""it's going to rain pre-poll (tall) promises galore"".Rahul's comment was a reference to Congress and other Opposition allegations that poll dates for Gujarat weren't announced as per schedule last week to give an opportunity to the BJP to ""rain sops"" on the people of the state ahead of Assembly elections.Today, Modi and BJP president Amit Shah will address over seven lakh BJP workers at the conclusion of party's ongoing Gujarat Gaurav Yatra, it's poll campaign program.Rahul said he expects the BJP and Modi will announce sops and ambitious programmes at today's event.""Today's weather report: It's going to rain pre-poll (tall) promises galore"", tweeted the Congress vice president today, referring to the BJP's massive meeting today.Last week, the Congress alleged that the Election Commission's (EC) move to delay announcing the dates for the Assembly election in Gujarat smacked of ""direct interference"" by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.Last Thursday, the EC announced that elections in Himachal Pradesh will be held November 9, while for Gujarat, all it said is that elections will be held some time before December 18.The Congress accused the BJP of pressuring the EC to tilt the ""playing field"" in Gujarat in its favour.""It is a fundamental assault on a level playing field. The BJP is trying to convert Election Commission to Election Ommission,"" said Congress spokesperson AM Singhvi on Friday, a day after the EC's announcement.However, chief election commissioner (CEC) AK Joti said the delay in announcing the Gujarat dates was to ensure the state did not have to endure a long period under the pre-poll model code of conduct. Joti said there is ""no justification"" to have a prolonged period of imposition of model code of conduct as it could hamper development work.CEC Joti also added that the Gujarat government had told the Commission that it needed time to complete relief work before the model code is enforced.

**GST panel to consult MSMEs in October end to further ease tax rigour** 

 ______ 
A tax relaxation is under consideration for inter-state sale of goods without registration if turnover is below Rs20 lakh. Photo: PTI

New Delhi: A five-member ministerial panel set up by the federal indirect tax body, the goods and services tax (GST) Council, will meet representatives of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) at its second meeting on 29 October to seek views on how to make compliance in the GST regime easier for them.

The panel tasked with suggesting ways of making the quarterly tax payment scheme for small businesses more attractive wants to consult SMEs to make its recommendations as broad based as possible before they are placed before the Council to take a decision at its meeting on 9 November.

The GST Council had at its last meeting on 6 October allowed firms with up to Rs1 crore annual sales to sign up for the quarterly payment scheme, up from the earlier Rs75 lakh and exempted inter-state service providers with sales up to Rs20 lakh from the need for GST registration. A similar relaxation is under consideration for inter-state sale of goods without registration if turnover is below Rs20 lakh.

“The issues small traders were facing in the GST regime have been taken care of by the relaxations already announced at the last Council meeting. A lot of MSMEs with sales up to Rs1.5 crore, who, in the earlier regime had enjoyed excise duty exemption, have come under GST because of the Rs20 lakh sales threshold for GST registration. We want to consult small manufacturers on the issues they face in the new tax regime,” a person privy to the discussions in the panel said, on the condition of anonymity. The panel, which also looks into the taxation of restaurants, met on Sunday.

The Council is taking extra care to resolve all the difficulties faced by the MSME sector because of its significant contribution to the economy and employment. According to data published by the ministry of MSMEs in 2011, the sector accounts for 33% of India’s manufacturing output and 36 million such enterprises employed more than 80 million people. Their contribution to the economy is believed to have gone up since.

The ministerial panel members are Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, Jammu and Kashmir finance minister Haseeb Drabu, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Chhattisgarh commercial taxes minister Amar Agrawal.

What statistics don’t tell Ahmednagar constable suspended for criticising PM Modi: Police Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a mega rally in Gujarat’s capital Gandhinagar on Monday. Modi’s home state is slated to go to polls around the end of this year. The schedule for polls, however, have not been announced yet.

On Sunday, PM Modi said in a series of tweets: “I bow to the people of Gujarat for blessing BJP for decades. We will always fulfil the dreams of every Gujarati with full strength &amp; vigour.” The prime minister said that the event named Gujarat Gaurav Mahasammelan comes after a culmination of two Gujarat Gaurav Yatras.

The event being held at Bhat village near Gandhinagar is likely to see attendees like Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Amit Shah and others.

Slug-fest over poll dates has started as Congress blamed the BJP for pressuring the Election Commission into delaying the announcement of schedule. The EC has, however, denied the claim.

PM Modi’s visits to Gujarat have been more frequent in the run up to the elections. On a two-day visit last week, he visited and inaugurated several projects in Gandhinagar, Bharat, Rajkot and his hometown Vadnagar. Mid last month he visited the state along with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to lay the foundation stone of the bullet train project.

Meanwhile, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has launched the party’s election campaign in the state holding rallies and road shows. The BJP has ruled Gujarat since March 1995 barring a brief period between September 1996 to March 1998 which saw President’s rule and then a Rashtriya Janata Party government.

**Kerala shutdown by Congress-led UDF affects normal life** 

 ______ 
A state-wide dawn-to-dusk shutdown on Monday called by the Congress-led UDF in Kerala against the “anti-people policies” by the state and Centre, affected normal life.

Shops remained closed and private buses did not operate. Although the state-owned public transport operated under police security and private vehicles were also seen plying, business establishments were closed in major towns and cities.

The United Democratic Front (UDF) shutdown was called to protest the “anti-people policies” of the Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala and the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.

The shutdown was also against the steep price hike of petroleum products and cooking gas.

UDF chairman and Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the strike will be held in a peaceful manner.

In the first three hours of the shutdown, no major trouble was reported. Some protesters at a few places tried to create problem and were taken into custody.

In the state capital, buses operating towards Tamil Nadu were found plying without any glitch. Autorickshaws were also seen on the roads.

The buses of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) units were seen operating under security cover.

Although the IT hubs in Kochi and here was functioning, the markets wore a deserted look.

Attendances in government offices, like in previous shutdowns, were expected to have many seats vacant, as most from the city outskirts would find it difficult to reach.

The police in major cities were providing transport facilities especially to patients who arrive at the railway and bus stations to the hospitals.

The Kerala government has warned that tough actions would be taken against trouble makers.

**Mughal ‘blot’ in our history is being changed: BJP’s Sangeet Som on Taj Mahal not in UP govt tourism booklet** 

 ______ 
BJP MLA Sangeet Som (File photo)

Days after the Uttar Pradesh government dropped the Taj Mahal from the state tourism department’s booklet, BJP MLA Sangeet Som justified the move, saying ‘the builder of the monument had worked to eliminate Hindus from Uttar Pradesh and India.’

In a video released by news agency ANI, Som said, “Many people were sad when the Taj Mahal was removed from the tourism booklet. What history are we talking about? The history that the builder of the Taj had imprisoned his father? The history that the builder of the Taj had worked to eliminate Hindus from Uttar Pradesh and India? If such people are still mentioned in history then it is unfortunate.”

During a visit to Meerut, Som said described Mughal emperors Babur, Akbar and Aurangzeb as “traitors” and said their names would be removed from pages of history.

Som, the MLA who was accused of posting a video on Facebook which triggered communal violence in Muzaffarnagar that claimed 62 lives, has landed into controversies for making inflammatory speeches in the past. The Special Investigation Team probing the riots case, however, had given him a clean chit in the case.

The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO world heritage site, was not added to the tourism booklet released recently by the government leading to a controversy. The opposition Congress had accused the Yogi government of playing with history. The booklet released by the state Tourism Minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi features other heritage sites including Adityanath’s Gorakhdham temple and temples of Mathura and Ayodhya as well.

In the ANI video, Som said the current government at the state and Centre are changing the ‘blots of history.’ “The government of India and the government of Uttar Pradesh are working to bring back that history on the correct path, that history is being brought back to books.” He said that history is changing. “In the last many years, the work that had gone on to misrepresent history, is now being corrected,” the BJP leader said.

“From Lord Ram to Krishnji to Maharana Pratap to Shivaji’s history, (all) are being brought back to history books. That blot, be it Akbar, Aurangzeb or Babur, their history is being expunged by the government.”

Reacting to Som’s remarks, MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi asked whether the prime minister would stop hoisting the Tri-Colour at Red Fort as it was built by “traitors”.

“‘Traitors’ also build Red Fort will MODI stop hoisting Tiranga ?Can MODI &amp; YOGI tell domestic &amp; foreign tourist not to visit TAJ MAHAL?,” he tweeted.

“Even Hyderabad House in delhi was built by ‘Traitor’ will MODI stop hosting Foreign Dignitaries??,” he added.

He added that Mughal emperors Babur, Akbar and Aurangzeb were ""traitors"".The AIMIM's Owaisi wasn't the only person critical of Som's comments. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the National Conference (NC) also slammed Som.NC leader Omar Abdullah wondered if people looked forward to Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the nation on Independence Day from New Delhi's Nehru Stadium instead of from the ramparts of the Red Fort.An SP spokeswoman said the Taj must not be dragged into any controversies.""Don't create controversy around Taj Mahal. It brings lot of revenue,"" said the SP's Juhi Singh, about the BJP MLA's comment.The BJP's Som, though, indicated he doesn't believe the Taj Mahal should be historical site.Touching on the recent dropping of the monument from a State list of Uttar Pradesh's historical sites, Som wondered why it should be considered part of Indian culture and history.""Many were sad when the Taj Mahal was removed from the list of historical places. What kind of history? What place's history? Whose history? The history that the man who built the Taj Mahal imprisoned his father?

**GST Decision 'Not Taken By PM Modi Alone,' Says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi is in Gujarat to campaign for the BJP ahead of state polls.

**Gandhinagar: **

Defending the new national sales tax or GST, Prime Minister Narendra Modi
today said that “the decision to implement the reform was not of Prime
Minister Modi alone.” He said there were nearly 30 parties that were consulted
and involved with the new tax, of whom he singled out one. “The Congress is an
equal partner in GST decisions. They should not spread lies on GST,” the Prime
Minister said at a rally in Gujarat, his home state which he governed for over
a decade.

The GST has been tagged, along with the PM’s shock decision to ban high-
denomination notes a year ago, as a significant contributing factor to the
economic slowdown. Top union ministers have said that the slowdown, based on
the last quarter which registered a three-year-low of 5.7 per cent growth, is
being exaggerated. The PM himself in a lengthy defence of his economic record
said that “a handful of pessimists” are playing fast and loose with facts to
misrepresent a blip in the economy.

The government and the PM’s party have said that short-term pain points caused
by these structural reforms will be more than compensated for because GST and
demonetization will curb black or untaxed money and steadily expand the base
of taxpayers.

The GST, which replaced a jumble of tariffs and levies imposed by the centre
and states, was conceived of by the previous Congress-led government. The
Congress and other opposition parties have attacked Mr Modi’s administration
for a rush job in introducing the GST on July 1. Problems included on online
filing system that has been on the fritz and complicated tax slabs.

Earlier this month, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley met with his counterparts
from states – together, they comprise the GST Council -and revised rates on a
range of items. Among them, those that are crucial to traders in Gujarat: the
khakra snack, for example, and man-made textile yarn. Critics pointed out
these concessions were intended to ensure the BJP was not penalised by small
and medium sized businesses in Gujarat, which must vote before December 18.

“We took feedback and we made changes,” Mr Modi said to

a huge rally in Gandhinagar

, the capital of Gujarat. “All parties and states were involved” in deciding
the main features of the GST, he said.

**9 Indian Ambitious Projects That Did Us No Good** 

 ______ 
A lot of people are feeling dejected about where this country is headed, and to be frank, they ought to. Indians have vested their faith, life, and money in this country, only to see their hopes go up in flames.

In the past two decades or so, it is safe to say that India has undergone a drastic change, but most Indians have been perpetually disappointed, be it with scams of the Congress and its allies or the inability to speak against today’s government, we live with a sword hanging over our heads.

With no power and no say in what happens to us, all we seemed to get was a waste of our taxes, complex policies and were done at the cost of what would have benefited us more. Here’s a brief list of things that failed India:

1. Bullet train

Express

There are no words to describe the wastefulness of this project. Being built at a cost of ₹100,000 crore, an IIM Ahmedabad study showed that 1,00,000 passengers would have to travel each day at a cost &gt; Rs 4,000 for the project to break even. A flight ticket costs around the same and can go down to Rs 2,500.

Around the time, this was announced 10 trains derailed over 15 days all over the country. Perhaps it’s time to focus on lesser mishaps, running on schedule, improved security, better connectivity, end-to-end delivery, food quality, and how the poorest among us can travel. Else, it’s like saying ‘if they can’t afford bread, let them eat cake’.

2. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial, Mumbai

designassociates

At a time where more than a hundred people died in India in the aftermath of demonetisation, the Maharashtra government launched a Rs 3,600 crore-grand memorial for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj off the Mumbai city coast.

The 210-meter statue is being built as the tallest statue in the world, which is exactly what we need when year after year people suffer from floods amidst crumbling infrastructure, right? Because bragging rights against China, which currently has the world’s tallest statue is what will lift us all into being a developed country.

3. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue

downtoearth

Spread across 20,000 square meters of the project area and surrounded by an artificial lake spread across 12 km. The 182-metre tall statute is being built at a cost of Rs 2,989 crore is a waste of money, effort, manpower, space and resources.

When most of the country is starving, have no electricity, potable water, toilets, or even basic safety, spending millions on a status symbol. The irony is that Sardar Patel himself famously said, “My only desire is that India should be a good producer and no one should be hungry, shedding tears for food in the country.” It’s a shame we can’t honour his wishes.

4. National mission for clean Ganga

thethirdpole

Don’t get us wrong. Nothing would make us happier than seeing India’s most sacred river restored to its pristine glory. The first Ganga plan was launched by Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India on 14 January 1986. Thirty years later, and after several hundred crores spent, the situation is as bad as ever.

In fact, our most sacred river is more toxic than any other river in the country today. Did you know that there was an entire Commission dedicated to cleaning the Ganga? The only thing that has changed ever since Modi came is the ministry, committee and budgets. “Not a single drop of the Ganga has been cleaned so far,” the green tribunal noted at a hearing in January.

5. Demonetisation

thehansindia

Where were you when the Prime Minister announced demonetisation on 8 November, 2016? What ensued next was a blur as people scrambled to find out what would happen to their money, even that, which was entirely white.

Despite the bomb, India rose like a phoenix from the blaze. It’s been nearly a year, and the government is yet to tell us how exactly that move was beneficial. Where is the black money that was to be unearthed? Who were the people who were brought to task for hoodwinking the system? Have any of you got your Rs 15 lakh?

6. Aadhaar linking

aadhaarcard

Your PAN card will soon become invalid if it is not linked with Aadhaar. You won’t be able to book travel tickets if you don’t have Aadhaar. Aadhaar is mandatory. Aadhaar needs to be linked with all your bank accounts –these messages have been doing the rounds with not one justification why.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court had clarified that linking the Aadhaar Card is not mandatory, and yet the government still seems to insist that it is.

7. Cattle protection

chiralaharekrishnas

We know that this a tricky situation. While Hinduism and Sikhism honour the cow, and most don’t consume beef, the fact is there are a significant number of people who do regardless of faith. For many of the poorest Indians, it is a cheap and rich source of nutrition. And unless we can give them an option, we are in no position to judge.

And those who equate only slaughterhouses with cruelty may want to look into the dairy industry where cows are kept in inhumane conditions, forced to calve and driven so cruelly that their lifespan is cut by 15 years. And don’t even ask what happens in these places when a male calf is born. We might want to think this through before imposing a blanket ban.

8. Women safety schemes

themagzone

The ‘Nirbhaya Fund’ was announced by the UPA government in the 2013-14 budget with an agenda to help women with Rs 1,000 crore set aside for safety measures. Since then, an additional sum of Rs 2,000 crore has been added to fund the scheme via 2014-15 and 2015-16 budgets.

Yet, in four years and with over Rs 3,000 crores allocated, nothing substantial has been brought to the table. Some of the projects have ticked off and some of them are in the deliberation stage, yet, it is not as if the result is handy. Rapes are still a daily occurrence, minor girls are getting pregnant, molesters are moving freely, and we still have those in power who victim-shame.

9. Mann ki Baat

dnaindia

This one-way communication that happens on DD News, All India Radio, and DD National is a programme hosted by the Indian Prime Minister, where he talks about ideas and how this nation is growing. In 15 addresses of Mann ki Baat broadcast so far 61,000 ideas have been received on the website and Rs 1.43 lakh audio recordings by listeners have been received, but we are yet to figure out the outcome.

Ideas yet to be executed, grievances yet to be answered, and directions yet to be taken.

**Will Modi stop hoisting flag at Red Fort, asks Owaisi** 

 ______ 
Flaying BJP leader Sangeet Som’s remark that Taj Mahal was built by traitors, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday wondered if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would stop hoisting the national flag on Red Fort.

The Hyderabad MP said it was very unfortunate and shameful that a legislator who had taken oath on the constitution was speaking out of arrogance and ignorance.

“If what he says is true then why is Mr Modi going to Red Fort and hoisting national flag because Red Fort was also built by traitors,” Owaisi told reporters.

He also challenged the government to ask Unesco to remove Taj from the list of world heritage sites and ask tourists coming to India to stop visiting the monument.

Owaisi said Modi should also stop hosting foreign dignitaries at Hyderabad House as this too was built by “traitors”.

He said the BJP leaders were raking up such issues to divert people’s attention as their government at the Centre had failed in providing jobs, tackling terrorism, failed in dealing with China and was also facing flak from common man because of demonetisation and GST.

Voicing concern over the continuing attacks by “gaurakshaks” or cow vigilantes, he reiterated that Modi’s statement that attacks should stop was a mere lip service.

On plans by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to install a tall statue of Lord Ram, he said this was violation of the Supreme Court judgement that public money should not be used for construction, maintenance or reconstruction of places of worship.

The MP said this was another evidence of the priorities of the UP government. He said instead of installing statues, the government should focus on supplying oxygen and providing basic facilities to government-run hospitals as the lack of the same was resulting in deaths of hundreds of children.

**GST collective decision of all parties, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asserted that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime was a collective decision of all political parties and state governments and that the Centre was only a small part in the decision-making process.

Addressing a massive gathering of party workers in Gandhinagar, Modi said in Gujarati that all “political parties, including the Congress, took the decision to bring in GST. You are all partners in this decision”.

“The central government is only a 30th part in the entire GST Council,” the Prime Minister said, indicating that the responsibility for the problems because of the new tax regime could not be rest solely on his office.

“I had said it is a new tax regime and I will review it after three months. And we not only reviewed it, but are trying to resolve all ticklish issues and all gaps relating to it.

“I assure our huge trading community that the government is committed to ensure they have no problems because of the new reformist tax regime,” Modi said.

The Prime Minister claimed that thousands of new traders were coming up to join the GST regime but seeking simplicity in its implementation. “I have given my word to the traders that I will not allow them to suffer.

“Nobody is against GST, they all want that there should be no hurdles in its implementation. We are seized of it and am continuously making suggestions to address all concerns.”

**People to decide if Rahul can pose a realistic challenge to PM Modi in 2019, says Nitish** 

 ______ 
Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said here on Monday that the elevation of Rahul Gandhi as the Congress president may be a settled issue but the question as to whether he would become PM after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, would be decided by the people of the country.

“I have been hearing about Rahul’s expected elevation for quite some time now. If he becomes the Congress president, it is good. Even otherwise, he is the all in all in his party,” Kumar said while talking to the media after his weekly Lok Samvad programme.

Kumar was responding to a question on Rahul Gandhi’s imminent anointment as Congress chief, after Diwali, and whether he will be in a position to challenge the NDA in the next general election.

The chief minister said that though this was an internal matter of the Congress, everything in the party played out on the predicted format. “Rahul’s elevation is a no brainer. But the question regarding ‘who’ will become ‘what’ after 2019 elections will only be settled by the electorate,” he said.

Soon after he had dumped the Grand Alliance partners, the Congress and RJD, to form a new government with the support of estranged former partner—the BJP, in July, Kumar had practically ruled out any challenge to PM Narendra Modi in the 2019 poll.

“No one in the Opposition camp has the capacity to measure up to him.” He had stated in his first interaction with the media after he broke the grand alliance over RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s ‘refusal’ to answer corruption charges levelled against him by the CBI.

His criticism of the working of the Congress came a day after he lavished full praise on Narendra Modi, once again on Sunday, at a book release function, saying he was one PM who believed in leading from the front in doing what was in the best interest of the nation.

On being asked whether he was in agreement with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s assertion that states should bring real estate under the purview of GST, Kumar said he had already expressed support to the idea.

“But a decision in the matter could not be taken owing to paucity of time before the GST roll out. GST is a new thing and issues will be settled as they get flagged”, Kumar added.

In response to RJD chief Lalu Prasad terming him (Kumar) a ‘coward’, from whom he would never take support in future, the chief minister said he preferred not to speak on the subject involving a person who was facing the ‘logical outcome’ of his misdeeds.

**Gujarat polls a 'battle of pride' for BJP: Amit Shah** 

 ______ 
GANDHINAGAR: BJP chief Amit Shah on Monday termed the upcoming Gujarat assembly polls a ""battle of pride"" for the ruling party and exhorted the workers to ensure an improved tally of 150 seats over the 129 it won in 2002 under the then chief minister Narendra Modi Amit Shah slammed the Congress and asked BJP cadres to completely ""root out"" the party from the Prime Minister's home state.Speaking before Amit Shah, PM Modi praised his trusted lieutenant as the ""man of the match"" for the BJP's victory in the 2014 elections and also in the assembly polls held in Uttar Pradesh this year.The BJP president urged his party cadres to not sit idle and reach out to every citizen after Diwali to ensure a landslide victory.He appealed to BJP workers to ensure that the party wins three-fourth majority in the polls, due in December this year.""This is a battle of pride for us, as we want nothing short of three-fourth majority. As your president, I urge all party workers to give your 100 per cent. Do not sit idle after Diwali. I urge you to reach out to each and every citizen and spread Modiji's message of development,"" Amit Shah said while addressing ""Gujarat Gaurav Mahasammelan"".The rally was held a day after the conclusion of the party's 'Gujarat Guarav Yatra' aimed at mobilising public support ahead of the assembly polls.Noting that a two-third majority will not suffice this time, Shah recalled that the BJP had secured 129 seats when Modi was chief minister in 2002.""And now, when he is our Prime Minister, we must make and all-out bid to clinch 150 seats (out of the 182 in the Assembly),"" Shah said.He accused the Congress of showing ""fake"" concern for Gujarat without naming Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi who has been addressing rallies in various parts of the state and visited a number of temples.""For five years, you will not find these Congressmen anywhere. But as election approaches, they start claiming that they would win. In this election, BJP workers need to root out the Congress completely from Gujarat,"" the BJP chief said.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who was also present, announced his government will provide farm loan up to Rs 3 lakh at zero per cent interest to farmers.""Today, I want to announce that farmers in Gujarat would now get farm loans at zero per cent interest. Till now, they were charged one per cent whereas the state and Centre used to bear the remaining 6 per cent interest. For the welfare of around 25 lakh farming families, I hereby announce that one per cent would be waived too,"" the CM said.

**Don't pull security forces out of Darjeeling hills: Mamata to Centre** 

 ______ 
KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Rajnath Singh not to pull security forces out of Darjeeling hills and accused the Centre of ""conspiring to destabilize"" the state.Banerjee said she had sent letters to Modi and Singh on the withdrawal of the Central forces.""I have written to the prime minister and the home minister and asked them not to withdraw the forces from the hills. I hope we will receive a positive response...If something untoward happens in the hills, the Center will be responsible for it,"" she told a press conference at the state secretariat here after an all-party meeting on the Darjeeling situation.Describing the withdrawal decision as unilateral and unfortunate, Banerjee said, ""The Central government is being run from the BJP party office. It is really unfortunate that the central government has taken such a bad decision unilaterally to withdraw forces from the hills.""She accused the Centre and the BJP of hatching a conspiracy. ""They are conspiring to destabilize Bengal so that violence keeps on occurring,"" she said.Later, the Centre allowed continued deployment of 800 paramilitary personnel in Darjeeling to maintain law and order.As of now, 15 companies of paramilitary forces were deployed in Darjeeling and the central government wanted to withdraw 10 of them for deployment in other places for duties during festival season, a Union home ministry official said in Delhi.However, as the state government wanted to deploy the forces for more time, the home ministry, after a fresh assessment, decided to withdraw just seven companies and allowed the remaining eight companies to remain in the hill areas. A company of paramilitary comprises around 100 personnel.""Union home minister Rajnath Singh told me seven companies would be withdrawn. I want to ask why this step- motherly attitude towards Bengal when huge numbers of central forces are deployed in other states,"" the West Bengal chief minister said.Accusing BJP's Darjeeling MP and Union minister S S Ahluwalia of helping fugitive GJM supremo Bimal Gurung foment trouble in the region, she said the BJP was allowing the hills to ""burn for the sake of a seat"".""They (BJP) are willing to talk to those few people who have cases under UAPA against them. But they are not willing to talk to other hill parties who are genuinely trying to restore peace in the region. We condemn such double standards,"" Banerjee said.Asked why the state has failed to nab Gurung despite the presence of a huge number of central forces and state police in the hills, the chief minister said, ""It is because he (Gurung) is getting help from certain neighbouring states and northeastern insurgent groups. The MP from Darjeeling is also helping him.""On the issue of tripartite talks with the Centre on the statehood demand, Banerjee said nothing has been decided as of now.An all-party meeting decided to work together for the restoration of peace in the hills. It was attended by several hill parties excluding the Jan Andolan Party (JAP).Banerjee said the next such meeting would be held on November 21 at Pintail village in Darjeeling district.Briefing reporters about the all-party meeting, chairman of Board of Administrators for Darjeeling Binay Tamang said it discussed the issue of compensation for those who died during the three-month-long shutdown.""It was decided that the previous decision to break the service of GTA employees who were absent during the strike will be superseded and there will be no break of service for them,"" he said.Tamang said he had requested the state government to withdraw all police cases against GJM leaders and workers except Bimal Gurung, facing cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — UAPA.Tamang stressed on tripartite talks to solve the impasse in Darjeeling and said the state government should initiate the process.He also demanded that the West Bengal government immediately release the state plan budget funds for 2017-18 and the outstanding balance for 2015-16 and 2016-17.

**EC intentionally delaying Gujarat elections to favour Modi: Congress** 

 ______ 
The Congress on Monday accused the Election Commission of “intentionally delaying” announcement of Gujarat assembly elections to favour Prime Minister Narendra Modi who, the party said, was afraid of defeat after the Congress’s emphatic win in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha by-election.

“The EC has intentionally delayed announcement of date(s) for Gujarat elections just to favour Modi, to enable him to make tall, hollow promises to the people of Gujarat,” Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken told reporters after leading a party protest outside the poll panel’s office in central Delhi on the issue.

The Congress leader said the Modi government was afraid of defeat after the Congress party’s thumping victory for the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat in Punjab, where its candidates Sunil Kumar Jakhar won by a margin of over 1.93 lakh votes.

He demanded immediately announcement on dates for the Gujarat assembly elections.

On October 12, the EC announced that Himachal Pradesh assembly elections would be held on November 9 and the results declared on December 18.

The term of the 68-member Himachal assembly ends on January 7, 2018, and of the 182-member Gujarat assembly on January 22, 2018.

Maken also presented a memorandum to Chief Election Commissioner Achal Kumar Joti, wherein the party recalled that the Election Commission had on January 4 announced the election schedule for assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Manipur.

“Consequently, a Model Code of Conduct in all five states was imposed the same day. The EC took a conscious decision to announce the dates of all five states together so as to ensure that the governments in these states do not misuse their position to announce freebies on poll eve.”

Maken said that since 1998, assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat were held together, except in 2002-03 after the Godhra riots in Gujarat.

“We wonder why has the EC deviated from its usual practice and adopted a special approach not to declare date(s) for Gujarat elections along with Himachal Pradesh?” he asked.

“Now, the onus lies on the EC to ensure a level playing field by announcing Gujarat election date(s) and imposing the model code immediately,” he added.

**Modi attacks Congress in Gujarat, Talwars walk free after 4 years in jail, humour and sarcasm in Rahul’s campaign: Top stories** 

 ______ 
1- Gujarat election will be battle between development and dynasty politics: Modi attacks Cong on home turf

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday termed the Gujarat assembly elections as a battle between “vikasvaad” (development) and “vanshvaad” (dynasty), targeting the Congress on a range of issues, including GST, corruption and the party’s “anti-Gujarat stand”. Modi was addressing lakhs of BJP ‘page presidents’ (in-charges of electoral roll pages) on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in what could be his last big rally before elections are announced.

With Congress targeting the Modi government with a ‘Vikas Gandho thayo che’ (development has gone crazy) campaign on social media, the PM dared it to contest the polls on the development plank. “Communalism, casteism, dynastic rule, misleading the people — these are the instruments which Congress uses to win elections. They don’t have it in them to win on the issue of development,” the prime minister said.

2- Rahul issues ‘weather report’ for Gujarat, forecasts ‘jumlon ki baarish’ ahead of election

Rhetoric will rain down on Gujarat, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said in a “weather report” ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to his home state on Monday. Gandhi’s dig comes in the wake of speculation that the prime minister may announce a host of sops for poll-bound Gujarat. “Weather report: Ahead of elections, Gujarat will today have rain of rhetoric,” he said on Twitter, using the phrase “jumlon ki baarish” in his Hindi tweet. The Congress vice president also tagged a Hindustan Times report headlined “As Gujarat waits for poll date, state gets projects worth nearly Rs 12,500 crore” with his tweet.

3- Humour and sarcasm give new edge to Rahul Gandhi’s social media campaign

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi is mixing humour and sarcasm more often to pack a new punch in his social media campaigns ahead of elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. Political rivals have often criticised and ridiculed the Gandhi scion for what they say is his failure to communicate well with the electorate, calling him a confused leader. However, after his recent visit to the US, experts said Gandhi looked more confident and spoke impressively. The renewed vigour in the Congress vice president’s Twitter strategy is evident in his posts. On Monday, Gandhi turned a weatherman, declaring on Twitter that a spell of rhetoric would rain down on Gujarat ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the election-bound state.

The ruling BJP is the richest among India’s seven national parties, having declared assets worth nearly Rs 894 crore in 2015-16, said a report released by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) on Monday. The document collated by the advocacy group went on to term the Congress, which declared assets to the tune of Rs 759 crore in the same period, as a close second on the list. While the BJP was found to have declared liabilities of around Rs 25 crore during that time, the figure for the Congress stood at Rs 329 crore. The report was based on the declaration of assets and liabilities by national parties from 2004-05 to 2015-16.

5- Day not far when BJP will try to change country’s name: Mamata Banerjee

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday lashed out against BJP leader Sangeet Som’s comments on the Taj Mahal, saying it was “a manifestation of the BJP’s political agenda” and said the day was not far when the party will try to change the country’s name as well. Som had said

that the Taj Mahal - one of India’s top tourist destinations and a world heritage site -- was built by “invaders” and was a “blot” on Indian culture and history. Banerjee alleged that the BJP was coming up with such statements to “divide the people”. The Trinamool Congress chief said: “The less we talk about the BJP leaders the better. I feel ashamed to speak on comments made by them. They are not doing any development work, but only making divisive statements with a political agenda. We don’t believe in dividing people like this.”

The BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government distanced itself on Monday from controversial comments by firebrand MLA Sangeet Som, who questioned the Taj Mahal’s place in history and said the iconic monument was built by “traitors” who targeted Hindus. “The chief minister has made it clear that the Taj is part of our heritage. My government has already sanctioned Rs 155 crore for the development of parks and various facilities in and around Taj,” said state tourism minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi. When asked what she made of the BJP lawmaker’s claims, she said, “Well, every individual is free to make an opinion but as far as the government is concerned Taj is very much on our priority list.”

Advisories in this regard have been issued to all states twice this year, the latest being last month. Sources in MHA maintain that all precautions are being taken to avoid security breaches. The trigger for these advisories was related to a visit made by PM Modi Madhya Pradesh’s Alirajpur district in August last year.

Madrid on Monday warned Catalonia’s separatist leader that he has only three days left to “return to legality” after he refused to say whether he would follow through on a threat to declare independence from Spain. Responding to an initial deadline set by the central government, Carles Puigdemont called for talks with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy “as soon as possible” as Spain struggles with its worst political crisis in decades. But Puidgemont stopped short of giving a definitive “yes or no” as demanded by Madrid, and Spain gave him until Thursday morning to clarify. Anything less than a full climb-down by Thursday’s 0800 GMT deadline is likely to prompt moves by Madrid to impose direct control over the semi-autonomous region -- the so-called “nuclear option.”

**‘Gujarat an eyesore for Congress’: How PM Modi targeted Nehru-Gandhi family on home turf** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi targeted the Congress on Monday and said the Opposition party didn’t win elections on developmental issues but employed caste, religion and their dynastic rule to mislead the people.

The Prime Minister was addressing lakhs of BJP workers on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in what could be his last big rally before Gujarat election dates are announced and the model code of conduct comes into force.

The rally was held to mark the conclusion of BJP’s Gujarat Gaurav Yatra (march for Gujarat’s honour) ahead of the high-octane electoral battle for the state where the party holds sway.

Here are five key points from PM Modi’s speech:

Congress ‘conspiracy’

Modi said there was a “conspiracy” was by the Congress to put him in jail, in an apparent reference to accusations of his involvement in the 2002 post-Godhra riots.

“You did not waste any opportunity to strike. When I was the chief minister and you were in power at the Centre, you hatched a conspiracy to put me in jail. You knew that it was not possible until Amit Shah (BJP chief) was put behind bars, you did that.”

“This is the poison, the malice you harbour. Since Patel conceived the Narmada project, it was not allowed to be completed for 40-50 years,” Modi said as he repeatedly attacked the Nehru-Gandhi family in his speech.

Referring to Congress leaders, including party president Sonia Gandhi and her deputy Rahul Gandhi being on bail in the National Herald case, Modi said,”The whole party is on bail”.

Development vs dynasty

Modi employed juxtapositions to describe the ideologies of the rival parties ahead of Gujarat assembly elections.

“This election is a duel between “vikasvaad” (development) and “vanshvaad” (dynastic) rule. Development is going to win and dynastic rule is going to lose,” he said.

“Communalism, casteism, dynastic rule, misleading the people — these are the instruments which Congress uses to win elections. They don’t have it in them to win on the issue of development.” Modi said.

The prime minister’s remark came against the backdrop of the agitation by the influential Patel community for reservations in government jobs and educational institutions. Hardik Patel, the quota stir spearhead, had welcomed Rahul Gandhi on a recent visit to Gujarat.

“They called us anti-Dalit, anti-Adivasi, an urban party. The people gave them an apt reply. None of the charges stuck. Today, we have the highest number of Dalit and Adivasi MPs. The highest number of MPs from rural areas are of the BJP,” he said.

Congress ‘doesn’t like’ Gujarat

Modi accused the Congress of treating Gujarati leaders “unfairly” and named first home minister Sardar Patel and former prime minister Morarji Desai among the party’s victims. “They don’t like Gujarat and Gujaratis. Gujarat has been an eyesore for the party and the family.”

“When Morarji Desai became prime minister, they spread rumours about what he drank and what he didn’t. They didn’t talk about his ideals, about his dedication to Mahatma Gandhi’s cause,” he said.

‘Misguiding’ the country on GST

The Prime Minister also slammed the opposition party for “misguiding” the country on GST, and clarified that the tax rates are fixed by a panel comprising ministers of all the states, including those ruled by the Congress.

“GST decisions are not taken by Modi or Parliament. All parties, all states, are its part. Central government is its 30th part. Congress is also a partner in GST decisions. They should not spread lies on GST,” he said, assuring the Gujarati business community that he will “not allow them to suffer”.

Black money-free day

On demonetisation, another issue being aggressively raised by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in Gujarat, Modi said, “I have read that the Congress is going to observe November 8 as ‘black day’. BJP, on the other hand, will celebrate it as a ‘black money-free day’. He added licences of over two lakh shell companies have been cancelled following the banning of the old 500- and 1000-rupee notes.

“The Congress is neck deep in corruption. Its leadership is out on bail. Will you allow such a party to rule in Gujarat?” Modi asked.

**Narendra Modi: Congress an equal partner in GST decision**

Gandhinagar: The goods and services tax (GST) was a collective decision of various state governments in which the Centre had a small role to play and the Congress was “an equal partner”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Gandhinagar on Monday.

“The Congress is an equal partner in GST decision and it should not spread lies about GST. The decision was not taken by Parliament or Narendra Modi. The decision was made by governments of all political parties, including the Congress governments of Punjab, Karnataka, and Meghalaya,” Modi said.

The prime minister said the central government was “only the 30th part” in the decision which was taken in consultation with 29 states. “You are equally responsible for the decision,” he said while addressing a huge rally of BJP party workers in poll-bound Gujarat at Bhat village.

Modi said he has been in touch with businessmen after the launch of the GST and claimed they like the system because it has freed them from bureaucratic red tape. He said, as promised, his government reviewed the way the new indirect tax regime was working after three months following which several changes were made to fulfil their demands. He also assured the business community that the government is trying to sort out problems they are still facing.

“I’m sure that businessmen of the country need this system, but they demand simplicity. This is being put before the GST (Council) and discussed collectively,” he said.

The prime minister also tried to assuage the concerns of the trading community about penal action they might face for their past accounting. The prime minister said a “fear psychosis” was being created over the issue. Modi said businessmen will not need to adjust their past books to synchronise them with the new system.

Modi also attacked the Congress over observing 8 November, the day demonetisation was announced last year, as “black day”, something which his government would celebrate as “black money mukti diwas” (day of freedom from black money). Modi said following demonetisation, the sources of origin of Rs3 trillion of dubious money are being probed and his government has shut down 2.10 lakh companies without any protest. “So far we have shut down 2.10 lakh companies and there has been no protest or burning of Modi’s effigy,” he said.

**India should stand by ally Sheikh Hasina on the Rohingya crisis** 

 ______ 
Few in India seem to understand the scale of the Rohingya crisis that has overwhelmed Bangladesh.

In the space of six weeks, half a million people, men, women and children, have fled Myanmar to seek shelter across the choppy waters of the Naf River which marks the borders between the two countries. Top UN officials say that the crisis is continuing with people “fleeing for their lives and requiring immediate support” in the world’s fastest developing refugee situation.

The refugees come struggling ashore, climbing uncertainly down from country boats and settle usually on a small spit of land on the river bank before they are taken to makeshift shelters where they often stand in rain and in muddy slush waiting for food.

The issue is front page news every day in Bangladesh in Bangla and the English media, the top anchors and talk shows are all about this. When Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister, returned to Dhaka recently from a long visit to the United Nations and London, she was welcomed with banners with proclaimed her as “Mother of Humanity”. She had campaigned for the Rohingya, for Myanmar to end its devastating assault and urged international support to meet the pressures on Bangladesh.

The view from Dhaka is very different to that in Delhi and the feeling one gained from an intense visit was that many in the country, not least Sheikh Hasina, were stunned by India’s position on the crisis. While there may be understanding of the assertion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Aung San Suu Kyi to fight terrorism, especially after the coordinated attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on the Myanmar army and police positions, it has also been strongly felt that New Delhi should have counselled restraint to Myanmar.

A former diplomat familiar with the Rohingya situation spoke of how overreach, credible accounts of brutality and collateral damage by security forces in the Arakan could create a new security threat to Eastern South Asia: such violence and prejudice could be a magnet for jihadi elements from different parts of the world, who were being tossed out of Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. People in Myanmar who are knowledgeable of the situation say that this patch of land along the Bay of Bengal is where the Pakistani ISI is already involved, supporting ARSA.

Apart from the proximity to Bangladesh, where there has been a surge in violent extremism, one cannot forget that the area abuts parts of the North-east. There is growing communal tension in Assam on a range of issues. The BJP-led alliance there cannot ignore this visible trend and yet appears to be either unwilling or unable to counter it. Wisdom should inform political leaders that relentless discrimination and abuse of minority groups will push the latter to the wall and lead to radicalisation. Should that happen, then the ease of connectivity can enable collaboration with elements in Bangladesh and Myanmar, making eastern South Asia potentially unstable. The Act East Policy would be adversely affected.

That is why India’s support to Sheikh Hasina is critical at this juncture. At talk shows and commentaries, her party leaders as also panelists known to be pro-India are pointedly asked – “You gave transit, what did you get in return?” “You gave the information gateway, what did you get in return?” “You haven’t got a drop of Teesta waters”. On the Rohingyas, where India is seen to have supported Suu Kyi and the army crackdown, Bangladesh is portrayed as helplessly trying to cope with the massive influx.

Sheikh Hasina is seen as overdependent on India. This is an especially sensitive issue with a year to go for the general elections where her Awami League will be contesting against the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-i-Islami. Despite handicaps and the criticism of the vast power concentrated in her hands, she remains the only credible popular choice which India must continue to back. She has taken enormous political risks to go the extra mile with India — opening economic and transport routes, including access to Chittagong port, handing over top insurgent leaders, providing an information gateway and helping Modi clinch the border agreement.

There are two issues where India’s help is critical: First, Teesta water sharing for the dry winter months, without which Bangladeshi farmers face disaster. This should not be done closer to the elections — it would be regarded as an election gimmick. Second, use its influence to quietly engage Suu Kyi and the generals to enable the return of some refugees and the restoration of an initial peace. Discussions with ARSA are probably some time away: there are reports that Bangladesh intelligence may be connected to some ARSA leaders, part of the usual South Asian game of stealth and power, as earlier with ULFA and other groups.

**What's the 'izzat ghar' that PM Modi has been talking about? - Times of India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has of late been referring to something called 'izzat ghar', or 'home of honour'.He did so today, too, as he dedicated the first ever All India Institute of Ayurveda to the nation on the occasion of the second 'Ayurveda Day'.But what is this 'izzat ghar'? A hint: It has a connection to the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', or the 'Clean India' program, a campaign close to the PM's heart.Here's what PM Modi said today: ""I was happy when I was told that newly constructed toilets in UP have 'Izzat ghar' written on them and not 'shauchalay'"", said PM Modi.'Shauchalay' translates to 'toilet' and sounds decidedly more common than 'izzat ghar'. The PM believes that too.This novel nomenclature is the brainchild of the UP government. Last month, the PM visited Varanasi to lay the foundation stone for a toilet at a village about 30 kilometres from town. That's where he encountered 'izzat ghar'.""When I was laying the foundation stone for toilets at a village, I saw 'izzat ghar' written on them. I was happy to see the name. I congratulate the state government for coining this name,"" said Modi at the time.In April this year, the world's richest man Bill Gates said ""India is winning the war on human waste."" He lauded the PM for not just devisingbut for also talking about the issue of human waste.""Nearly three years ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made one of the boldest comments on public health that I have ever heard from an elected official...I can't think of another time when a national leader has broached such a sensitive topic so frankly and so publicly,"" wrote Gates about the PM's 2014 Independence Day address to the nation.

**Time for Ayurveda-led 'health revolution', says Modi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Underscoring the importance of Ayurveda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said time has come for a "" health revolution "" under the aegis of the traditional medicine system and pitched for affordable and accessible healthcare.Addressing a gathering after dedicating the country's first All India Institute of Ayurveda to the nation here, the prime minister noted that the world is heading ""back to nature and wellness"".Marking 'Ayurveda Divas' today, he described the medicine system as India's strength and urged those working in the sector to revive it. He also asked experts from the field to find medicines which can, like allopathy, give immediate relief to people but without side-effects.The prime minister also urged private players to use part of their corporate social responsibility funds to help strengthen Ayurveda.""We have seen the IT revolution in last 30 years. Now, time has come for a health revolution under the aegis of Ayurveda. Let's pledge to strengthen, revive Ayurveda,"" Modi said at the event.According to the prime minister, efforts were allegedly made to destroy ""India's strengths"" during the ""era of slavery"" (pre-independence period). Ayurveda, he added, did not become a priority after independence too.Listing steps being taken by his government to revive and strengthen the system, Modi said Ayurveda-related hospitals should be set up in each district of the country.He said the Ayush ministry would ensure that there was a good Ayurveda hospital in each district.Noting that people across the world were getting attracted towards good health as well as wellness, the prime minister suggested that time was ripe for an atmosphere of Ayurveda to evolve.He said there was need for a relook of the Ayurveda syllabus and underlined the requirement for standard guidelines and treatment in the medicine system so it is not overpowered by Allopathy.The government, Modi added, respects all health and medicine systems.He said the Ministries of Ayush and Agriculture can guide farmers to sow medicinal plants in their fields. This will also help farmers boost their income in line with the government's plan to double their income by 2022, when India attains 75 years of independence.Modi also reiterated the importance of cleanliness as part of preventive healthcare.

@narendramodi My son has just married a Gujarati, @narendramodi ji. We have nothing but love for your state &amp;its people. — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) 1508175791000

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday responded with a message of ""love"" a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleged the party had ""special hatred"" for Gujarat and denied the people of the state their due.""My son has just married a Gujarati, Narendra Modi ji. We have nothing but love for your state and its people,"" Tharoor said in a tweet.Tharoor's son Ishaan, a foreign affairs witer at the Washington Post, recently tied the knot with fellow journalist Bhumika Dave in the US.The Congress MP's riposte came in response to the fierce salvos directed against his party by PM Modi at a saffron rally in poll-bound Gujarat.Accusing the Congress of being anti-Gujarat, the Prime Minister claimed the party had done nothing for the state's development in the last 70 years and had also slighted prominent Gujarati leaders.""Gujarat has been an eyesore for the party and the family. I won't repeat what they did to Sardar Patel , his daughter Maniben and Morarji Desai ,"" he said at a 'Gujarat Gaurav Sammelan' in Gandhinagar on Monday.The BJP and Congress have been engaged in war of words ahead of the high-octane electoral battle for Gujarat where the saffron party holds sway. While the BJP has been rattling its sabre of development, Congress has rolled out the 'Vikas gando thayo che (development has gone crazy)' campaign on social media and at public meetings to run down the ruling party's development plank.PM Modi, who has been projected as 'vikas purush' by his supporters, also dared Congress to fight elections on the development agenda.""I had expected them to fight this election on the issue of development, but they are not doing that. Now they have decided to belittle Gujarat's development,"" he jibed.

**Prime Minister Narendra Modi Promises Ayurveda Hospital In Every District** 

 ______ 
PM Modi said the Ayush Ministry would ensure that there was a good Ayurveda
hospital in each district

**New Delhi: **

Underscoring the importance of Ayurveda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today
said time has come for a ""health revolution"" led by the traditional medicine
system and pitched for affordable and accessible healthcare.

Addressing a gathering after dedicating the country's first All India
Institute of Ayurveda to the nation, the prime minister noted that the world
is heading ""back to nature and wellness"".

Marking 'Ayurveda Divas' today, he described the medicine system as India's
strength and urged those working in the sector to revive it. He also asked
experts from the field to find medicines which can, like allopathy, give
immediate relief to people but without side-effects.

The prime minister also urged private players to use part of their corporate
social responsibility funds to help strengthen Ayurveda.

""We have seen the IT revolution in last 30 years. Now, time has come for a
health revolution under the aegis of Ayurveda. Let's pledge to strengthen,
revive Ayurveda,"" PM Modi said.

Listing steps being taken by his government to revive and strengthen the
system, PM Modi said Ayurveda-related hospitals should be set up in each
district of the country.

He said the Ayush Ministry would ensure that there was a good Ayurveda
hospital in each district.

Noting that people across the world were getting attracted towards good health
as well as wellness, the prime minister suggested that time was ripe for an
atmosphere of Ayurveda to evolve.

He said there was need for a relook of the Ayurveda syllabus and underlined
the requirement for standard guidelines and treatment in the medicine system
so it is not overpowered by Allopathy.

The government, PM Modi added, respects all health and medicine systems.

He said the Ministries of Ayush and Agriculture can guide farmers to sow
medicinal plants. This will also help farmers boost their income in line with
the government's plan to double their income by 2022, when India attains 75
years of independence.

PM Modi also reiterated the importance of cleanliness as part of preventive
healthcare.

(PTI Photo/File)

After #pomonemodi and #pomoneshahji, a new viral hashtag on Twitter has emerged from Kerala. #GougeDa is Malayalis’ response to BJP national general secretary Saroj Pandey issuing a threat that if the Left party continues to “show eyes” to BJP workers in Kerala, the latter would respond by “entering homes and gouging out those eyes”.

Pandey, on the sidelines of an inauguration in Kumhari, had said, “Hum logon ne ye jo march ki shuruwat ki hai, hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh-ji ne ki hai, vo isliye ki hai ki aanewale samay mein agar baar baar hamaare karyakarta ke saath mein isi prakaar se aise aankh dikhaane ki stithi hogi, toh hum ghar mein ghus kar aankh nikal lenge. Yeh tay baat hai” (This march that we have started, that our national president has started, was to ensure that in future if our workers are shown eyes repeatedly, then it is certain that we will enter homes and gouge those eyes out).

Pandey’s warning came as the party in Kerala gets ready to conclude its ‘Jan Raksha Yatra’ in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday against violence perpetrated by CPM workers in the state.

In response to the stern warning, Malayalis on Twitter are putting out photographs of themselves and popular actors wearing sunglasses with the hashtag #gougeda — basically telling the BJP that their plan to gouge their eyes will not work. In solidarity with the people of Kerala, folks from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were also seen posting pictures.

The #pomonemodi hashtag had gone viral after Prime Minister Narendra Modi compared the health indicators in Kerala to Somalia at an election rally in the state. Angry netizens in Kerala responded with the hashtag #pomonemodi – which is loosely translated to ‘get lost Modi’. It is a phrase that was fashioned out of a popular film dialogue of Mohanlal in which he tells the villain to ‘get lost’.

New Delhi: The government is working towards setting up an Ayurveda hospital in each district of the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday and asserted that time had come for a “health revolution” under the aegis of the traditional medicine system.

Addressing a gathering after dedicating the country’s first All India Institute of Ayurveda to the nation in New Delhi, the prime minister pitched for affordable and accessible healthcare for the poor on ‘Ayurveda Day’ today.

The day is also being celebrated as Dhanwantari Jayanti (Dhanteras) across India. “It is very necessary for the expansion of Ayurveda that there is a good hospital with all facilities... in every district of the country.

“The AYUSH ministry is working swiftly in this direction, and in more than three years, more than 65 Ayush hospitals have been developed,” Modi said.

Noting that the world was heading “back to nature and wellness”, Modi described Ayurveda as India’s strength and urged those working in the sector to revive it.

He also asked experts from the field to find medicines which can, like allopathy, give immediate relief to people but without side-effects. Noting that people across the world were getting attracted towards good health as well as wellness, the prime minister suggested that time was ripe for an “atmosphere of Ayurveda”. He also batted for better and modern packaging of ayurvedic medicines.

The prime minister urged private players to use part of their corporate social responsibility funds to help strengthen Ayurveda.

“We have seen the IT revolution in last 30 years. Now, time has come for a health revolution under the aegis of Ayurveda. Let’s pledge to strengthen, revive Ayurveda,” Modi said at the event.

The prime minister suggested a relook at the existing Ayurveda syllabus and underlined the requirement for standard guidelines and treatment in the medicine system so it is not overpowered by allopathy.

Modi pitched for awarding certificates after the completion of each level of Ayurveda education. Terming swachhata (cleanliness) a simple preventive healthcare mechanism, he said the Union government had built more than five crore toilets in three years.

“People’s perception about cleanliness has changed which is reflected in the fact in some people have started referring to toilets as ‘izzat ghar’.”

According to the prime minister, efforts were allegedly made to destroy “India’s strengths” and its traditions such as Yoga and Ayurveda were belittled during the “era of slavery” (pre-independence period).

“Attempts were even made to reduce the faith that Indians had on them. However, after getting freedom from slavery, there was hope that whatever was left would be preserved.

“But it did not become a priority. Things were left to fate. Those nations who leave their heritage behind are destined to lose their identity,” he said. He said the Ayush ministry in collaboration with the Ministry of Skill Development should develop short term courses for students and farmers.

The farming of medicinal plants will generate new employment opportunities. Modi added that the Ministries of Ayush and Agriculture could guide farmers on how to sow medicinal plants in their fields.

This would also help farmers boost their income in line with the government’s plan to double their income by 2022, when India attains 75 years of independence. The Ayurveda institute, the prime minister said, would work in collaboration with the AIIMS, Indian Concil of Medical Research and some international organisations.

He expressed the hope that it would turn into a main centre of inter- disciplinary and integrative health practices.

**PM Modi inaugurates AIIMS-like institute for ayurveda in Delhi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated the first ever 200-bed ayurveda hospital on the lines of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi and said his government plans to establish such traditional medical institutes in every district of the country. (Highlights)

“There is a strong need to integrate traditional and modern systems of medicines. This ayurveda hospital, which is like AIIMS, is equipped with most advanced technologies needed to treat patients,” Modi said as he launched the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) on the National Ayurveda Day.

The AIIA, which will function under the ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy or AYUSH, aims to offer quality patient care and become a research hub in generating scientific information about quality, safety, and efficacy of ayurvedic products.

Modi said a country cannot move forward if it is not proud of its legacy. “We forgot our legacy for a long time...But now we have started remembering it again,” the Prime Minister said.

He said there’s a long list of benefits of ayurveda and added that people are showing interest in traditional medicines.

“People are attracted not only to good health but also wellness... [There is a] need to strengthen ayurveda,” the Prime Minister said. “Like the IT revolution a few years ago, the time has come for a ‘health revolution’ under the aegis of ayurveda,” he added.

“More investment is needed in this sector for better growth,” Modi said as he appealed to private companies to contribute a part of their corporate social responsibility funds towards developing yoga and ayurveda.

The AIIA’s outpatient department (OPD) facility started functioning a few months ago and deals with neurological and degenerative diseases, rheumatology and musculoskeletal conditions, diabetes and metabolic disorders, allergic disorders, yoga, panchakarma, kriyakalpa, diabetic retinopathy and infertility among other conditions.

The first phase of the hospital was built with a budget of Rs 157 crore.

The hospital has a panchakarma therapy clinic that provides personalised care, laboratories, and diagnostic labs that conduct specialised pathology, biochemistry, microbiology tests and radiology scans.

It also teaches post-graduate students, PhD courses, and skill development programme.

“The idea is to popularise integrated medicine system. So far, allopathic doctors and those practising traditional systems of medicine have been working in silos, however, there is a need to break that practice and encourage them to work in tandem,” a senior AYUSH ministry official said.

**What 'equal partners'? BJP distorted GST's spirit: Congress** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday accused the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of distorting the Goods and Services Tax GST ) as envisioned by the former.""The BJP government totally distorted the spirit behind the GST, as envisaged by the Congress. In both spirit and implementation, the end-product is drastically different from the policy that the Congress conceived,"" it said.The party was responding to PM Modi's remarks on Monday, calling the Congress ""an equal partner"" in decisions about the newly-introduced tax regime.""I want to tell my friends that Congress is an equal partner in GST decisions. They should not spread lies on GST,"" he had said in an address to BJP workers at his 'Gujarat Gaurav Mahasammelan' in Gandhinagar.The Congress claimed that the current GST ""is anything but 'One Nation, One Tax',"" given the five different tax slabs.To highlight the differences between the GST it had proposed, and the one adopted by the current BJP government, it claimed that its concept of GST had tax rates capped at 18 per cent and provisions for a dispute resolution mechanism between the states and the Centre.""So, in what way does Mr Modi think the Congress is an ""equal partner"" in GST? The GST that has been finally implemented has distorted the Congress' vision and will require many amendments to become feasible,"" it said.

**Ahead of Diwali, good news for Indian economy** 

 ______ 
While favourable macroeconomic data is welcome, the challenge before the government is to stimulate investments into the Indian economy and to add new jobs. Photo: HT

New Delhi: A series of economic data has delivered a dose of good news since the middle of last week, making it one of the best times for the Indian economy in several months.

Data ranging from cooling of inflation to a rebound in exports and factory output suggest a favourable shift in the economic climate, recovering from the disruption caused by rollout of goods and services tax (GST) and the aftershocks of the Narendra Modi government’s demonetisation move. The trend gives optimism to experts for an uptick in economic growth rate in the coming quarters.

Retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI), which was inching up for three months since June, paused in September, while inflation based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which was following a similar trend in the period, decelerated in September. The decline in inflation was led by a correction in prices of food.

Industrial production rebounded to a nine-month high in August to 4.3% as manufacturers stepped up production ahead of the festive season. What is good news for the policy makers is that August data suggested a recovery in capital goods production, taken as a proxy for investments in the economy, from a sustained contraction since the beginning of the financial year. It expanded 5.4% in August.

Merchandise exports grew at 25.7% in September, its fastest pace in six months, to $28.6 billion, which helped trade deficit to narrow to a seventh-month low of $8.9 billion.

The data support the optimism of policymakers and experts that the impact of recent structural reforms have begun to wane and economic growth, which had slowed down to 5.7% in the June quarter from 6.1% in the preceding three months, is getting back to normal.

Rajiv Kumar, vice-chairman of federal policy think tank NITI Aayog, said the economic slowdown that began in 2013-14 has bottomed out and that gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to grow 6.9-7% in the current financial year and by 7.5% in 2018-19, PTI reported on Sunday.

Kumar had earlier told Mint that he endorsed the Asian Development Bank’s 2017 GDP growth forecast of 7% for India. The multilateral agency, which follows a calendar year, last month revised its 2017 growth forecast for India to 7% from its July estimate of 7.4% while stating that “short-term disruptions” will “dissipate”.

Experts said that while these sets of macroeconomic data indicated some improvement, one needed to watch whether this will sustain over the next few months.

“For instance, the year-on-year pace of growth of electricity generation, Coal India Ltd’s production and automobile production, have declined in September relative to August, which may dampen the rise in Index of Industrial Production in September to some extent. Exports, on the other hand, may witness improvement in volume growth in October, following the decisions of the GST Council,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist, Icra Ltd.

The challenge before the government is to stimulate investments into the Indian economy and to add new jobs. The high level of indebtedness of businesses and bad assets weighing on banks’ ability to lend also need to be resolved.

**PM Modi urges India Inc to invest more in ayurveda** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Pitching for affordable and accessible healthcare, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the time has come for a ""health revolution"" through ayurveda and the corporate sector must invest to strengthen the traditional stream of medicine by means of more research.""We have seen the IT revolution in last 30 years. Now, the time has come for a health revolution under ayurveda. Let's pledge to strengthen, revive ayurveda,"" Modi said, addressing a gathering after inaugurating the country's first All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), an apex institute under the AYUSH ministry, built on a campus area of over 10 acres with a budget of Rs 157 crore.Emphasising the importance of ayurveda, Modi said the world is heading ""back to nature and wellness"" and urged private players to use part of their CSR funds to help strengthen the field.He also asked experts from the field to find medicines which can, like allopathy, give immediate relief to people but without side-effects. The Prime Minister said that the government is working towards establishing an ayurveda hospital in every district of the country.More than 65 AYUSH hospitals have already been developed in the last three years, he added.AIIA, built on the lines of AIIMS, has an NABH-accredited hospital and an academic block. The hospital will provide outpatient services and free medicines.Currently, it will offer clinical services in the area of neurological &amp; degenerative diseases, rheumatology &amp; musculoskeletal care, diabetes &amp; metabolic disorders and yoga.It will also house a panchakarma clinic, kriya kalpa, diabetic retinopathy clinic, kshara evum anushastra karma and an infertility clinic. Besides, the institute also has pathology, biochemistry, microbiology and radiology laboratories and diagnosis facilities. The indoor patient department has provision for 200 beds.Marking 'Ayurveda Divas' on Tuesday, Modi described the medicine system as India's strength and urged those working in the sector to revive it.He said there was a need to revise the ayurveda syllabus and underlined the requirement for standard guidelines and treatment in the medicine system so that it is not overpowered by allopathy.He also said the ministries of AYUSH and agriculture can guide farmers to sow medicinal plants in their fields. This will also help farmers boost their income in line with the government's plan to double their income by 2022, when India attains 75 years of independence, he said.

AGRA: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has sought an explanation from BJP MLA Sangeet Som on his controversial statement on the Taj Mahal Top sources in the BJP confirmed that the MLA has been asked to explain the reason for making the statement that caused a huge row and embarrassment for the party. Sources also claimed that the chief minister has decided to visit the 17th century architectural marvel during his proposed visit to the city on Oct 26 in order to put the controversy to rest.When contacted, BJP state spokesperson Chandra Mohan said that the party does not agree with the Sardhana MLA's remarks. He said Som's views on Taj are ""completely his own"". ""Our party is doing a lot for development of tourism in Agra and we are making schemes for the same,"" he said.Meanwhile, the chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Shia Waqf Board on Tuesday jumped into the controversy surrounding the Taj Mahal, saying that the monument cannot be a symbol of ""worship"". He also alleged that ""most Mughals were aiyaash (dissolute)"".""The Taj Mahal can be a symbol of love but not of worship. Apart from one or two, most Mughals were 'aiyaash'. Muslims don't consider them idols,"" chairman Syed Waseem Rizvi said.On Monday, Som had questioned why the monument, which was built by a Mughal emperor ""who tried to wipe out Hindus"", is considered part of India's culture and history, and threatened to ""change that history"".The BJP MLA's comments had attracted strong criticism from various quarters, including from AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi, who demanded to know if PM Modi will ""stop hoisting Tiranga"" from the Red Fort, since it was also built by ""traitors"".

**One chart that shows how Rahul Gandhi is challenging Narendra Modi on Twitter** 

 ______ 
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi is capturing social media traction, evident from the high volume of retweets that the Twitter latecomer is getting for his punchy posts of late.

According to a Hindustan Times analysis of nearly three years’ of tweets by three powerful rivals, people retweeted Gandhi in recent weeks more than Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the first and second most-followed Indian politicians on the micro-blogging site.

The 47-year-old Gandhi’s upswing points to a shift in his online communication strategy.

“We became more timely in terms of reactions, speaking on issues that were hot topics at the moment, and getting more of our members online,” said Divya Spandana, the Congress’s social media head since this July.

Reports say Gandhi gained more than one million followers between July and September. Recent tweets underscore the renewed social media vigour of a leader once ridiculed and reviled with negative tweets, jokes, memes and videos.

“Modi ji quick; looks like President Trump needs another hug,” posted his Twitter handle, @OfficeOfRG, on October 15. It was retweeted more than 19,700 times.

The tweet carried a screenshot of US President Donald Trump’s post about mending relations with Pakistan, a country he criticised after Modi met and hugged him this summer in Washington.

An analysis of tweets since 2015 till the first fortnight of this October shows how the Twitter battlefield has transformed over the past three years.

The first quarter of 2015 belonged to Kejriwal, riding on his Aam Aadmi Party’s victory in the Delhi assembly elections. He got 1,665 retweets on an average for every tweet he posted, compared to 1,342 for Modi.

In May 2015, Gandhi posted his first tweet and in the next 12 months, Modi raced ahead of Kejriwal. By next summer, the Congress leader upped his game but the Prime Minister was still way ahead.

Gandhi surpassed his rivals this September, averaging 2,784 retweets as against 2,506 for Modi and 1,722 for Kejriwal.

His average retweets spiked to 3,812 till mid-October, approaching Modi’s two best months since 2015. The Prime Minister averaged 4,074 retweets last November, the month he announced scrapping the 500- and 1,000-rupee notes in a shock demonetisation drive, and 4,055 this July when Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar rejoined the BJP-led NDA.

Congress social media head Spandana attributed the success to Gandhi’s tweeting style and efforts of the party’s grassroots workers, who got trained at workshops in the past months.

According to Joyojeet Pal, a professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Information, the Congress leader’s clever and witty phrases, combined with an increased use of Hindi, have made his tweets more retweetable.

A higher retweet rate is often associated with the followers’ desire to consciously spread a politician’s message, he said.

The BJP played down Gandhi’s Twitter rise. The party’s IT cell head, Amit Malviya, said the Congress leader’s performance should be compared with that of Union minister Smriti Irani and not the Prime Minister, whose “account has a dignified presence”.

The Aam Aadmi Party doubted if the retweets were real.

Ankit Lal, who leads the AAP’s social media team, alleged tweets of Modi and Gandhi were retweeted through fake profiles and automated bots. The Congress dismissed the allegation.

448,"*In explaining Modi's image, sociologist and long-time observer of Modi Achyut Yagnaik says that Modi is the best ""brand manager"" India has seen. Modi excels in creating and projecting his image as a pro-development, pro-business leader in a way no one else has been able to do. Long-time Gujarat observers point out, however, this competitive edge was not initiated by Modi; the migration of Maharashtra's industrial base to Gujarat began as soon as the two separate states were created in 1960. Gujarat's attractiveness accelerated in the 1980s, as subsequent Congress, then BJP, state government deliberately targeted Mumbai's industrialists, and coaxed many to leave Maharashtra for Gujarat with pro-business policies. Modi also has his detractors: smaller businessmen resent his preference for big projects and the industrialists who build them; development workers and opponents also take great pains to point out where development projects have not lived up to Modi's claims. On a recent trip to Ahmedabad, several journalists told Congenoff that Modi has become increasingly vindictive against citizens and journalists who question his claims, prompting self-censorship.*

**Ayurveda prescribes beef for several disorders: Scientist** 

 ______ 
CHENNAI: Ancient Indian scriptures imposed no bar on eating beef and, in fact, ayurvedic Acharya Charaka had recommended beef for some disorders , said veteran scientist P M Bhargava in his letter to President Pranab Mukherjee marking his returning the Padma Bhushan.TOI on October 29 first reported the decision of Bhargava, 87, the founder director of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, to return the award he got in 1986, as a mark of protest against rising intolerance in the country.Quoting Charaka Samhita, Bharagava said: ""The flesh of the cow is beneficial for those suffering from the loss of flesh due to disorders caused by an excess of vayu, rhinitis, irregular fever, dry cough, fatigue, and also in cases of excessive appetite resulting from hard manual labour.""Bhargava said the lynching of Mohamed Akhlaq in Dadri ""probably by fringe elements related to BJP"" showed ""the control that BJP wants to have on what we may eat ... just as it wants to control what we may wear, or whom we may love, or what we may read.""He called the Modi government ""the least knowledgeable"" about science. ""I am a professional scientist with an experience of 65 years. I have also had the occasion of interacting on matters of science with the governments at the Centre since Independence. I find the present government the least knowledgeable and least concerned about science. The climate of religious conservatism that we have today is a major obstacle in the functioning of science and thus in meeting developmental objectives.Bhargava was among the second batch of more than 100 scientists to sign an online petition last month against the ""rejection of reason' that led to the assassinations of scholar M M Kalburgi, rationalist Narendra Dabhoklar and communist Govind Pansare.In his letter to the President dated November 6, made available to TOI, the scientist named BJP and RSS behind the climate of intolerance. ""No one would be more aware than you that, de facto, BJP is the political front of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and functions under the leadership of RSS that is fully committed to the ideology of Hindutva, which I find divisive, unreasonable and unscientific,"" he said.Noting that according to the Constitution, one of the duties of our citizens is to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform, the letter said: ""Steeped in superstition, unreason and irrationality, much of what RSS and BJP do goes against the grain of scientific temper. An example would be the recent statement of Shri Mohan Bhagwat who heads the RSS that marriage is a contract according to which the woman is supposed to be only a housewife and not work outside.""Bhargava said the Padma Bhushan had been very dear to him. ""My returning it to you, for whom I have much respect and admiration, is an expression of my concern at the currently prevailing socio-politico situation in the country.""

**CRPF constable sacked, arrested for social media rant against Modi, Rajnath** 

 ______ 
Police in upper Assam’s Jorhat district on Sunday arrested a Central reserve Police Force (CRPF) constable for allegedly posting derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Rajnath Singh on social media platforms. The CRPF had sacked him a day before his arrest.

Pankaj Mishra, from Ara in Bihar, who was posted at CRPF’s 119 battalion at Rowriah in Jorhat was arrested following a case filed by in Jorhat police station by CRPF sub-inspector Rupram Saikia on behalf of Commandant Balram Behera.

The case has been registered under provisions of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Information Technology (IT) Act for obscene acts in public, criminal intimidation etc.

“Constable Mishra was arrested on Sunday on the basis of objectionable social media posts against the Prime Minister and home minister. He was picked up from CRPF’s camp,” Jorhat deputy superintendant of police Dilip Barua said.

During the past few months Mishra had posted several video clips on a social media platform lambasting Modi, Singh, the NDA government at Centre, CRPF top brass and also the judiciary.

According to the police, Mishra was earlier warned by CRPF authorities to desist from such acts, which were in violation of service rules.

In April, the constable, who was then posted in West Bengal, had posted videos criticizing the government after a relative serving in CRFP reportedly died in a Naxal attack at Sukma in Chattisgarh.

Following the incident, he was transferred to Jorhat.

Mishra was dismissed from his service on Saturday after a CRPF internal probe found him guilty of serious violations of service rules.

Following his arrest, the constable told local journalists that he has done nothing wrong and will continue to highlight problems within the force and in other areas in future.

Mishra was produced in a local court after his arrest and was sent to judicial custody.

That's because administratively Modi was not terrible at all. But he wasn't much improvement either. He was the same as his predecessors (compare the growth figures). Gujarat kept moving along the same trajectory.

So let us take a hypothetical example: With previous CMs 5 flyovers were being built every term. Modi carried this forward. In 12+ years he built 13. Now you see 13 more flyovers, launched with much fanfare. So do you get to experience better roads? Of course. Had there been another CM it would have similarly carried on. ",2017-10-18 14:28:07
466,"More misleading info 

A) 

&gt; Similarly, in the same document, one can analyse where the Gujarat government’s priorities lie. The agricultural subsidies that benefit the farmers have consistently declined since 2006-07. From Rs 195 crore in 2006-07 and Rs 408 crore in 2007-08, it has come down to only Rs 80 crore (revised estimates) in 2016-17.

&gt; Now compare this to subsidies given to the energy and petrochemicals sector, which are run by the Adanis and Ambanis. From Rs 1,873 crore in 2006-07, the subsidies to the sector have dramatically gone up to Rs 4,471 crore (revised estimates) in 2016-17.

Subsidies towards agricultural customers for power is the primary component of subsidies in energy and petrochemicals sectors ([source](http://financedepartment.gujarat.gov.in/Documents/Bud-Eng_667_2016-2-23_460.pdf)). Also, Reliance run oil refineries, not the petro-chemical sector of Gujarat. AFAIK, Adani runs edible oil refineries. PSUs control petro-chemical sector in India - most of Reliance refinery capacity is used for exports.

If you want to check how agriculture is doing in Gujarat, check [growth rates](http://niti.gov.in/content/gsdp-current-prices-percent-growth-2004-05-2014-15)

B) 

&gt; Let me give you two solid examples. In 2007, the year of elections in Gujarat, Modi as chief minister launched with much fanfare the Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana with a declared motive of improving the lives of Adivasis. He set aside Rs 15,000 crore for this scheme, which kicked off with ‘Har ek ko ghar, har ek ko arogya (A house for all, health for all)’. Along with this, he had promised to generate five lakh skilled jobs for Adivasis and construct all-weather roads in Adivasi-dominant areas.

&gt; According to the government’s own data, not even 5% of this has been achieved.

Achievements listed under [Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana](https://dsag.gujarat.gov.in/assets/downloads/vky_achievement_26092016_eng.pdf). The scheme has [10 components](https://vky.gujarat.gov.in/home).

C) 

&gt; I will give you one example of how Gujarat has only favoured the capitalists. The Tata Nano project was brought to Gujarat on Modi’s invitation to the Tatas. The Tatas put a condition that only if the state government gives a loan will it bring the project to the state. The sarkar then opened its doors to incentivise the Nano project. It gave heavy tax relief, cheap land and power subsidies to the project. The Tatas had asked for Rs 33,000 crore as the loan amount. The government sanctioned Rs 11,000 crore at a zero interest rate, to be paid in equal instalments with a moratorium period of 20 years. The Tatas were also given permission to not abide by the state’s employment policy, which mandates that 85% of the workforce must be generated from the region where the factory was set up.

&gt; Despite this, the Nano bombed but the Tatas are enjoying the same incentives at the cost of public exchequer even now.

Though Nano didn't do as well as expected, the Tata factory  is still running and is producing cars other than Nano. It is expected to reach 100% utilization next year.",2017-10-18 14:34:07

Tamil actor Kamal Haasan has apologised for supporting the Centre’s demonetisation drive last November. In a column, titled “A big apology”, that appeared in Tamil magazine Vikatan, Kamal Haasan wrote: “I owe it to the people to apologise for supporting the plan in a hurry.”

The actor stated that there might have been a few problems in its implementation. “Many of my comrades and some people who understand economics called me and criticised me for my views. Later I consoled myself saying that while the plan was good, there may have been some problems with implementation,” he wrote.

Last November, Kalam Haasan joined many celebrities in hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his decision to scrap old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. “Salute Mr. Modi. This move has to be celebrated across political party lines. Most importantly by earnest tax payers,” he had tweeted.

A year after demonetisation, the Opposition claimed that the country’s economy has slowed down. Demonetisation had a negative impact on manufacturing, especially small-scale industries and those in the informal sector, they alleged.

Kamal Hasaan wrote that the sign of a good leader is one who accepts they committed a mistake. “If the PM accepts his mistake without being adamant, then one more salaam is waiting for him from me. The sign of a good leader is when they can rectify their mistakes and more importantly when the can accept they made a mistake. Gandhi was able to do it, today also it is possible.”

It is rumoured that the actor has been looking to enter into active electoral politics. He has been meeting political leaders from cutting across party lines. Recently, AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Haasan at his Chennai residence. Kejriwal said he shares the same ideology as Haasan and hoped the actor would join him in the fight against corruption.

**Who paid for trips Modi made by chartered planes as Gujarat chief minister: Congress** 

 ______ 
The Congress demanded to know who paid for over 100 trips Narendra Modi made by chartered planes across India and abroad when he was the Gujarat chief minister between 2003 and 2007.

Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said the estimated cost of these air travels was around Rs 16.56 crore.

“The nation wants to know, we want to know, as to who paid for these chartered plane travels by Modi. No information has been furnished till date in response to a RTI query made in 2007,” Singhvi said.

Defending Robert Vadra in a case of alleged favour he took from arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, Singhvi said the mails selectively leaked by the government prove nothing against the son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, whereas details of Modi’s travels have been officially sought through the RTI.

Singhvi disclosed, based on RTI revelations, that Modi travelled to Switzerland (July 1, 2007), South Korea (June 16, 2007), Japan (April 15, 2007) and China (November 1, 2006) along with some well-known industrialists and business tycoons.

Waving a picture of Bhandari with civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Singhvi alleged that he was close to Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.

The Congress leader also demanded to know how Bhandari was allowed to flee abroad in December 2016 even though his passport had reportedly been impounded by the government in June that year.

“Who helped Bhandari fly out of the country much like Vijay Mallya? It was not our government in 2016.”

The BJP asked the Congress on Tuesday to explain the alleged links between Robert Vadra and arms dealer Bhandari.

**Opinion: Kerala Hindus No Longer Shy Of Their Identity, Will Turn To BJP** 

 ______ 
The Congress will understandably exult over its huge victory in the Gurdaspur
Lok Sabha by-election in Punjab. Conversely, the BJP will shrug off the defeat
saying its ally Akali Dal's unpopularity, manifest since the assembly
elections, was primarily responsible for its rout in an erstwhile bastion. It
can similarly dismiss its poor showing in Kerala's Vergara Assembly by-poll,
arguing the seat is a Muslim League fortress, which even the Left Front has
not been able to dent. Coming along with the Samajwadi Party youth wing's
victory in the Allahabad University Students' Union election, the last weekend
failed to bring happy tidings for the ruling party.

By-election results usually bring cheer only to the ruling party of the state
concerned, or the party that is already entrenched deeply in a particular area
or seat. To that extent, the BJP need not be unduly worried over its loss of
Gurdaspur or its unimpressive showing in Kerala. But whereas the BJP might
hope to regain Gurdaspur in 2019 when national issues will overtake the
regional, Kerala remains a different kettle of fish. BJP's state leaders must
have hoped for a quantum jump in the party's support after the massive
mobilisation the party attempted in the southern state in recent weeks. The

_Jan Raksha Yatra_

undertaken by the party was perhaps the most ambitious programme ever mounted
in a state which has always by-passed the BJP's electoral net. Party president
Amit Shah spent several days galvanising the cadre and reassuring party
workers in the killing fields of Kannur, To arouse nationwide awareness, BJP
leaders are marching to the CPI(M) headquarters in New Delhi almost daily;
similar demonstrations have been organised in various state capitals too.

Given Kerala's demographic composition, the BJP's aim of making a breakthrough
will not be easily accomplished. But careful strategising would suggest it is
not impossible. Some favourable pointers include the steady decline of the
once-dominant Left-wing parties. The non-Muslim vote may not have fully
consolidated behind the BJP yet as the Vergara result shows, but that's Work
in Progress.

However, there are many ironies in the political culture of Kerala. The RSS is
a powerful force in the state and conducts a massive number of

_shakhas_

especially in its Muslim-dominated northern part. Christians, who account for
nearly 20 percent of the population, do not see eye-to-eye with the Muslim
community, at least electorally. Besides, there are a number of caste-based
Hindu organisations in the state whose political loyalties swing between the
Congress and CPM. In other words, there are many fissures in Kerala society
which ought to provide an entry point to an organised party such as the BJP.

Although Marxist influence has been traditionally strong in Kerala, religious
orthodoxy too is widely prevalent among all its three major religious groups.
Interestingly, the Muslim and Christian communities have for long rallied
around their own political outfits such as the Indian Union Muslim League
(IUML) and Kerala Congress (myriad factions) respectively. But despite the
orthodoxy of their religious leaders, the Hindus have not mobilised around any
one party thus far.

From all accounts, the long-awaited breakthrough for the BJP may now be on the
verge of happening, following its understanding with the Dharma Sansad, a
party allied to the Ezhava community. The most prominent and populous among
Hindu OBCs, the Ezhavas have been traditional supporters of the CPM, although
they always had their own political outfit, namely the SNDP. This coordination
has not yielded dramatic results yet, but a Hindu consolidation is finally
discernible in Kerala.

It is in this background that the BJP has aggressively forayed into the state
under the leadership of Amit Shah, with UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as
its latest mascot. The

_mahant_

of the Gorakhnath Temple in UP never had any particular following outside
eastern UP and adjoining areas of Bihar. But having been catapulted into the
Chief Ministership of India's largest state, the young leader has acquired a
charisma he never had earlier. With the Yogi leading the charge and Amit Shah
strategising the party's manoeuvres, the BJP is poised to emerge as a
significant player in a state where it never had traction in the past.

The question is whether a religion-driven strategy will enable the BJP to
break into the Malayali citadel. But then why not? Both Muslims and Christians
in Kerala are mostly led by orthodox religious organisations. They may like to
call themselves secular parties, but in reality, the IUML and various Kerala
Congress factions are deeply entrenched in religious politics. The IUML
supremo, known as Thangal, controls a huge network of Muslim educational
institutions, just as the powerful and financially robust Syrian Christians
run a web of churches, schools, colleges and hospitals. But apart from the
Ezhavas, Hindus do not have a comparable network nor has there been anything
called ""Hindu"" politics in Kerala so far. Those who say that Kerala is too
well-educated to harbour religiosity as a driver of politics need only to look
at the political formations of non-Hindu groups to realise that education has
little to do with political allegiances.

All these decades, the Congress banked on Hindus and a sizeable number of
Christians to coast to power. The Marxists on the other hand, cultivated an
OBC base and allied with Muslim power brokers in order to perpetuate their
rule. But the mould seems to be finally breaking. Unlike the past, Hindus of
Kerala are no longer ashamed to call themselves political Hindus. In light of
the changed scenario, the BJP under its new aggressive leadership is poised to
emerge as a significant claimant of the political pie. This explains Amit
Shah's

_Jan Raksha Yatra_

and Yogi Adityanath's foray. All the party now lacks is a charismatic local
leader who can supplement the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Kerala and Bengal have eluded the Jana Sangh/BJP's grasp for seven long
decades. But the socio-political structure of Kerala suggests that it may be
easier for the BJP to charge its way into the southern state compared to
Bengal, although it is making a determined effort there too. If the BJP
actively confronts the Marxists in Kannur and pushes them to the back foot and
at the same time, strikes tactical alliances with Christian groups, which see
no long-term future in the Indian National Congress, a new era may well be
dawning for the BJP in Kerala.

**How BJPs outreach is slowly chipping away Oppositions Muslim votebank** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Modi said that his govt will ensure constitutional rights of Muslim women.

2 311 out of the 403 Assembly seats BJP won in UP are dominated by the Muslims.

3 Attracted by former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Shias came closer to the BJP.

The Muslim-Yadav (MY) axis has proved to be a potent force to reckon with in the electoral politics of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. RJD strongman Lalu Prasad Yadav and Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav have reaped benefits of this combination on several occasions, forming governments in their respective states on its basis.

However, the Muslim-Dalit (MD) unity has not been as tried and tested as the MY variant. It has yielded fruits only for BSP supremo Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, that too partially. She had to depend upon other castes such as Brahmins too to register victory.

Despite the failure so far, a concerted effort is afoot from several quarters to establish a solid and lasting combination of MD at the national level. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi is at the forefront of creating such an alignment.

On July 29, 2016, he wrote on a Facebook post with the slogan 'Jai Bheem, Jai Meem': ""Dalit-Muslim unity is the need of the hour to stop oppression and discrimination of Sangh Pariwar. United we stand, divided we fall. No more humiliation! (sic).""

Even earlier, in February 2016, he had pitched for Muslim-Dalit unity, claiming they were the ""two most oppressed communities"". ""We will write a new chapter in the state (UP). The two most oppressed communities - Dalits and Muslims - should join hands on the slogan of Jai Bhim, Jai Meem"", he said while addressing an election rally ahead of the Bikapur Assembly bypoll near Ayodhya.

Be it the Una incident in Gujarat, in which 4 Dalits were brutally assaulted for skinning a dead cow, or Rohith Vemula's suicide in Hyderabad, Muslims had not just condemned these incidents but also stood behind the community. The prospects of a Muslim-Dalit alignment was sought to be explored then too but with little or no success.

However, along with the sincere attempts to create a Muslim-Dalit or Muslim-Yadav axis, another phenomenon of disintegration of Muslims is also taking place. Perhaps to the glee of the BJP, Muslims no more remain a monolithic and cohesive entity.

Either on its own or catalysed by the BJP, the fragmentation of Muslims - who make up 14.2 per cent of the country's population as per the 2011 census - is taking place. It poses a challenge to the MY or MD axis in the future.

SHIAS

Indian Shias, constituting about 25 per cent of the entire Muslim population of India, see themselves different from the Sunnis, who make up the majority. They are considered to be forward-looking and modern as compared with the Sunnis.

Attracted by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Shias came closer to the BJP. Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the only Muslim to hold a Cabinet rank in Narendra Modi's ministry, is a Shia.

The Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board has announced that it would gift 10 silver arrows as a mark of respect for the construction of the Lord Ram statue in Ayodhya. The arrows are for Lord Ram's quiver, board's chairman Waseem Rizvi said.

The Board has also welcomed the Yogi Adityanath government's move to build a 100-metre-high statue of Lord Ram on the banks of Saryu river in Ayodhya. ""UP government's decision to erect a statue of Lord Ram is commendable. In keeping with the Ganga-Jamuni 'tehzeeb' of Awadh, these silver arrows will be just a token of admiration and esteem in which Shias hold Lord Ram"", he said.

Shias have always venerated Hindu gods and goddesses. For instance, Rizvi said the Nawabs of Awadh donated land for temples in Ayodhya.

The land for Hanuman Garhi in central Ayodhya was donated by Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah in 1739, while the funds to construct the Hanuman Garhi temple were provided by Nawab Asif-ud-Daullah, between 1775 and 1793, he said.

Shias have jumped into the ongoing Taj Mahal controversy too. Rizvi said the monument cannot be a symbol of ""worship."" He also alleged that ""most Mughals were 'aiyaash' (dissolute)"".

As the Mughals were Sunnis, the Shias are seen to be opposing them and, in the process, aligning with the likes of BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who said Taj Mahal is a blot on Indian culture.

Besides, the Shia Board is one of the parties in the appeals pending in the Supreme Court regarding the Babri Mosque-Ram Janmbhoomi Temple dispute. In August, the Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that the Babri Masjid site was its property and only it was entitled to hold negotiations for an amicable settlement of the dispute.

It also said a mosque could be built in a Muslim- dominated area at a reasonable distance from the disputed site in Ayodhya.

Efforts to create a monolithic Muslim community have been severely jolted with the stands which the Shias have been taking from time to time.

WOMEN

It is believed that a majority of the 50 per cent of the Muslim population has supported Modi. This section constitutes the Muslim women.

Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election earlier this year, Modi's exhortations that the government would ensure that the constitutional rights of Muslim women were protected struck a chord with the Muslim women. He was obviously referring to the polygamy and triple talaq practices prevalent among the Muslims.

The women of India's largest minority community are believed to have overwhelmingly voted for the BJP in UP. No wonder, the BJP won 311 of the 403 Assembly seats in UP. Out of these 311 seats, 100 are dominated by the Muslims, including Deoband, where the community makes up for 71 per cent of the population.

The women even got relief when in August, the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq, terming it unconstitutional. Modi's continued engagement with the Muslim women may make it difficult for Owaisi to create a cohesive block of the minority community.

BOHRAS

Bohra Muslims, who are primarily settled in Gujarat, are also considered to be different from the Sunnis and closer to the Shias. This community is predominantly engaged in business and, hence, is generally peace-loving.

As any unrest, disturbance or riots adversely affect their trade and business, the Bohras always support peace and harmony in society. They are generally considered Modi and BJP supporters in Gujarat.

SUNNIS

With Muslim women, Shias and Bohras tilting towards the BJP, Owaisi and his ilk may have to bank upon the men among the Sunnis to create an MD alignment against the BJP and Modi government. Half of the Sunnis, who constitute about 70 per cent of the Muslims in India, will have to be aligned with the Dalits, making up for 16 per cent of the population to take on the BJP.

Together, they make up for roughly 23 (7+16) per cent of the population. With this combination, Owaisi or anyone trying to create an MD alignment is unlikely to taste success. Moreover, with the BJP's outreach, a monolithic Muslim votebank is also getting chipped off.
