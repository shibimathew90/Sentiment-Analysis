Tharoor has very cleverly set himself up as the moderate face who can swing between the nationalist crowd, the hindutva crowd(increasing number of religious posts or pics of him doing pooja), and the liberal junta (fighting for homosexual rights). There are Tharoor fan clubs popping up similar to the NaMo clubs to push the narrative of Tharoor and create his personality cult.

10,"Alright, I've watched the whole 37 minutes of it, and here are some thoughts - 

1. Doesn't address the removal of money donation limit removal at all. Skips around the issue (at 30 min mark). 

2. Also doesn't address the excessive power granted to the raiding authority. He addresses the positive change though, that is - the whistle blower's identity will now no longer have to be revealed to the target of the raid.

3. Says that demonitization, the finance bill, and all other steps are taken to make the tax evaders accountable. 

4. Aadhar link made compulsory because ""there have been cases where people use 5 or more PAN cards to evade tax"". Counter point raised was that aadhar is equally susceptible to fraud. Answer - it is not. Biometrics makes it safe. 

Overall, couple of things - 

1. the government is highly dismissive of any criticism. The passive aggressive way in which Jaitley brushes off the opposition can hardly be considered constructive. He comes off as almost arrogant - like 'lol teri aukaat kya hai mujhe yeh poochne ki?' 

2. However, it has seems to have its goals clear - tax collection is a priority, by hook or by crook. The means will justify the ends. But there seems to be a laser like focus on collecting tax as much as possible. It's not a haphazard, poorly thought out strategy. Lot of thinking seems to be behind this. 

3. What I don't understand, is why this had to be a money bill that is sure to be passed by the LS, instead of a proper bill that has to be ratified by both the houses. It reeks of backhand techniques to skirt the opposition. No matter how good your intentions may seem to you, democratic ways still need to be followed. 

4. The ruling party has its goals clear, its vision clear for what it wants India to be. And it will do whatever it takes to get it done, including bypassing democratic checks and balances in place. Whether it's good or bad - the jury is still out. I have a feeling though that BJP supporters like BJP and NaMo precisely because of this. They are more than willing to sacrifice personal civil rights if that ensures 'things get done' and it is 'for the nation'. 

5. There is no strong opposition right now. That's the saddest, most worissome thing for a democracy. A strong opposition is must, but our opposition trying to be the opposition is like a retarded clown given the responsibility of solving algebra problems.

13,"&gt;We have treated Muslims well for nearly 7 decades save for a few slip ups which were **nowhere near the level of persecution faced by Hindus and other minorities in Pakistan** especially right after Independence 

Yeah lower the bar to the lowest level possible and then claim that your treatment is spectacular.

Ever tried getting renting a house as a Muslim in the so called ""cosmopolitan"" cities of India? 

In Gujarat you cannot even buy a house in various areas depending on your religion unless the govt. okays it. So even if a muslim family  wants to move out and integrate with others, the govt. blocks them.

&gt;Hinduism extended all the away to Afghanistan but Muslims from the Middle East came and committed genocide after genocide over centuries and left us with less than half our land. 

Hinduism didn't extend all the way to Afghanistan by showering lotus petals all over the place. Hindu rulers too fought wars and killed people and destroyed temples. Because that's how conquests and wars happened in that era. You had to destroy your enemy and if a certain temple was considered to be a source of protection of the enemy that too had to be destroyed. Because people were ignorant as fuck in those times and believed in a lot more supernatural bullshit than people do today.

As far as 

&gt;""left us with less than half our land"". 

Who the fuck declared that some piece of this planet belonged to anyone? Early humans originated in Africa so anyone living anywhere else isn't a native but an immigrant. 

There was no religion when the planet was formed. There was no religion when life came into being. There was no religion even when early man came into existence. There was tons of tribal religions with their own customs/rituals/deities.. which were slowly wiped out by wars and conquests and intermingling of tribes. 

Just because there's no written record of that part of human history.... doesn't mean it didn't happen or you can choose your own convenient starting point of human history to suit your bigoted agenda.

&gt;This is not about war or peace, it's about peace turning into legal immigration which is what happened in Europe and what almost happened in the US. Europe as you can see is in utter turmoil and Sweden is almost beyond saving.

Ah you mean just like how the white Europeans ""legally""  killed the native peoples of North  and South America and that of Australia while ""preserving"" their superior gene pool?

And also spread their ""culture"" and ""religion"" to the rest of the world in the name of uplifttment and betterment. Why are you wearing shirts and pants and underwear which are cultural imports and not our native culture at all? 

As a Trump supporter if you are anti-immigration, then all white americans should first sail back to Europe and leave the whole contintent to Native Americans. As should all the african americans and Asians and Indians. But the Hindu bigots who attend Namo and Trump rallies in US feel they are somehow more entitled to live in the US.

If you really want to give India to back to it's original cultural roots then you should give up all your ""modern"" Hindu crap and force everyone to be follow ancient tribal customs and worship their deities.

But no you don't want that. You don't want to change a single thing about you. But you want to eliminate everything that is unlike you because of some crap about ""originality"" and ""purity that you cooked up to cover up your bigotry and hatred for your fellow humans.

14,"1. MPs and MLA should have basic education. 
2. Nutral laws. Nothing specific for men or women. When you put more weight on one side, you have to put the same weight on the other side too. Unless it will come down.
3. Cap on tenure of PM, MLAs and MPs. Preferably 10-15 years. 
4. Ministers should be MP or MLA for minimum of 5 years to hold the post. Their age should be below 50. Else, they and their mentality will be aloof from the current generation.
5. Discard all laws that are constituted before Independence and constitute new one that will be fit for next 20 years. 
6. Post to be held should be declared before the election, just like what America do for presidential election. 
7. Govt should not be allowed to get away from court ordered. If there is a court order concerning any specific case, the only way the government can dodge it should be through another court order. The court should be convinced that all loop holes are filled through their own procedures. And, the number of judges should be more than the previous bench.
8. Any order made for public should be first applicable to ministers, MPs and MLAs. If any of them fail, they should be dismissed from the post and debarred from election unless they take a special oath after public apology. Show us your finger before you get your salary Mr.RG and NaMo. (Oh I see, you already do that a lot)
9. A way to call back MPs and MLAs.
10. Privacy should be a fundamental right.
11. Government should not ask caste, religion or gender.
12. J&amp;K should be open to every Indian. 
13. FUP in reservation. Use it during education or job and only once in your life. Till PUC, education should be free to all.
14. If govt want to ban something, like liquor, there should be a referendum. 
15. If any institution is making money from any source other than charity, they should not be non profitable. Charity should come within tax threshold. 
16. Censorship board should be scraped. But, there should be a body to (only) certify whether a movie or ad is fit for certain age group. 
17. Practice of attestation should be ceased. Copy of any government document should be valid anywhere and their validity should be supported digital.
18. All application should be paperless. If the govt is worried that date will be lost, there is no need of a IT ministry, Ministry of industry or IT law. 
19. Calling for bandh or strike should be a criminal act. But demonstration, protest and summoning of minister, MP or MLA should be allowed. 
20. No age restriction for government post. Lateral entry should be stopped. But, lateral exam should be allowed. 
21. Laws regarding ration card, priority, non-priority should be practical. A lot of poor one posses undeclared assets. There should be a consolidated digital data at Panchayat level regarding land and property. Anything asset that is not connected with a ration card should be added to the public asset.
22. What is this concept of women constituency? I am seeing elected one sitting at home and her non elected hubby is ruling the constituency. 
23. Law governing the responsible usage of public property. A passenger in a train should be responsible for the things he use while his journey. If something is damaged, the passenger should be summoned just like in the case of traffic violation. 
24. Abolish the concept of gender role. Paternity leave should be treated equal to maternity leave.
25. Government official should take another exam after a specific period to prove that they are competent and deserve to hold the post.  
26. Laws and act should be in simple language. ELI5.
27. Polluting should be criminal offense. 
28. Define secularism and religion. The definition should be fit for all context. 
29. Abolish the post of town planner. What the heck is he doing anyway!
30. Laws to protect whistle-blowers. Anonymous complaint should be treated as valid. If it is financially not possible, make a ""I love your work bond"" to support this. ",2017-03-30 20:21:04

20,"I'm trying to understand the legality of the situation, so please bear with me here why I think out loud.

Regardless of his alleged actions/intent, he is not guilty until proven in a court of law, a right afforded to him by our constitution. Let's assume a random person files a defamation/libel or any other kind of case against the Prime Minister of India. If that case goes to court, the PM will be of course given an option to be represented by a lawyer. I don't know how this works, but I suspect that PM already has a government paid lawyer for such issues. If there isn't one or if the PM wants a ""better"" one, there is likely a provision in the legislation for him to procure the services of a private lawyer with the PMO's budget. Unless it can be shown/proven *before* the case goes to court that the case is against *NaMo the Indian citizen* and nothing to do with *NaMo the PM*, I think he will be represented by a taxpayer funded lawyer. I am not sure how one proves/disproves something like that legally, or if there is even any provision for it. Can a randian lawyer chime in? NaMo has had several cases against him in Gujarat as a CM, I know that. Maybe someone has relevant information on this.

If I am not utterly wrong about this, then regardless of our hatred of Kejru's shenanigans he may well be within legal rights as a CM to procure legal help at a cost to the taxpayer.

**Edit**: seems like I misunderstood how exactly this case was filed. According to another poster Jaitley is paying out of pocket, so it's already classified as a private civil suit. As long as Kejru's activity/stature as a CM are not brought into this case to argue for or against, then his office is technically not involved in this. As a side note, we of course know it is impossible to fully divorce the political ramifications from this case.",2017-04-06 06:22:05

&gt;Sri Sri, 60, had said he should be given an award for organising the event. His organization said today that ""we left the site in better condition than we found it"" and that it is will take its case to the Supreme Court.

&gt;The opening of the event was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though President Pranab Mukherjee dropped out after the controversy over environmental clearances erupted.

Fucking lol. The next time anyone tells you that AoL is doing wonders for people's lives, and how it changed their lives, show them this. The next time people admire NaMo for his 'eco friendly' policies, the next time reddit gets flooded with India's 'solar power' initiative, show them this.
