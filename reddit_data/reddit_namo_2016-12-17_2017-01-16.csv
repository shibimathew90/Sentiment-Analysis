1,"&gt;I am not an active follower of politics (state and national ), but this government is worse . I mean you make any criticism then you are anti national. Always bringing in army, our ""ancient culture"", lots of agendas even for movie censorship, stuff like that. 


Are you anti-BJP or anti-BJP supporters? 

&gt;Thought UPA was very liberal. They didn't give any shit. You could make all those funny MMS Singham videos, Italy reference,RaGa jokes etc. 


You seem to think governance is about taking jokes and being jolly. Well you're wrong, congress didn't ever enjoy the kind of popularity that NAMO had. I'm pretty sure if Rahul Gandhi is as popular as NAMO you would get backlash for making jokes about him. To give you context you can make jokes on Gadkari right now without people giving you shit even though he's a senior minister. The reason being he's not popular among masses, at least not on a national scale.

&gt;Except for that 2G scam....


You're kidding right? correct me if I'm wrong but you're line argument is that ""My government might be corrupt but I won't care as long as they can take a joke"". If that is you're thinking then I'm sorry you're retarded.

2,"Honestly, you're probably right. Pappu is no match for Modi's political clout. None of the other veterans of Indian politics are big on the national stage. The only way we can save ourselves from another term with the BJP is if the UPA manages to hold everybody together under some sort of seat-sharing scheme. Lalu as PM for one year, Nitish for another, Didi for third, Karunanidhi for fourth and maybe Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi for fifth.

A more likely scenario is that Modi does not relinquish power, declares Emergency and throws all Opposition into prison. In that case there will be wide-spread loot and riot by Sanghis. Maybe even war led by right-wing Hindus against moderate Hindus and non-Hindus, like Gujarat experienced during the 2002 Muslim massacre. The Aadhaar database should come in handy for the NaMo Army in such a situation. It's no wonder that Modi is so intent of forcing everyone to get an Aadhaar card. It's also scary that Modi has promoted his lapdog into the post of Army Chief, disqualifying senior and more capable officers because they are more loyal to India than the BJP.

Time after time, when we met for coffee, during our dating phase, she told me about how bigoted the RSS ideology was and how Modi was a criminal for his activities in Gujrat. I said nothing. I just sipped my mochaccino and smiled at her. Among our friends, there was a tacit agreement that we were both liberals. We got married one month before demonitization.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

THE Indian Food Processing and Beverages Industry experts have maintained that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious Make in India initiative has immensely boosted the prospects of Indian food processing and beverages industry. It has opened up a plethora of unique opportunities for entrepreneurs and businessmen, including foreign investors, to foray in the lucrative Indian food processing sector poised to witness more than double digit growth in the near future, they said.

The experts were addressing a well attended conclave on “Food Processing Industry: Opportunities and Challenges” as a part of 6th Food and Bev Tech 2016 organised by the premiere Confederation of Indian Industry (Western Region) at Hyatt Regency Convention Centre recently. The focus of the conference and exhibition was aimed at promoting the Indian food processing industry at global scale.

Piruz Khambatta — chairman, Food and Bev Tech 2016 and chairman, Rasna Private Ltd — said the industry was steering ahead due to rapid advances being made in the field of information technology and international best practices being incorporated as a part of expertise introduced by the companies. Stressing the need for the growth of the sector, he said, “A developed food processing industry will reduce wastages, ensure more value addition and generate additional employment opportunities. Besides, export earnings will increase and it will lead to better socio-economic condition of farmers and their families.”

He added that an expansion in the food processing industry would increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of agricultural sector in return.

Surakshit Khadya Abhiyan chairman, S Dave, in his special address harped on the importance of food as an important ingredient which he said has to be accounted for in the value chain of food processing.

Ashwini Malhotra — co-chairman, Food and Bev Tech 2016 and MD, Weikfield Foods Pvt Ltd — said traditional farming must give way to organic farming. He added that tremendous opportunities were opening in the field of manufacturing organic products.

If you are someone who takes the respectable media seriously, you may have thought, or still think, that Narendra Modi has committed a huge blunder by delegitimising large notes, and that it would destroy him because most of India is furious. There have been reports of the poor losing jobs and of people dying in queues outside banks. Every time a rustic man committed suicide, it was relayed to us as a “farmer suicide”, of course, and the reason this time was not his disenchantment with genetically modified seeds (that spin has run its course) or drought (the season has changed), but cash crunch.There was a bit of exaggeration in the coverage because drama is an old friend of human-interest stories but most of the tales of misery were true. They are still trickling in. Yet there is evidence that the average Indian feels Modi is on to something. Or at least, for some reason, he is not angry with Modi. If the cash crunch continues for another month, the mood might change but as of now it does appear that Modi is going to be fine. The people standing in the queues suggest that. Even small traders, who are very important to Modi in some states, say that. One of them, in a newspaper interview, said that the trading community is hardwired to go with the flow and not against the flow. BJP has not been punished in the by-polls or civic elections that were held in several states after the demonetisation. In fact, the party fared well in seven states. And, there has not been a single incidence of rioting even though the political foes of Modi appeared to contemplate the prospect somewhat fondly.

What is going on, and what does it say about India?Most of the poor seem to believe that the rich have been affected more than them. Cash is a powerful cultural symbol of wealth, hence the perceived fiefdom of the rich. Anarchy in the cash economy, their reasoning goes, would hurt the rich more. That is a significant political sentiment. It is a persistent and under-reported phenomenon across the world that the poor tend to hate the rich more than they hate their politicians. This is true even when the politicians themselves are rich and the rich, at least the refined rich, make so many sweet gestures.

This is true even when the politicians themselves are rich and the rich, at least the refined rich, make so many sweet gestures.Also, in the perception of the majority, such an extraordinary monetary shock has a ring of righteousness about it. Another factor that has favoured Modi for now is the fact that the current misery of the poor, which seems so severe to the middle classes, is only slightly worse than their regular problems. They queue up often for many things, return empty-handed, queue up again, and go for days without employment or money.

In the southern states, there is a cautious wonderment — never has a Prime Minister directly affected their lives as Modi has with this measure.

By his own admission, the implementation was a screw-up. He said so in an interview on Thursday. He said that demonetisation as a policy (apparently to clean up the economy) “is unequivocally clear, unwavering and categorical.” But the strategies to implement it could have been better, he said. One of the political strategies to absorb the shock though has worked – the impression that he is going to wire the money that he has robbed from the rich into the bank accounts of the poor.

But, the average Indian often appears to wait for the urban sophisticate to reveal his learned opinion so that he can feel the exact opposite emotion.

Can the now reduce the tax.

Congress can actually run an election campaign using NaMo and his Minister's statement but then there political acumen is zero.",2017-01-01 21:26:34

TMC Govt in WB, despite its (wrong) Leftist image, has been going full-steam in shutting down PSUs and laying off PSU employees despite protests by Trade Unions:

PSUs can be privatized rather than shut down. If the private employer wants to lay somebody off, so be it. 

And the excess employees in PSUs can easily be transferred to other Govt departments, thereby also saving new recruitment costs for other Govt departments.

NaMo is just afraid of the PSU lobby.",2017-01-12 17:33:28

On a day when Ex-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh predicted the “worse is yet to come” for Indian economy after demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s maverick move received a thumbs-up from the World Bank. Speaking at ‘Jan Vedana’ conclave on demonetisation organised by Congress party in New Delhi on Wednesday, Singh dubbed demonetisation as a “disaster” and predicted things were going from bad to worse. “Demonetisation has hurt the country. Things have gone from bad to worse, but the worse is yet to come,” he said.

Singh slammed PM Modi’s claim that economic situation is improving after demonetisation. He said the claim was “hollow” and “Modi’s propaganda”. “We now know the beginning of the end has come.” In his brief address, the former PM reiterated what he had said in Rajya Sabha last month, quoting “some rating agencies” that the GDP could slow down to 6.6

In his brief address, the former PM reiterated what he had said in Rajya Sabha last month, quoting “some rating agencies” that GDP could slow down to 6.6 per cent due to demonetisation. However, a World Bank report released on Wednesday said otherwise.

The first such report after the announcement of demonetisation on November 8, 2016, appears to be in agreement with PM Modi’s claim that demonetisation is “short-term pain for long-term gain.”

“A benefit of ‘demonetization’ in the medium term may be liquidity expansion in the banking system, helping to lower lending rates and lift economic activity,” the report said while forecasting India’s growth as “still robust”. It said growth in India is estimated to reach 7.0 percent in the financial year ending on March, 31 2017. This is a reduced estimate from the previous 7.6 per cent growth forecast for this year.

Acknowledging the short-term disruption caused by demonetisation, the report said, “In the short-term, demonetisation could continue to disrupt business and household economic activities, weighing on growth. Further, the challenges encountered in phasing out large currency notes and replacing them with new ones may pose risks to the pace of other economic reforms (e.g., Goods and Services Tax, labour, and land reforms).”

The report predicted that growth in India would regain its momentum “with growth rising to 7.6 percent in the financial year 2018 and strengthening to 7.8 per cent in the financial year 2019.”

The report also said that reform activities taken by Modi government would “unlock domestic supply bottlenecks and raise productivity.” Such as: a) infrastructure spending would improve business climate and attract investment in the near-term. b) “Make in India” campaign may support the country’s manufacturing sector, backed by domestic demand and further regulatory reforms. c) Moderate inflation and a pay hike as per 7th Pay Commission recommendations would support real incomes and consumption.

Regarding RaGa v NaMo, I honestly don't know. His interview with each went quite differently. I stopped watching them long ago, so I'll have to take your word for it.

But the fact that Congress boycotts them, and AAP too boycotted them for some time leads me to believe that they have some pro-BJP bias. That has been my observation too. Of course, I have my own biases, so I can't judge it effectively.",2017-01-13 23:14:06
