**Sex racket busted in MP, NaMo Brigade head among 4 held** 

 ______ 
At a time when BJP is attacking AAP over sacked Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar‚Äôs MMS scandal, an alleged sex racket was busted in Madhya Pradesh with the arrest of four people, including a man who reportedly operated ‚ÄòNarendra Modi Army Brigade‚Äô.

Police booked the four people for human trafficking and also under provisions of Immoral Traffic. (Prevention) Act. A local court sent the four to 14-day judicial custody.

On Sunday, police raided a beauty saloon at Sachin Tendulkar Marg in Gwalior district, 330 km from Bhopal, on Sunday and busted the alleged sex racket being run by Rajesh Agrawal. The four, including a woman manager, a receptionist and a customer identified as Vikas alias Tinu Jain, were arrested from the spot. Jain is said to operate ‚ÄòNarendra Modi Army Brigade‚Äô.

Jain who was allegedly caught in a compromising state with a woman tried to intimidate the police by claiming to be a member of the BJP‚Äôs youth wing Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM).

Police found Jain flaunted his picture with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on his Facebook account. Jain is also seen with Railways minister Suresh Prabhu and Gwalior MP and union minister Narendra Singh Tomar on his Facebook profile.

The BJP was quick to refute about Jain having any link with the BJP or any of its allied outfits. ‚ÄúHe is not at all related to our party,‚Äù Gwalior district BJP president Devesh Sharma said. ‚ÄúAnyone can get his pictures snapped with political biggies.‚Äù

City SP Maharajpura, Vinayak Verma said primary investigations revealed that Jain, a wealthy private contractor, was a customer at the saloon. ‚ÄúSeveral incriminating things were seized from the spot. We probed his alleged links with the BJP, but the probe is yet to establish it,‚Äù Verma said.

Interestingly, Jain in last status update the FB page on Sunday posted: ‚ÄúMai jaisa bhi hoon samne khada hoon, mujhe kuch chupabe ki aadat nahi.‚Äù (I am present despite whatever I am, I am not in a habit of hiding anything).

Investigation revealed that the racket sourced poor girls from Nagaland on the pretext of giving them job of beauticians, but were forced into massage and sex trade. ‚ÄúAt least five women aged between 20-22 years (all hailing from Nagaland) were brought to Gwalior. One of the women was sent to Nagaland, while the other four will soon return to their state,‚Äù Verma added.

There is nothing in media or medium that can distract or divert my vote and support for NaMo, the greatest leader of 21st century India. 

Anyone who sees the side effects and not the target of his decisions is by definition (to me off course) willfully ignorant, doesn't comprehend the issues at stake or just plain anti-national. But it doesn't matter, for the majority of well meaning Indians know that the distractions that come in the form of kongi nonsense or pointless/endless media ranting or social-sociopaths are not going to stop them from voting for this man again and again and again well beyond 2019. 

Its funny how as his 3rd anniversary of being in power just passed all the concerned citizenry is out there slinging mud to his good work. 

Now, to the answer to your question is simple. He himself would have to be involved in corrupt acts to loose my vote. I will give you that. But something tells me about this man it would be hard to get him to be corrupt. Good luck with that. 

Comparing him to donalD trumP is just plain stupid. You have to be an imbecile.

27,"**Her knees and nerve: Why PeeCee thought she was doing the PM a good turn üòú**
- Radhika Vaz

Priyanka Chopra has some nerve. A self-made woman, she has gone where no Khan or Kapoor (male or female versions) is ever likely to go. She makes bank, blazes trails and looks awesome doing it. You would think that is enough attention for one person. But no, Priyanka Chopra wanted more. So what did she do? Well, last week she wore a dress that showed her knees to a meeting with the PM! What? I know, right! Who does that? Who behaves in such a disrespectful and distasteful manner? A modern woman ‚Äì that‚Äôs who. And good reader, these girls have to be taken down immediately.

The reason i say this is because independence and self-sufficiency are like the plague when put in the hands of the wrong gender. Women are meant to stay covered and quiet. Not like in Saudi Arabia of course ‚Äì no, no ‚Äì we Indians would never, ever do that to our girls. We are a progressive lot. But knees! Let me compose myself.

As if to add insult to injury Priyanka not only showed her knees but half way through the conversation with the PM had the guts to cross her legs! Some guy called Gulzar Hussain spoke my mind when he said that girls should only cross their legs when in the presence of their boyfriends. Wait. Boyfriends?! This man is too westernised. I was on his side when he completely sexualised how a woman sits. But ‚Ä¶ Boyfriends?!

If you know me then you know that the one thing i am against is a dress. As a seedhi-saadhi desi lady i prefer the sari, a costume i have found that if draped correctly will show off my full stomach, back as well as the size, shape and circumference of both breasts. With this option why did PeeCee have to go Hollywood? Good reader, i may have an answer. This deluded yet incredibly successful woman probably did not mean to be disrespectful, in fact i think PeeCee thought she was doing the PM a good turn. Think about it, all this time the only knees that NaMo has had forced up on him have been those of his RSS buddies. Doesn‚Äôt he ‚Äì of all people ‚Äì deserve some reprieve?

What about UPA-1? you conveniently gloss over the fact that the country is in a much worse state that is was in UPA-1 or even the first 2 years of UPA-2

&gt;&gt;you have become breeding ground for these massive trolls who stoop down to name RaGa as the future of the country.

And you leave out the conservative ""trolls"" that beat (sometimes to death) people for criticising the ruling party and and their ideologies. Funny how the government won't call them terrorists but a Muslim eating a steak is a terrorist.

BJP IT Cell is a part of a much wider BJP propaganda machine that also has large amounts of shares in a lot of mainstream Indian news stations and threaten newspapers with pulling government ads from them. (For an example, take a look at how Arnab Goswami went from being an actual newscaster to a Fox News level parrot for the government).

The fuck is going on? *reads article*

*comes back*: Hoo boy, mid way through, and this deserves its own expansion. 

First - 

&gt; Good politics begins with accepting that DeMo did not work. Hiding the truth can hurt Modi more than acknowledging it ‚Äì directly or indirectly

Good stuff. Credit where credit is due.

&gt;But DeMo is his ultimate test. If he learns from this, his next two years may still be his best.

Ahh well -expected. If the author went 180 and started targetting NAMO, it would have been bizarre.

&gt;The critics have been right for the wrong reasons. They did not have a better crystal ball on DeMo‚Äôs side-effects than the optimists; but they did have a deeper animus against the Narendra Modi government that the optimists, including me, did not have. 


Hoo boy, damning with faint praise. Yet it must really fucking hurt to say that the opposition was right. So I'd personally give it a pass.

I will however correct his position - The people I read, and the people I spoke to, never said DEMO was bad because of NAMO.

DEMO was bad because of DEMO, the reasons behind it, the execution of the event, the timing of it, the subsequent reversals, dodges, ambiguities, bad policy (remember inking fingers?), denials - were a crap show.

But in *defense* of DEMO - I personally did not see the signals I was expecting immediately in the news. 

----

&gt;In late November 2016, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) had estimated the loss to the economy and various players at Rs 1.28 lakh crore. Since then we have had more data on GDP losses in the two quarters immediately affected by DeMo. If we assume that at least 0.5 per cent of the GDP drop was due to DeMo, the CMIE loss figure would at least double.

&gt;But now we have the unstoppable juggernaut of farm loan waivers: UP (Rs 36,000 crore-plus), Maharashtra (Rs 30,000 crore-plus), and Chhattisgarh (Rs 3,200 crore of interest waivers) have already taken the loss to state exchequers close to Rs 70,000 crore, and we haven‚Äôt even begun. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch estimates that the total size of loan waivers could hit Rs 2.57 lakh crore by 2019. They note in a research report: ‚ÄúWe grow more confident of our call that farm loan waivers will spread across states after Maharashtra followed Uttar Pradesh in waiving farm loans on Saturday (10 June). This begs the question, how much of farm loans will eventually get waived? $40 billion, or 2 per cent of GDP, in our view, in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. This covers bank loans to farmers with up to five acres of land.‚Äù

Mother of Gawd, may the Monsoons be awesome.
