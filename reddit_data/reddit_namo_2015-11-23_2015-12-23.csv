1,I'm not supporting Raga but NaMo was not joking in front of the doctors. He sincerely believes that our ancient doctors could attach elephant's head to an infant and they had knowledge of genetics and nuclear physics. But I don't blame him. Majority of our population believes this shit. Even my own family and friends :),2015-11-27 17:01:53

15,"Fun part was, Namo army won in the end as their leader got a majority in loksabha elections, so butthurt remains permanent for some people here. ",2015-12-09 13:03:52
16,"As the name suggests supporters of NaMo (self made or BJP PR or mix) used /r/namoarmy as a base to vote brigade (manipulate the votes; so these guys will heavily upvote +ve posts and downvote -ve posts) on /r/india threads.

This troll guy ""pm_4_modi"" (i don't remember clearly) used to post like a (ultra?) right wing person and thus was recruited by /r/namoarmy. Only this guys took screenshots of the conversations in the mod mail of /r/namoarmy and outed them. As it was proved by those screenshots that /r/namoarmy is involved in vote brigading, the admins banned them.

One could only wonder if any new groups sprouted up in place of /r/namoarmy.

What do the folks at /r/achedin do?

What do you think is JantaKaReporter is?
Tweet them any thing wrong AK does, they will modify it and present it in 180 degree news from original.







Accounts like Aggressive AAP, Degree Dikhao PM sahab, Susu,Swach Politics - are all filled with abuses and nude Namo photos.

They have no logic and are the ones who say NaMo as Hijada territorials.
Those are the same people who abuse the BJP on homosexual law not passing.


 The language AK used the other day, his followers actually deserve the thrashing.
