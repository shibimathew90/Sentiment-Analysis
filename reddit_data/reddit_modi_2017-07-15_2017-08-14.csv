3,"Law and order is a state subject. The centre has limited powers to investigate anything that happens in a state.

This is why the UPA at the centre couldn't take any action against Modi for his role in the Gujarat riots. And the judiciary had to step in. There is still a lot to be uncovered.

Amit Shah as home minister manipulated a lot of cases against himself and Modi. There were lot of corruption accusation against Modi that have never been investigated. A Congress government in Gujarat will be a nightmare for them. ",2017-07-15 01:49:21

**FIR against AIBs Tanmay Bhat: Is India going the North Korea way? Wheres the tolerance?** 

 ______ 
When in 2015, Bollywood's King Khan -- Shah Rukh Khan -- said that there is rising intolerance in India during an interview, he was slammed by the online lynch mob and asked to go to Pakistan. A few months later, Bollywood's other superstar Khan -- Aamir Khan -- said that there is a sense of rising despondency in India and that he was shocked when his wife -- Kiran Rao -- wondered if they should move out of the country due to this, he was severely criticised too.

Today, an FIR has been filed against comedy group AIB's co-founder Tanmay Bhat after a meme, that offended many, was tweeted from the group's official Twitter handle day before yesterday. A photo of a man who resembles Prime Minister Narendra Modi had gone viral on social media platforms. The man, wearing a trouser and a T-shirt, is looking into his phone at a railway station.

AIB went a step ahead and created a meme using the above image on one side and creating a new image that intended to show what the man was doing on his phone. They imagined him using Snapchat and checking out a dog filter.

The meme that was posted from AIB's verified social media handles didn't go down well with a lot of people and, quite obviously, began the trolling, mostly from the right-wingers who cannot bear a word against Narendra Modi. AIB chose to delete the meme seeing many didn't like the joke. What followed? Trolling, this time from Congress supporters and spokespersons stating that the comedy group never deleted any posts that was directed at the Congress Party.

Tanmay Bhat had the best response to both parties.

When someone pointed out to Tanmay that American comedian Jon Stewart stands by the jokes he make, how much ever controversial, Tanmay reminded him about the truth of today's India. Tanmay said that he is not Jon Stewart and that he is not living in the United States of America, a land where a stand-up comedian -- Hasan Minhaj -- could make jokes about Donald Trump, the President of America, during a White House Correspondents' Dinner.

The fellow was sensible enough to understand where the decision to delete the meme came from.

But do we understand it?

How difficult is it to understand that making a joke is Tanmay's freedom, just like it is yours. Deleting something he posted is again his call. Disliking the joke, not agreeing to the joke is your freedom. Letting Tanmay know you are not pleased with the joke is your freedom. You can unfollow him on social media, unsubscribe from AIB's YouTube channels, but you DO NOT have the right to threaten him.

IS INDIA STILL A DEMOCRACY?

Is Narendra Modi India's king?

Isn't he an elected leader? If Rahul Gandhi could be made fun of, the same is applicable to Modi.

How is making a joke about Narendra Modi hurting the national sentiment? Why are we as a society oblivious to the fact that there are millions of Indians who do not approve of the prime minister and his functioning. The same goes for Rahul Gandhi or any other politician for that matter. But can that justify harassing and threatening anyone who's joking about a prominent leader?

If you are raging reading this, you are part of the problem. Your admiration for a particular leader, be it anyone, doesn't oblige others to respect them or agree with them. India's democratic fabric should be upheld and if you think you cannot stand jokes on your favourite leader, you are just proving Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan right.

YOU ARE INTOLERANT.

THE ONLINE TROLL ARMY

It's old news that all political parties use and misuse social media platforms. From spreading fake news to propagate religious hatred to resorting to character assassination of people who choose to speak about the uncomfortable truths to harassing and threatening journalists who raise tough questions, the troll army of all parties make social media platforms a horrible place to be at.

Propaganda is peddled with the help of fake accounts that could be easily made on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter and nationwide trends are created to lead people into believing that many on respective platforms care about certain issues, when in reality, they don't.

In this digital age, with so much data available about people active on social media, it is easy to threaten anyone and silence them. These eggheads (lingo for fake Twitter profiles) could be seen deactivating their accounts and running for their lives the moment official Twitter handles of police are tagged.

THE FIR

Reetesh Maheshwari, who has written ""Nation First, Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikaas, Mission 2019, Namo Phir Se"" in his Twitter bio, tweeted what translates to, ""Strct action should be taken against Tanmay Bhat for ridiculing the Prime Minister of India"" and tagged the Mumbai Police's official handle.

The Mumbai Police handle replied within minutes saying, ""Thank you for bringing this to our notice. We are forwarding this to the cyber police station.""

And an FIR was registered against Tanmay Bhat this morning.

In the defence of Mumbai Police Cyber Cell, if a complaint is filed against someone, they will have to do their job and register and FIR.

IRONY

Video jockey and standup comedian Jose Covaco tweeted this today.

Stabbing irony in its eye is an incident from a couple of days ago. A woman, who had to catch an early morning train from Mumbai's CST railway station, faced the horror of a stranger masturbating looking at her, she called a policeman for help. Instead of helping the woman, the cop did nothing and asked the woman to go sit somewhere else.

Question here is, what is the bigger issue? Womens' safety or some harmless memes?

Responding to a tweet asking his views about the FIR against Tanmay, Jose said...

After responding to many on Twitter, Tanmay ended the discussion once and for all, reminding everyone what the prime minister had once tweeted.

Highlights 1 AIB used the picture of a Modi lookalike and superimposed the dog filter onto it.

2 Modi's call for humour had come in response to a Twitter user.

3 Mumbai Police registered an FIR against AIB over the meme.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself called for more humour in public life. That was the reminder that All India Bakchod's (AIB) Tanmay Bhat posted on Twitter on Thursday after their meme on Modi went viral, was criticised, and promptly taken down by the comic group.

""We surely need more humour in public life,"" Modi had posted on Twitter on March 17 following the BJP's stunning victory in the Uttar Pradesh election.

Modi's call for humour had come in a response to a Twitter user called Sir Rajan, who applauded the Prime Minister for his tongue-in-cheek reply to a post by former cricketer Ravi Shastri.

""Wow! I hope you use your sense of humor (sic) extensively in every speech,"" Sir Rajan had told Modi after the latter retweeted Shastri's congratulatory message.

""Thank you. UP polls did not quite go down to the wire. But, at the end of the day democracy is indeed the real winner! :)"" Modi had posted in his reply to Shastri.

Shastri's tweet, that started it all, went like this: ""Congratulations @BJP4India on the landslide win in UP. The pair of PM @narendramodi &amp; @AmitShah went past 300-mark like a #TracerBullet""

The All India Bakchod group is in trouble following the Mumbai Police's Cyber Cell registering a First Information Report (FIR) against the comedy group for tweeting a Modi meme using the Snapchat dog filter.

The AIB used the picture of a Modi lookalike at a train station and superimposed the dog filter onto PM Modi's picture.

The picture, captioned #wanderlust, was subsequently deleted after the AIB was bombarded with criticism and accused of insulting Modi and ""hurting the national sentiment"".

**Stable economy, reforms make India a safe bet: Mark Weinberger, Chairman, EY** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: India is one of the top investment destinations in the world right now thanks to a stable economy and low inflation besides reforms like the goods and services tax (GST) and new insolvency rules, said EY chairman Mark Weinberger . Demonetisation, which was initially seen acting as a brake on growth, will help rein in corruption and encourage the shift to a cashless economy, he added.“It’s got a 7% growth rate, stable government, good macroeconomic indicators like low inflation and deficits under control, plus it’s got massive reforms aimed at the right direction,” he said in an interview. “In other emerging markets, you have swings in commodity prices, you have Venezuela and Brazil running through difficulties, Brexit will have its own effect. There are difficult decisions to be made in the world but when you look at where to put money, India constantly comes out as one of the safe bets.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy change agenda is responsible for altering the global view on the country’s prospects.“There is no doubt that PM Modi is changing the attitude of India towards opening the economy to the rest of the world,” Weinberger said. “His government is trying to put in place reforms that will broadly improve the Indian economy and that means from infrastructure investment to reaching out to rural population to create more wealth to things like putting in a GST tax structure, which is monumental.Then, things like the bankruptcy law to deal with non-performing assets — a whole bunch of things that hadn’t been done for years.” To be sure, India still ranks high on the list of places that are difficult to do business in, he said.“But the reforms have just taken place and it takes years for them to be actually executed well,” the EY chairman said. Demonetisation “was a bold and courageous move to deal with corruption,” he said.

VISHWA HINDU Parishad (VHP) chief Pravin Togadia on Thursday accused the Intelligence Bureau (IB) of “snooping” on the organisation’s members and “harassing” them. In a letter to the IB director, with copies marked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Togadia equated the situation with the Emergency era.

He wrote, “We were saddened and shocked to hear and see the Central IB officers questioning VHP, India Health Line &amp; Hindu Help Line volunteers at various places.” India Health Line and Hindu Help Line are VHP initiatives to help the needy in medical and other emergencies.

The VHP chief alleged that IB officers are “pushing” volunteers to give details of how they “operate, who are the people associated with these organisations”. “This,” he wrote, “is horrible, and resembles (the) Emergency time.” He also sought “immediate apology from the Central IB and from the Ministry under which it works”. The IB is under the Union Home Ministry. About Togadia’s letter, a senior ministry official said, “We have not received the letter. We will take cognizance as it comes to our notice.”

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A bullet train in the future would cut down travel time between Delhi and Varanasi - a distance of 720 km - from the present 12 hours, to just 2 hours and 37 minutes.The project connecting the holy city - Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Modi - with national capital is a priority for the ruling BJP dispensation.When operational, travel from Delhi to Lucknow (440 km) will take just one hour and 38 minutes.A Spanish firm M/s INECO-TYPSA-ICT which was doing feasibility study of the project, which is part of Delhi-Kolkata high-speed corridor (1474.5 km) has submitted the draft final report to high-speed rail corporation and railway board on Thursday.According to the report, the fare of Rs 4.5/km was considered as base fare which means travel between Delhi to Lucknow will cost at least Rs 1,980 and Delhi to Varanasi will cost around Rs 3,240.The project will be the third high-speed project at different stages of conception and execution.The construction on Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor will start in September this year while the Mumbai-Nagpur stretch is on advance stage of getting approvals.As per the report, if the project starts in 2021, the Delhi-Lucknow stretch will be operational by 2029 while Delhi-Varanasi stretch will be functional by 2031.The Delhi-Varanasi stretch will pass through Greater Noida, Aligarh, Lucknow, Sultanpur and Jaunpur. The station at Jaunpur was not part of earlier plan, but was added after lobbying by the area MP Krishna Pratap Singh who argued that the stoppage will ensure development of the backward region of eastern UP.The report has proposed the main terminal in Delhi near Akshardham Temple. The preliminary cost, without rolling stock, being worked out is estimated to be about Rs 52,680 crore for the Delhi-Varanasi stretch of 720km and around Rs 1.21 lakh crore for the entire Delhi-Kolkata corridor of 1474.5km.A railway official said the report was discussed by the railway board on Thursday and changes which were suggested will be incorporated. He added that the alignment has been designed for maximum operational speed of 300 km/h, in order to meet a commercial speed of 250 km/h.

**India gets G20 praise on start-up funding, labour reforms, ease of doing business** 

 ______ 
Hamburg: Acknowledging steps being taken by India for sustainable and inclusive growth as well as support to global economy, the G20 has praised the initiatives in the country for promoting ease of doing business, start-up funding and labour reforms.

In its Hamburg Action Plan, adopted at the G20 Summit of leaders from the world’s 20 largest economies, the group also noted that “in the financial sector, India is popularising a number of derivative instruments in exchanges or electronic trading platforms” as part of measures to enhance resilience of its economy.

More From Livemint »

It further said India is facilitating external commercial borrowings (ECBs) by start-ups in order to encourage innovation and promote ease of doing business, as part of the efforts being taken by the G20 members this year for maintaining momentum on structural reforms and sustainable growth.

On steps being taken by G20 countries for promoting inclusive growth this year, the Action Plan said India is introducing labour market reforms to provide security to workers, increase female participation in the workforce and make doing business easier in the country.

The acknowledgement from the G20 Summit, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi among other world leaders, assumes significance in the wake of India trying hard to improve its global ranking for ease of doing business.

The World Bank ranked the country at a low 130th position last year, an improvement of just one position from the previous year. The Modi government has said it wants India to be ranked in the top-50 nations in terms of ease of doing business. The next update to the ranking is expected later this year.

The areas where India ranks poorly as per the World Bank ranking include starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency.

The country has implemented a spate of reforms in the recent months in areas like insolvency, taxation and starting a business and expects the rankings to improve substantially. The acknowledgement of various reform measures by G20, whose members include 19 countries and the European Union, has come as the latest boost to hopes for better ranking for India in terms of ease of doing business.

Global institutions like the World Bank, IMF, WTO, OECD, ILO, WHO and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) are among the partners to the G20. G20 member countries include the US, UK, Germany, India, Australia, Japan, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Indonesia, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey.

The G20 Hamburg Action Plan, which sets out the group’s strategy for achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, also said that the closer partnership and action by G20 members will boost confidence and contribute to shared prosperity. It said the Action Plan has been developed against a backdrop of improving growth and job prospects.

“The global economic recovery is progressing and gaining momentum. Investment has picked up, and trade and manufacturing are showing signs of recovery. However, the pace of this growth is still weaker than desirable, and downside risks remain. Weak productivity growth, income inequality and ageing populations represent challenges to growth in the longer term,” the G20 Action Plan noted.

It included new policy actions to tackle challenges in economies, focusing on initiatives that foster inclusive growth, enhancing resilience and further the G20 efforts to implement structural reforms. In the action plan, the G20 members resolved that they will continue to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively to achieve the goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, while enhancing economic and financial resilience.

The members committed to use their fiscal position flexibly and in growth-friendly way to prioritise high-quality investment, and support reforms, while ensuring debt as a share of GDP is on a sustainable path. They also reinforced their commitment to structural reform and acknowledged that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.

The G20 leaders also committed to refrain from competitive devaluations and said they will not target their exchange rates for competitive purposes. The Action Plan also outlined new actions to tackle the issues of beneficial ownership, correspondent banking and remittances, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, fossil fuel subsidies and data gaps.

The G20 leaders said their growth strategies—individually and collectively—will boost global growth, including an increase of an additional 2% for the G20 collective GDP by the next year. The 13-page action plan took note of various steps being taken by the member countries including on monetary policy and enhancing resilience of the respective economies.

It also said China is improving its business environment and utilising foreign investment actively, while the European Union is fostering investment with a proposal to extend the European Investment Plan and increasing the overall flexibility of the EU budget to support job creation, investment and economic growth.

On promoting inclusive growth, the Action Plan noted that the inequality within many countries had increased until the mid-2000s and the member countries are introducing further measures this year to promote inclusive growth and raise the living standards of all their citizens.

It also said that the malicious use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) could disrupt financial services crucial to both national and international financial systems, undermine security and confidence and endanger financial stability.

On taxation, it said the G20 will continue to work for a globally fair and modern international tax system and welcome international cooperation on pro-growth tax policies. It also called on all jurisdictions to sign and ratify the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.

Terming the multilateral convention as an important tool in fight against corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing and money laundering, the G20 said it will advance the effective implementation of the international standards on transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements.

**Samajwadi Party a divided house again. This time over choice of presidential nominee** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Meira Kumar met Akhilesh and BSP chief Mayawati on Friday to seek votes.

2 BJP has selected a strong candidate in Kovind, it has a majority: Mulayam.

3 We pledge open support to Kovind, said Shivpal's loyalist Deepak Mishra.

On the choice of support for presidential election nominees, the Samajwadi Party is a divided house once again.

While on the one hand party chief Akhilesh Yadav has asked his MLAs to vote for Opposition candidate Meira Kumar, on the other, party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his brother Shivpal Yadav are likely to back NDA's nominee Ram Nath Kovind.

The differences have surfaced months after infighting in the Samajwadi Party top brass between former Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal eventually led to the removal of Mulayam from the post of the party's national president in January. While Mulayam threw his weight behind brother Shivpal, Akhilesh got the support of uncle Ram Gopal Yadav.

Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said, ""Akhilesh Yadav had instructed party MLAs to vote for Kumar.""

The former Lok Sabha Speaker, during a day's visit to Lucknow on Friday, met Akhilesh at the party office before meeting BSP supremo Mayawati to seek votes.

AKHILESH FACTION BACKS MEIRA KUMAR

""Meira Kumar visited the Samajwadi Party headquarters and met Akhilesh and SP MLAs to seek their support. Akhilesh has asked SP MLAs to vote for Kumar,"" Chaudhary said.

Another Samajwadi Party leader and leader of opposition in Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Ram Govind Chaudhary said, ""Everyone should support Kumar.""

Meanwhile, Shivpal's loyalist Deepak Mishra, though not a voter, said, ""We pledge open support to Kovind"".

He thanked Prime Minister Modi for his selection.

Mulayam's vote for Kovind became a foregone conclusion the very day he openly described him as a ""strong candidate"".

KOVIND IS A GOOD CANDIDATE: MULAYAM

""Ram Nath Kovind is a good candidate. I have a very old relation with him. BJP has selected a strong candidate. The most important thing is that the BJP has a majority"", Mulayam had said last month.

Shivpal, too, had said that he would do as advised by his brother.

""Netaji (Mulayam) jo kahenge wahi hoga"" (Whatever netaji says will happen)"", he said.

During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's last visit to Lucknow on June 20, Mulayam had met him at a dinner hosted by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, sending clear signals that he would back the NDA nominee.

Significantly, the dinner was skipped by Akhilesh and Mayawati, who are supporting the Opposition's candidate.

We have discussed this before, but neither of us budged.




&gt; I am not sure you know what's an oligopoly



Airlines have significant barriers to entry, and depending on the route, there can be very limited competition. Plus, the main issue with luggage charges is that it's a post-ticket situation, and the opportunity for predatory pricing is significant. There are no alternatives and the information isn't particularly transparent or upfront.




&gt; They made a lot of new laws are around it.




Which party started cow politics in India? This is a societal issue in India. I don't support the beef ban, but I understand the stance of both sides on the issue.




&gt; Modi increased service tax from 12% to 15% even pre-GST. And with GST increased it to 18%



Some things increased, and some things decreased or became exempt.




&gt; Free Wifi at railway stations



That's basic infrastructure. If the government is running railways, then they can very well spend on providing wifi at stations. I support privatising them though, but till then they can pay for the wifi.

Neither do you know it's malice. It's a simple mistake, taking millions as crores. In contrast, labelling the Bengal kid as a ""Hindutva agent"" stinks of narrative shaping. Similarly, the media houses and blogs labelling the Noida mob of Bangladeshis who ransacked the apartment as ""Jihadis"" also stinks of narrative shaping. 



&gt; this is a delibrate attempt to push their agenda and nothing else. 




What agenda does this serve? Will people now vote for Modi because he has 43 crore likes, instead of 4.3 crores? Which election are they aiming to influence?



&gt; And by making excuses for this, you are unwittingly supporting them.

You are talking about GST and I don't agree with you on that.

**Odisha: Man thrashed, woman molested after they stopped men from beating cattle** 

 ______ 
A software engineer, Kanan, along with his wife and her two friends were brutally assaulted by a mob of armed meat mafia goons on Friday evening.

""It was about 4pm on Friday when all four of us were sightseeing in village Khedapoda, Chandili when we saw some gangster like men armed with sticks and knives, severely beating cattle,"" said Kanan, who took videos and clicked pictures of the distressed animals before dialling the #100 number for police and senior officials of the locality including SP Rahul. The police, however, did not come to the site.

""With no response from the police and SP Rahul, we tried reasoning with the goons ourselves. Little did we know, that they would attack us with the same sticks and axes with which they were beating the animals. I was attacked while my wife was molested by these barbarians. They snatched and smashed my phone which had all recordings. It's a miracle we are still alive. Seeing the lawlessness here, would not like to come back to Odisha,"" Kanan, elaborated further.

Kanan is undergoing treatment. A case has been filed in Chandili Police Station, but no arrests have been made for the assault and no cattle have been seized till now.

SP Rahul evaded India Today's calls and was not available for a comment.

Sources revealed that 1000's of cattle are smuggled for slaughter on foot from Odisha to Andhra Pradesh through the vast rainforest cover in Odisha on a weekly basis. This is the same belt where Kanan and his wife and friends were attacked. This is not the first case of growing lawlessness in Odisha, where criminals are at large and police is missing in action.

RECENT CASES OF ATTACKS

- Earlier this week, in Odisha's Raigada district, animal activists informed police of several hundred cattle being smuggled on foot through the Chandili rainforest area in the middle of the night (with photographs and videos for proof). On arriving at the spot, the police official from Chandili Police was seen ushering cattle smugglers to hide the animals and no case was filed on the grounds that no cattle were found. India Today has access to photographs and videos to prove that cattle were indeed being taken on foot and audio recordings of police officials saying that no cattle were found on the spot.

- Recently, animal lovers Teertho and Niranjan, were pelted with stones and beaten with sticks by meat mafia goons for visiting and clicking photographs at an animal fair, in Kaalapatthar, Beguniya district of Odisha. Niranjan was wounded on the head while Teertho was severely attacked and his wallet, phone and passport were stolen.

- Shifting focus to Karanataka, Thimaraju, an AWBI officer, was thrashed by a mob of meat mafia goons last month, in the presence of police officials, for bringing to light the workings of an illegal slaughter house in Channarayapatna, Hassan district. ""I went for a visit with police officials to the illegal slaughterhouse where we found hoards of calves locked inside a small room. On releasing the animals, we were returning towards the PCR van when I heard a mob of butchers chasing me and surprisingly no police officer was there in sight for my protection. I was hit on the head and thrashed in front of the Police PCR van. The police had conveniently vanished for those few minutes.""

This is a brief list of recent cases of attacks by meat mafia goons on tourists, animal lovers, AWBI officers and genuine gau rakshaks. In the above cases, even when police was informed of illegalities in their jurisdiction, no action was taken indicating a strong nexus between the police and the rampant meat-mafia in India which does not spare women or tourists.

Couple more and they might name the country after him.

**Government Asks Businesses To Register Under GST By July 30** 

 ______ 
Businesses with turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh are exempt from GST. (File)

**New Delhi: **

The government on Saturday asked traders to get registered under the Goods and
Services Tax (GST) regime by July 30. However, traders with turnover of below
Rs 20 lakh or those engaged exclusively in the supply of exempted goods or
services need not register under the new tax regime which has kicked in from
July 1.

""As per the GST laws, one is required to take registration on or before July
30, 2017. All traders are requested to register now without waiting for the
last date,"" a finance ministry statement said.

Listing the benefits of getting registered under GST, the ministry said that
input tax credit can be passed on in the value chain and due taxes collected
will come to the exchequer.

""Therefore, traders are requested to register under GST immediately without
wasting any more time,"" it said.

Businesses with turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh (Rs 10 lakh in special category
states) are exempt from GST.

""If one is carrying out any business and has an annual aggregate turnover in
the preceding financial year exceeding Rs 20 lakh, you need to register in all
the states/Union Territories from where you are making taxable supplies,"" it
said.

Excise, VAT or service tax payers who have already migrated to the GSTN portal
and have been issued provisional IDs need to complete the registration process
by September 22, 2017, by giving all the documents following which GSTIN will
be issued.

Those taxpayers who need not register under the GST regime can cancel their
registration by July 22. Those who have not migrated but are liable for
registration will have to do so by July 22, it added.

For new taxpayers who are not registered under any of the erstwhile tax
regimes, they will have to get themselves registered by July 30.

If anytime during the course of the financial year a business crosses the Rs
20 lakh turnover threshold, then it will have to apply for registration within
30 days from becoming liable for registration.

The finance ministry said if a business has a valid PAN, email ID and a mobile
number, then it can file an online application on the common portal
https://www.gst.gov.in/ and get registered for GST.

""Taking registration in GST is a very simple process, and the comfort of the
taxpayer has been kept in mind while designing the procedure,"" the statement
said.

The ministry said that getting registered under GST is for one's own benefit
and if one is liable to take registration but does not get registered, one
will not be able to enjoy the benefit of input tax credit.

Any registered person purchasing from him/her may not be able to get the input
tax credit. Besides, not obtaining registration, though liable to do so, would
also attract penalty, it added.

""Getting registered would lead to growth in one's business. Prospective
buyers, who are registered under GST, will prefer to buy from suppliers who
are also registered under GST, as this would entitle them to the input tax
credit,"" the ministry said.

Getting registered would mean that one is contributing his bit towards nation
building by ensuring that appropriate taxes are collected and paid to the
government, it added.

Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked all chief
secretaries to work expeditiously towards ensuring that all traders register
under the GST regime.

He conveyed this while chairing a meeting of Pro-Active Governance and Timely
Implementation (PRAGATI), a multi-modal platform through which he interacts
with top officials of state governments via tele-conferencing.

**14 years in jail if you kill cow, 2 if you kill people: Judge in BMW case** 

 ______ 
When a Delhi judge sentenced the son of a Haryana-based industrialist to two years’ imprisonment on Saturday for mowing down a motorcyclist with his luxury car in 2008, he couldn’t help but observe how present-day laws provide more stringent punishment to perpetrators of cattle-related crimes than errant drivers who take human lives.

“The sentence for killing cow is five, seven or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,” additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar said.

The court held the accused, 30-year-old Utsav Bhasin, guilty of rash driving, voluntarily causing hurt on provocation and causing death by negligence. It also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh for the injured.

On the night of September 11, 2008, Bhasin – then a BBA student – had crushed Anuj Chauhan and his friend, Mrigank Srivastava, under his BMW car at Moolchand in South Delhi. While Chauhan died in a city hospital, Srivastava survived the accident. Bhasin was arrested from ISBT Kashmere Gate while he was fleeing to Chandigarh.

Though the court had passed the verdict in May, the quantum of punishment was pronounced only on Saturday. It also granted statutory bail to Bhasin, enabling him to file an appeal in the high court. The bail bond was fixed at Rs 50,000 with surety of a similar amount.

Bhasin was earlier cleared of culpable homicide, which provides for a maximum jail term of up to 10 years.

The court said a copy of the judgment must be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he can consider steps to enhance the punishment prescribed for such offences under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The judge also quoted a song from the movie Jindagi aur Toofan – which goes ‘Aadmi chahe toh taqdeer badal sakte hai, poori duniya ki woh tasveer badal sakte hai, aadmi soch toh le uska irada kya hai (Humankind can change its fate if it wants to, can change the entire picture of the world if it wants to, as long as there is a strong resolve to do so)’ – to buttress his point.

The court noted that India has a “disreputable record of road accidents”, with a total of 4.64 lakh road accidents being reported in 2015 alone.

128,"&gt; In the melee, a question remained unanswered, raised by the Trinamool parliamentarians. **Had the Hindu boy posted *that blasphemous photo* on Facebook of his own free will**? Or had been coerced or duped into it. Did he personally do it? Did someone else have access to his Facebook.
  
Is this a question that warrants asking in this day and age? The guy could have done whatever he did for any number of reasons. I'm not certain why people get provoked by an image on the internet. Certain things *are* offensive, no doubt, but that leap from ""I'm offended"" to ""I'm offended, so I'm going to riot"" is quite giant and it seems to be getting normalized in India.  
  
As usual I'm going to lay out my usual diatribe about how India needs better cops. Better cops would arrest everyone, throw them all in jail and punish them all. The reason why offended people riot and get away with it is because there's no consequence to their rioting - in fact India has become so weird that the rioting is a consequence of something harmless. I don't think itst supposed to be this topsy turvy.  
  
&gt; Finally, Bashirhat, 100 km from Kolkata. At College More, burnt remains of a motorcycle in the middle of the road. Not a soul in sight. Who did it? When? A man peeps down from a roof. ""It was burnt an hour ago,"" he whispers. Who by? I ask. ""We Hindus,"" he says. ""The Muslim driver ran away. But our backs are to the wall. **We have to hit back**.""
   
This is the kind of nonsense that happens when we have politicians and not leaders.

They (Muslims -- the word is not used, mostly) can get away with anything and we are labeled ""BJP"" if we resist?

&gt; A teacher who said I could use his name, Ganesh Ghosh, makes the most profound comment of all. ""I condemn the post on Facebook. But just because one Hindu boy has shown disrespect to the Prophet, does that mean we Hindus are all showing disrespect to Him? Just because one Muslim terrorist kills 20 people somewhere, do we say all Muslims are terrorists?""  
  
I would say theres a little validity in that. And yes, all Muslims are absolutely called terrorists when a guy blows himself up. I've literally seen this as a defense used on Facebook news pages comment sections about that stupid AIB meme fiasco. ""Muslims riot and can try to kill a Hindu boy in jail but we can't be angry about Modi being made into a dog??""  
  
Reading this whole thing has told me something is broken in India and its not 100% the result of actions of the right wing. We can all sit on /r/india and preach to high heavens about how to behave, but ground level realities show that it doesn't take a lot to cause fissures between Muslims and Hindus. At best there seems to be an uncomfortable peace between the two communities. That's not a very optimistic picture at all.

Sycophants to the Dynasty can't hold more power than the Dynasty. That's pretty obvious. Even MMS was a puppet and had way less power than Modi, despite being in the same official position.



&gt; There was no such cult following of them like it is of modi. 



Irrelevant to our discussion. Did Modi personally decide to crack down on Tanmay and memes as the current narrative is attempting to suggest? Or was this an overzealous police caption, launching an FIR? For all we know, this could be a false flag operation to begin the next phase of ""intolerance"" in the virtual world. All the hypocrites from TMC's Derek O'Brien to Congress' Shashi Tharoor have begun their spin and take on the situation, but were unsurprisingly silent when their own regimes, whether Mamata's in Bengal or SoGa's at the Centre were much more harsh on memes and more pro-censorship.",2017-07-16 11:18:04

That's my main issue. All this entire incident suggests is that some officer at the Mumbai police department was way too overzealous and decided to launch an FIR on AIB again. Keep in mind, this also happened during their Roast, as well as Tanmay's trolling of Sachin and Lata. But did anything happen after? The outrage died down, and nothing happened. This is standard procedure in India. Like it or now, our country's citizens have an incredibly thin skin and get outraged at the drop of a hat. Where does Modi come into this?

That's where I differ with you. In the AIB case, the action was that of Mumbai police, several steps removed from Modi. In the Sibal case, *he personally* took steps to curb FoE. 

It simply is not possible for this to be more on anybody than on Sibal, due to the simple principle that everyone is more in control of their own actions than the actions of other people (even direct reportees, which the Mumbai Police isn't). 

And it's important to clarify at this point - I am not saying Modi is innocent here. He should fix the problems with FoE and enshrine it as an inviolable right (unlike the hopelessly hobbled one it is today), and just like every single one of his predecessors, he will not do so.

**Modi govt does not deserve the flak it got for Raghuram Rajan’s exit from RBI** 

 ______ 
Most people consider me a critic or, at least, not a supporter of the Modi government. I wouldn’t quarrel with either description. However, I also see myself as an objective and balanced journalist who is duty bound to be fair. In a moment, you’ll understand why I have begun this way.

Two facts, which have come to my attention in recent days, could change the way the media and, indeed, the wider public have viewed the Modi government’s handling of the governorship of the Reserve Bank of India. The prevailing perception is that the government was unfair and ungrateful in denying Raghuram Rajan a second term. Some have even argued he was pushed out. There are also a few who criticised the government for not offering the job to Rakesh Mohan, a former deputy governor, who many thought was the best candidate available.

I hardly need to stress how much flak the government has received for its alleged treatment of Raghuram Rajan. The alleged ignoring of Rakesh Mohan didn’t receive the same level of attention but the cognoscenti were outspoken in their criticism. Well, it seems, on both counts the obloquy was unfair and wrong.

Unimpeachable sources have told me that Mr Rajan was offered a two-year extension. However, the problem was his inability to get a further extension of leave of absence from Chicago University without losing his valuable tenure. Mr Rajan could only stay on for eight additional months.

Quite understandably, the government decided this would be inadequate. It would only add to the uncertainty at the top of the Reserve Bank. It, therefore, opted to choose a new governor.

Seen in this light, it’s clear Mr Rajan was not badly treated and the criticism the government faced on this count was mistaken and unfair. Furthermore, these details were known to a few people but never fully reported, although they were clearly hinted at in an interview Mr Rajan gave the New York Times last September. As the paper put it: “He said that his departure was based on his inability to reach an agreement with the government on serving longer but not serving another full 3 year term.”

Let’s now come to Rakesh Mohan. I’ve very reliably learnt he was approached for the governorship and the government was extremely keen that he accept. Unfortunately, a personal and poignant problem prevented him from responding positively. It would be improper to go into further details but what I can confirm is that he requested the government not to be considered even though this meant a post he would have regarded as the culmination of his career had to be gracefully declined.

However, what I can add is that the government tried its best to find ways of enabling Mr Mohan to accept. Sadly, that wasn’t possible. So, once again, criticism that Mr Mohan was overlooked is both mistaken and unfair.

I’ve recounted these facts both because they reveal the government in a very different light to what many have so far assumed and because I was one of the many critics of its handling of Messrs Rajan and Mohan.

Today I’ve lightened my conscience by sharing these details. However, there’s a lot that this government has done and said that I remain critical of. There’s no U-turn in my overall attitude. But fairness requires I give the government its due. In these two instances its critics and opponents were wrong. I’m making no comment about anything else.

**Fifth Column: Musings from a Modi bhakt** 

 ______ 
A recent survey by Forbes magazine found that 73 per cent of Indians trust the Modi government. (Reuters photo) A recent survey by Forbes magazine found that 73 per cent of Indians trust the Modi government. (Reuters photo)

We do not need foreigners to confirm that Narendra Modi remains very popular. The results from Uttar Pradesh confirmed this already. But, for what it is worth, a recent survey by Forbes magazine puts India at the top of countries with ‘the most confidence/trust in their government’. The survey found that 73 per cent of Indians trust the Modi government. If a similar survey were done in newspaper offices and TV studios, the result would have been very different. It is true that there are a handful of ‘nationalistic’ news channels today that believe criticism of the Prime Minister amounts to treason, but by and large my fellow travellers in hackdom continue to despise Modi. I know this because of the taunting that I routinely face for being a ‘Modi bhakt’.

My strenuous opposition to cow vigilantes hunting and killing Muslims has caused me to be abused viciously on Twitter by other Modi bhakts, but in media circles I am seen as a supporter of Modi. It is true that in this column I have often shown support for certain things he has done. I totally support the abolition of the Planning Commission, the Swachh Bharat and Beti Bachao programmes. I totally support the Prime Minister’s emphasis on planned urbanisation and the recognition that India is not going to be primarily rural much longer. But, the real reason for my support is that politically I am a conservative and economically right wing. I believe India could have been the richest country in the world if we had not been held back by Nehruvian socialism. In my view, the economic reforms done by P V Narasimha Rao and Dr Manmohan Singh in the early Nineties brought the only real prosperity India has ever seen.

So when candidate Modi talked of withdrawing the State from business and giving us ‘more governance and less government’, it was music to my ears. I had hoped that by this midway point in his term, the Prime Minister would have delivered on those promises. Air India should not just have been sold long ago but officials responsible for building up losses of nearly Rs 50,000 crore should be named and punished. If Vijay Mallya can be punished for not paying up Rs 9,000 crore, then why should Air India officials not be punished too?

If the Prime Minister meant what he said about government not having any business to be in business, then we should by now have at least seen government hotels sold. In Delhi alone there are at least three government hotels that are decaying before our eyes, and they sit on some of the most expensive real estate in India. The three are the Akbar, the Centaur and the Samrat. The NITI Aayog is said to have drawn up a list of public sector companies that need to be got rid of, so why have we seen so little action?

On the ‘more governance, less government’ front we have seen the opposite happen. BJP chief ministers have led the charge by snooping into people’s kitchens to see what kind of meat was being cooked and by making such a noise about cows that it is surprising there has not been more vigilantism in the name of our holy cows. Beef hysteria whipped up this way resulted not just in shameful lynchings, but the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in industries related to cattle. Traditional animal fairs like the one held for centuries in Pushkar will probably not survive for long. The worst of it is that the industries threatened with closure employ very poor people.

The Prime Minister routinely urges overseas Indians to come back and invest in making in India. And there has been much hullabaloo about government-sponsored entrepreneurship programmes. They have not worked because governments cannot create entrepreneurs. Indians are among the most enterprising people in the world and for decades they have been held down by socialist policies that give officials the power to interfere in the minutiae of running businesses. The reason why overseas Indians have not flocked back to invest in the homeland and why Indian businessmen are not investing either is because the atmosphere is not as ‘business-friendly’ as the Prime Minister appears to believe it is.

Meanwhile, we have seen such an explosion of cultural conservatism that it is making India look quite ridiculous. The recent effort by the Censor Board to snip words out of a documentary on Amartya Sen is an example of this. So if the Censor Board and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting were abolished in one fell swoop, it would send an important message. These are relics of socialist times when officials behaved like thought policemen. There are other government departments that deserve the chop and the sooner this happens the more real governance there might be.

It should be led by a person wth integrity. I have two choices, BJD leader Navin Patnaik &amp; JDU leader Nitish Kumar. Both of them have led a long public life with integrity. 

However, the principal opposition party in the coalition will be Congress with largest vote &amp; seat share. So they would want to head United Front. I know their are many credible young faces in Congress too like Schindia, Pilot, Tharoor, Kamalnath etc. But if Congress stuck with Rahul Gandhi, it won't work. it will be suicide.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today warned those breaking the law in the name of cow protection and asked the states to take stringent action against them, but cautioned against giving political or communal colour to the issue.""All (state) governments should take stringent action against those who are violating law in the name of cow protection,"" Modi said at an all-party meeting a day before the Monsoon Session, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar told reporters here.The Prime Minister also underlined the belief of many Hindus that cow is like mother, but said that this should not let people take law in their own hands and every state government should act against violation of the law, Kumar said after the meeting.Opposition parties have attacked the BJP over the cases of cow vigilantism , in which Muslims and Dalits have often been targeted. These parties have also planned to raise the issue during the Parliament session starting tomorrow.Modi also mentioned the presidential poll to be held tomorrow and said it would have been very good had a consensus been reached on the candidate.He, however, said ""high level of dignity"" has been maintained by both sides during the campaign and no ""ill will or bad language"" has been used.He said all political parties must ensure that everybody votes and no vote is wasted.While the ruling BJP-led NDA has named Ram Nath Kovind as its candidate, the Congress-led group of opposition parties has pitted Meira Kumar against Kovind, who has a big numerical advantage over his rival.Modi also appeared to be taking a dig at RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is facing fresh corruption charges, as he sought cooperation in fight against corruption.People involved in corruption should not be saved, he said at the meeting, adding that the image of a political leader has taken a beating because of this.Kumar said Modi also noted that the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement falls on August 9 and all parties should celebrate it.Modi also thanked everyone for the implementation of the GST, calling it a ""shining example of co-operative federalism"".He told the all-party meeting that 30 per cent of total expenditure and 49 per cent of spending in the infrastructure sector had already taken place before the monsoon started due to the advancement of the budget.On the issue of Kashmir and tensions with China, Kumar said the government had a meeting with opposition leaders and every party has said they were with the government on matters of national security.Among those opposition leaders who attended the meeting were Ghulam Nabi Azad (Congress), Sharad Pawar (NCP), Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP) and D Raja (CPI).However, no one from the JD(U) or the Trinamool Congress were present. TMC has already announced it would boycott this meeting amidst recriminations between it and the BJP over the recent violence in West Bengal.

174,I too defend right to express freely but not at the cost of some innocent man. Using free speech to put your point is perfectly okay. What I am against in this incident that he used an innocent man's photo to troll PM Modi. He couldn't used the photo of Modi cause that whom he wanted to target. Why drag an innocent man in this who is probably now upset cause of misusing his picture and now under mental trauma to cut his beard.,2017-07-16 16:28:47
175,"&gt;Modi today warned those breaking the law in the name of cow protection and asked the states to take stringent action against them, 

Finally he's asking state government to take action! After umpteen number of people pointing out that as  PM he cant appeal to criminals by saying Gandhi 
will not approve but by taking action against them!
&gt;**but cautioned against giving political or communal colour to the issue.** 


All your BUTs, Modiji, is taking the sting away from your warnings for ""stringent action""!

Btw, when its your own party &amp; members who are involved in this GauBhakti nonsense ofcourse it will be called **Political**!

When its an issue of hindutva goons using GauBhakti as a tool against muslims, ofcurse it will be calle **Communal**!
&gt;""All (state) governments should take stringent action against those who are violating law in the name of cow protection,"" 

 Terrorist Yogi (who started this GauRakshashas group) &amp; all BJP states please to take note!
&gt;These parties have also planned to raise the issue during the Parliament session starting tomorrow. 

Ah! So now we finally come to the real reason behind Modi's speech!
&gt;Modi also mentioned the presidential poll to be held tomorrow and said it would have been very good had a consensus been reached on the candidate. 

When you employed a cunning strategy to meet opposition without specifying a candidate and then announcing a RSS stooge kovind as your choice it was very evident of the consensus BJP showcased!

&gt;Modi also appeared to be taking a dig at RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is facing fresh corruption charges, as he sought cooperation in fight against corruption. 

&gt;**People involved in corruption should not be saved**, he said at the meeting, adding that the image of a political leader has taken a beating because of this. 

I have a doubt Modiji, how about people who were complicit in murder &amp; genocide? Who were in power and silently, if not succinctly , watched thousands being butchered? Are such people to be saved?

&gt;Modi also noted that the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement falls on August 9 and all parties should celebrate it.

**Ahead Of Monsoon Session, PM Modi Calls On States To Take Strict Action Against Cow Vigilantes** 

 ______ 
With a united opposition eyeing to corner the government in the Parliament over the recent incidents of beef lynchings, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned those breaking the law in the name of cow protection and asked the states to take stringent action against them.

PTI

Speaking at the all party meeting ahead of monsoon session the PM cautioned against giving political or communal colour to the issue.

“All (state) governments should take stringent action against those who are violating law in the name of cow protection,” Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said quoting the Prime Minister.

PTI

PM Modi also underlined the belief of many Hindus that cow is like mother, but said that this should not let people take law in their own hands and every state government should act against violation of the law, Kumar said after the meeting.

""There is a law on cow protection in the country. But committing crimes in the name of cow protection out of personal animosities cannot be tolerated,"" PM Modi said.

He alleged that some political parties were portraying cow protection as a communal issue to gain political mileage, which is detrimental to the country's secular fibre.

BCCL

""It (cow vigilantism) should not be given political or communal colour; the nation doesn't benefit from it. Everyone should come together and put an end to it,"" he said.

Opposition parties have attacked the BJP over the cases of cow vigilantism, in which Muslims and Dalits have often been targeted. These parties have also planned to raise the issue during the Parliament session starting Monday.

Last month, PM Modi had echoed a similar sentiment and said that ""killing in the name of cow worship is not acceptable"".

“All (state) governments should take stringent action against those who are violating the law in the name of cow protection,” Modi said at an all-party meeting a day before the Monsoon Session, parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar told reporters in New Delhi.

The prime minister also underlined the belief of many Hindus that cow is like mother, but said that this should not let people take law in their own hands and every state government should act against violation of the law, Kumar said after the meeting.

Opposition parties have attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the cases of cow vigilantism, in which Muslims and Dalits have often been targeted. These parties have also planned to raise the issue during the Parliament session starting Monday.

Modi also mentioned the presidential poll to be held Monday and said it would have been very good had a consensus been reached on the candidate. He, however, said “high level of dignity” has been maintained by both sides during the campaign and no “ill will or bad language” has been used. He said all political parties must ensure that everybody votes and no vote is wasted.

While the ruling BJP-led NDA has named Ram Nath Kovind as its candidate, the Congress-led group of opposition parties has pitted Meira Kumar against Kovind, who has a big numerical advantage over his rival.

Modi also appeared to be taking a dig at RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is facing fresh corruption charges, as he sought cooperation in fight against corruption. People involved in corruption should not be saved, he said at the meeting, adding that the image of a political leader has taken a beating because of this.

Kumar said Modi also noted that the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement falls on 9 August and all parties should celebrate it. Modi also thanked everyone for the implementation of the GST, calling it a “shining example of co-operative federalism”.

He told the all-party meeting that 30% of total expenditure and 49% of spending in the infrastructure sector had already taken place before the monsoon started due to the advancement of the budget.

On the issue of Kashmir and tensions with China, Kumar said the government had a meeting with opposition leaders and every party has said they were with the government on matters of national security.

**PM Modi puts onus on states, says check ‘communal violence in name of cow’**

(PTI Photo) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley at an all-party meeting ahead of monsoon session of Parliament, in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI Photo)

With the Opposition gearing to take on the Government in Parliament over the recent spate of lynchings by cow vigilantes and the alleged targeting of leaders by central agencies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed both issues, calling for “tough action” against violence in the name of protecting “gau mata” and appealing for support in action against the corrupt.

The Prime Minister was addressing an all-party meeting Sunday called by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar, a day before the start of the monsoon session.

Speaking to reporters, Kumar quoted Modi as saying: “Gau raksha ko kuchch asaamajik tatvon ne arajakata failane ka madhyam bana liya hai. Desh ke chhavi par bhi iska asar ho rahi hai. Hum sabhi rajnitik dalon ko gauraksha ke naam par ho rahi is gundagardi ki kadi bhartsana karni chaahiye (Some anti-social elements have made cow protection an excuse to spread anarchy. This is also affecting the nation’s image. All political parties should strongly condemn this hooliganism in the name of cow protection).”

“He said that state governments should take the strongest action against the anti-social elements carrying out violence in the name of cow protection because law and order is the prime responsibility of state governments,” Kumar quoted Modi as saying.

On corruption, Modi appeared to have made a veiled reference to RJD chief Lalu Prasad, with Kumar quoting him as saying: “Kanoon agar apna kaam kar raha hai to siyasi saazish ki baat karke bachne ka raasta dekh rahe logon ke prati hamein ekjut hokar kaam karna hoga (If the law is doing its work, we need to join hands against those who are looking for a way out in the name of a political conspiracy).”

Prasad, against whom a CBI FIR was registered this month on charges of corruption, had blamed the agency’s action as part of a “political vendetta” — a line that could be pursued in Parliament by the Congress and Trinamool Congress.

The Trinamool Congress boycotted Sunday’s meeting. JD(U) parliamentary party leader Sharad Yadav, too, gave it a miss due to “some personal reason”, said Kumar.

According to Kumar, the Prime Minister also said that the Government would ensure punishment for terrorists responsible for the attack on the Amarnath yatris last week; and thanked all parties for the implementation of GST, which was a “fine example of cooperative federalism”.

On the issue of Kashmir and China, Kumar said that all parties were with the Government “on the issue of national security”.

The Prime Minister also said that a consensus on the presidential candidate “would have been better” but hailed the “decorum” maintained during the campaign.

However, after the meeting, the buzz was all about Modi’s remarks on violence by cow vigilantes, particularly with the Government facing severe criticism from the Opposition on this issue.

Kumar said that the Government has sent an advisory to state governments in this regard. “The Prime Minister also said that a race has begun to gain political mileage by giving political and communal colour to issues like cow and protection and others, which will not do any good to the nation… everybody will have to join hands to check it,” he said.

Quoting Modi, Kumar said: “There is larger belief in the country that cow is the mother and should be protected but there is a law for it. Taking the law into one’s hand for it and carrying out atrocities in its name to settle personal scores cannot be tolerated at all and strong action should be taken.”

On corruption, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister quoted the Prime Minister as saying that the “fight against corruption had begun now”. “The Prime Minister appealed to all parties to join hands in this fight against corruption,” he said.

“There is a question mark now on the credibility of politicians and those in public life because of the rampant corruption that happened in the past and due to ills and wrong intentions of those who indulged in corruption”, Kumar quoted Modi as saying.

The Prime Minister said that people need to be convinced that “all politicians do not run after money”, said Kumar.

Modi, who was the last to speak at the meeting, also told the gathering that the Government’s decision to advance the presentation of the Union Budget has resulted in appreciation of 30 per cent in total expenditure and 49 per cent increase in infrastructure expenditure in three months.

The Opposition leaders present included Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad (Congress), Sharad Pawar (NCP), Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP), Farooq Abdullah (NC) and D Raja (CPI).

Azad, later, made it clear that Opposition parties would target the Government over J&amp;K as well as the stand-off with China. He said that the Government had “closed all doors for a dialogue” on Kashmir, which has led to “political suffocation”.

The Prime Minister’s visit to Israel is also likely to figure during the session, apart from the flood situation in Assam and other northeastern states, violence over Gorkhaland, the fallout of demonetisation, price rise, job losses and disinvestment of PSUs.

Yechury demanded the immediate passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill (108th Amendment Bill), 2008.

Kumar said that 21 bills were pending in Lok Sabha and 42 in Rajya Sabha. Nine of these, including The Whistle Blowers Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2015 and the National Commission for Backward Classes (Repeal) Bill, 2017, have been passed by the Lok Sabha and are listed for passage by Rajya Sabha.

I wasn't talking about this case. It s in front of Constitutional Bench which may pronounce verdict on 18th July, IIRC. But Aadhar-PAN link case was different and SC already reached on a verdict of that.

And yes I assumed Anti-Aadhar lobby is well funded, I never really checked,  may be wrong or may be **NOT.**

As I mentioned earlier, Aadhar is being Targeted systematically. Anti-Aadhar campaign is well organised and looks well funded. Won't be surprised if usual suspects like GreenPeace,Ford foundation turn out to be their benefactors. Who knows?

&gt;DONT fucking try and peddle your ignorance here, these guys have nothing to do with Environmental NGOs


First, who told you Environmental NGOs, like GreenPeace care about Environment?

I know about Technicalities of Aadhar. I admit this system is not perfect but very close. Honestly, most of arguments against Aadhar are superficial. Aadhar has proved t's mantle in the areas where it's active but this Anti-Aadhar Mafia just conveniently ignores this truth, [even when Data is just a few clicks away](http://aahar.jharkhand.gov.in/district_monthly_reports/)


Anti-Aadhar Mafia, misleads simpler folks, but never ever produced any concrete evidence. They either do not know Aadhar eco-system or chose to ignore it completely. Then they misguide people with horror stories like civic deaths, knowing very well that Aadhar eco-system have [checks &amp; balances for it.](https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in/) This deliberate ignorance (or an act of it) is devious and merits suspicion. This proves they do not have genuine grievances but wanna play spoil sport and derail a genuine reform. I, for a fact, know that there is a lot of scope for improvement in Aadhar &amp; UIDAI. I will fight for it with govt, eventually I will win. But unlike you, I don't call for **KILL AADHAR**


See, all I want is corruption free governance, the tax money pay must reach to intended beneficiary. I press my democratically elected govt for this. In return if govt ask for a tool, a mechanism, I will support my govt.

**Presidential elections 2017: 70 per cent votes with him, it’s Ram Nath Kovind vs Meira Kumar today** 

 ______ 
A former Bihar governor, Ram Nath Kovind hails from Uttar Pradesh while Meira Kumar, who earlier served as Lok Sabha Speaker, is the daughter of former deputy prime minister Jagjivan Ram.(File photo) A former Bihar governor, Ram Nath Kovind hails from Uttar Pradesh while Meira Kumar, who earlier served as Lok Sabha Speaker, is the daughter of former deputy prime minister Jagjivan Ram.(File photo)

On the eve of elections to select the 14th president of the country, which NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind looks set to sweep, Congress president Sonia Gandhi sought “a vote of conscience”, calling the contest “a clash of ideas and a conflict of disparate values”.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was addressing an all-party meeting ahead of the Parliament session, said it would have been better if the President had been chosen by consensus. “However, it is a matter of satisfaction and pride that the election campaign has been a dignified one. All the political parties need to be congratulated. All parties must train their MPs and MLAs to cast their votes so that not a single vote is wasted,” he added.

A total of 95 candidates filed nominations for the top Constitutional post, of which 93 were rejected on various grounds, leaving only Kovind and Opposition candidate Meira Kumar in the fray. While Kumar has support of 17 opposition parties, Kovind is set to get nearly 70 per cent of the electoral college votes.

Sonia acknowledged this in her speech on Sunday, at a meeting of non-NDA parties with Meira Kumar and the Opposition’s vice-presidential candidate, Gopalkrishna Gandhi. The numbers may be against the Opposition, she said, but “the battle must be fought and fought hard”. “We cannot and must not let India be hostage to those who wish to impose upon it a narrow-minded, divisive and communal vision,” Sonia said.

The Opposition’s campaign had been dealt the most decisive blow by the JD(U), a Congress ally in Bihar, which decided to back Kovind after being the first to moot the idea of putting up a joint candidate against the NDA’s. Taking the JD(U)’s cue, other parties had later lined up behind Kovind.

On Sunday, the JD(U) again absented itself from the Opposition meeting, though it has backed Gandhi for vice-president. It also stayed away from the all-party meeting chaired by Modi.

Explaining why they couldn’t attend the Opposition meeting, a JD(U) functionary said, “Why does the Congress create such an embarrassing situation for us? Why did they organise the meeting of MPs with both Meira Kumar and Gandhi? When we have not supported Meira Kumar’s candidature, how could we go there?”

Senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav later went to meet Gandhi at his residence in Delhi and assured him of the party’s support. As of now, 18 parties have supported his candidature.

A source in the BJP familiar with Kovind’s election campaign said that the NDA nominee, who had started with 28 parties backing him, now has the support of 42. As part of his campaign, Kovind visited 27 states, including in the Northeast. The BJP leader said he got a good response everywhere. Meira Kumar also campaigned across states, starting from Gandhi Ashram in Sabarmati.

In her speech, Sonia said, “What is at stake is our future, and the values we cherish and must uphold, especially at this time of grave disquiet. This election represents a clash of ideas, a conflict of disparate values. The election demands a vote of conscience to preserve the India that the Mahatma and that illustrious generation of freedom fighters, joined by thousands upon thousands of ordinary men and women, fought for.”

Noting that the president and vice-president are constitutional heads of state and are entrusted to discharge the duties of their offices in a manner that preserves, protects and defends both the Constitution and the law, she said, “Both of these are, sadly, under siege today.”

A former Bihar governor, Kovind hails from Uttar Pradesh while Meira Kumar, who earlier served as Lok Sabha Speaker, is the daughter of former deputy prime minister Jagjivan Ram. Though both the BJP and Congress highlighted the caste of their candidates, Meira Kumar had disapproved of projecting it as a “Dalit versus Dalit” fight.

Kovind has underlined the importance of maintaining the supremacy of the Constitution and said he had had nothing to do with any party since he became governor, and that he believed that the post of president should be above party politics.

The counting of votes will take place on July 20 in New Delhi after all the ballot boxes have been brought from various state capitals. Incumbent Pranab Mukherjee’s term comes to an end on July 24.

A total of 4,896 voters — 4,120 MLAs and 776 elected MPs — are eligible to cast their ballot. Since the election is through a secret ballot, the parties cannot issue a whip to their members to vote for a particular candidate. A total of 32 polling stations — one in Parliament House and one each in the state legislative Assemblies — have been set up.

Thirty-three observers have been appointed by the EC to oversee the election. While two observers will be present in Parliament House, one each will be deployed at the Assemblies.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Goa CM Manohar Parrikar are among 55 MPs who will vote in their Assemblies instead of Parliament House. Five MLAs will cast their ballot in Parliament House.

**India not to host G20 meet due to absence of mega centre, 2019 polls** 

 ______ 
G20 meeting +

elections in 2019 +

NEW DELHI: The absence of a world-class convention centre and the 2019 general elections have prompted the government to give a go-by to hosting the, something that it was very keen on.In fact, due to the elections, the Narendra Modi administration wanted to host the event — comprising several meetings involving finance ministers, central bank governors and trade and labour ministers leading up to the leaders' summit — in 2018 itself but Argentina was not willing to swap. But with ITPO's revamped Pragati Maidan facility as well as the Global Convention Centre planned by the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC) in Dwarka nowhere in sight, the government decided to wait for a few more years, said sources. As a result, Japan will be the host country in 2019 and India will have to wait a few more years till Asia gets its turn. It will have to compete with Indonesia to be the host, according to sources.The government is keen to pitch the country into the big league, especially at a time when the Indian economy is seen to be more attractive than that of China. The G20 bid was also aimed at attracting convention traffic to India to create jobs and expand tourism opportunities. ""We do not have a world class convention centre yet. The one in Dwarka will take time and then you have the. Therefore, it is safe to make a bid to host the 2021 or 2022 meeting,"" said an official, who did not wish to be identified.While India has hosted some top global meets, including a meeting of the leaders of the BRICS nations, hosting a G20 meeting would require a world class convention centre and massive infrastructure. Authorities say that the BRICs meeting in the tourist destination of Goa had exposed several gaps and they would not want to hold a G20 meeting without adequate preparations.""We want to showcase our best and therefore it is better to postpone it and not make a serious bid for the 2019 meeting,"" the official added. The facilities in Pragati Maidan in the heart of the national capital are also not expected to be ready soon. Hosting the event here would mean putting in place elaborate plans for diverting traffic to ensure smooth movement of leaders and their delegations. Vigyan Bhawan is seen to be inadequate to host a meeting of this scale. It will also require massive security arrangements for some of the most heavily guarded leaders in addition to having parking facilities for several aircraft from 19 countries, including Kenya, Spain and the Netherlands — which are special invitees.The G20 meet attracts journalists from across the world as well as a large delegation of officials. Former hosts such as Australia and France have opted to have some of the ministerial meetings in other cities, a practice that may be adopted by India, too.

&gt;A unique phenomenon in the history of Bharat in the twentieth century is the birth and unceasing growth of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The Sangh’s sphere of influence has been spreading far and wide, not only inside Bharat but also abroad, like the radiance of a many splendored diamond. Sangh-inspired institutions and movements today form a strong presence in social, cultural, educational, labour, developmental, political and other fields of nationalist endeavour. Sangh initiated movements - be they social-reformist or anti-secessionist - evoke ready response and approbation from the common multitudes as well as from vast numbers of elite of different shades. It has increasingly been recognized that the Sangh is not a mere reaction to one or another social or political aberration. It represents a corpus of thought and action firmly rooted in genuine nationalism and in the age old tradition of this country. Source: RSS website

This does not sound like a non political entity though. They are dangerous and if left unchecked will destroy the nation as it stands and are already doing so by sowing discord, by resorting to violence in any dispute or issue that they disagree with. They did so in 2002 in Gujarat where their goons were left unchecked for 24 hours and they went on a rampage killing people, where they killed a Christian missionary and his little children in Orissa, when they demolished the Babri Masjid, the Gau rakshaks now, the anti valentines day crusaders in Mangalore and Pune and so on.

The lower the percentage, the more successful DeMo was. The higher the percentage the bigger a flop it was. The RBI gave their last update in the middle of December and since then has not released any new information.

**Presidential elections 2017: All you need to know about today's vote** 

 ______ 
1. The President is elected by the electoral college. This body comprises all elected members of Parliament and the members of the legislative assemblies of all states, as well as of the union territories of Delhi and Puducherry.2. The total strength of the electoral college is 10,98,903 votes, with each Parliamentarian carrying a vote value of 708. The vote weight of a member of a State Assembly is calculated keeping in mind the population of the state he or she represents. A candidate needs 50 per cent-plus votes to win the poll. That translates to 5,49,452 votes.3. Kovind's victory against Kumar is said to be a foregone conclusion because almost 40 parties, including many from outside the NDA fold, have pledged to support him. Significantly, Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (U), will also be supporting Kovind, going against its Bihar 'grand alliance' partners, the Congress and Lalu Prasad's RJD. The non-NDA parties that are expected to vote for Kovind are the AIADMK, the Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party, the Biju Janata Dal, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the Indian National Lok Dal. The total votes of all those supporting Kovind comed to over 60 percent, which is a lot higher than the required 50 percent.4. The joint Opposition candidate Kumar has the support of the Congress, of course, as well as of the Nationalist Congress Party, the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samajwadi Party, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the All India Trinamool Congress, the Communist parties, the DMK, and the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, among a few others. However, AAP plans to abstain as its leader H.S. Phoolka, who has handled several 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases which some Congress leaders are implicated in, has said he cannot vote for the Congress candidate. The total electoral votes of these parties comes to a little over 39 percent, way below the 50 percent mark.5. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has even wished Kovind ""in advance"" and has assured him of his government's support. The PM said that Kovind's journey, whether as a lawyer or a politician, has always been non-controversial, and his Presidential poll campaign has been the same.6. Opposition leader and Congress president Sonia Gandhi has meanwhile appealed for a ""conscience vote"". She said on Sunday that this Presidential election ""represents a clash of ideas, (and) a conflict of disparate values."" ""In these contests, the numbers may be against us. But the battle must be fought and fought hard,"" the Congress president said.7. The voting on Monday will be held between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm. Paper ballots will be used and the votes will be valid only if a special violet ink pen is used to vote. The MPs will vote on green ballots and the MLAs will vote on pink ballots. Ballot boxes from the States will be flown and stored in Room 62 of Parliament.8. Officials said that polling in Parliament House will take place in room number 62. Parliamentarians will vote according to tables allocated to the States they represent. The PM, Congress president Sonia and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will vote on table number 6 as they are all MPs from Uttar Pradesh. There will be six tables. And MLAs who have chosen to vote in Delhi will do so from table number 1.9. The counting of votes will take place on July 20 in Delhi. President Pranab Mukherjee's term is expiring on July 25.10. The election for the post of Vice President is scheduled for August 5. Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the joint Opposition candidate for the post, will file his nomination papers on Tuesday. The NDA has yet to decide on its candidate for the post and a BJP parliamentary board meeting later on Monday is expected to discuss the issue.(With inputs from Agencies)

**‘Real Estate and Politics are Sources and Sinks of Black Money’** 

 ______ 
Describing politics and real estate as the primary “sources and sinks of black money in India” a policy paper published by the Pune International Centre has recommended a number of collateral steps subsequent to demonetisation, to constrain the Black Money economy.

These steps would be necessary if the Narendra Modi Government’s thrust to constrain the black money economy is to be successful, the paper, by Dr. V. Bhaskar, member 13th Finance Commission, has said.

A noted economist and an ex-IAS officer, Dr. Bhaskar has worked previously with the International Monetary Fund, and at the ministries of finance, commerce and industries. He has acknowledged the inputs received from Vijay Kelkar, architect of the GST model and chairman of the 13th Finance Commission, and Pune-based economist Prof. Pradeep Apte, for an earlier version of the paper.

Published by PIC, the paper states unambiguously that politics and real estate are the primary sources and sinks of black money in India, the other sources being tax evasion, corruption and criminality.

One of its primary recommendations is that “all political parties should be compliant with the provisions of the RTI Act.” As a part of this effort, political parties should publish their accounts after they are audited by an CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) approved auditor and submit details of all donations above Rs. 20,000 to the Election Commission of India (ECI), under their annual returns.

“When donations below Rs.20,000 exceed 20% of the party’s total receipts or Rs. 20 crore, details of all donations should be provided,” Dr. Bhaskar has noted. He has recommended that all parties which do not comply should be de-registered by the ECI to underscore transparency in the funding of political parties.

While the above steps need to be taken by the ECI, the central government needs to take steps to “effectualise existing anti-black money legislations and operationalise Bills already passed such as the Benami Transactions Bill, the paper said.

The Government also needs to scrutinize the list of pending, lapsed and proposed laws aimed at addressing black money, “bring them to an irreducible minimum” and then accelerate the enactment and implementation of these limited laws.

The paper has called for a review of labour laws so that more of the work force joins the formal sector,

constraining the generation of black money in this field.

Real estate and alcohol for human consumption needs to be brought under the GST base to incentivize more formal transactions in these two important sector.

The government also needs to adopt methodologies to limit the use of agricultural income as a black money refuge and effectively implement the National Litigation Policy, the paper has noted.

Speaking to Hindustan Times, Pune International Centre’s Honorary Director Prashant Girbane said the report by Dr. Bhaskar written after demonetization, has been published by the PIC. “The report would be sent to the government in the due course. It’s objective is to create public discourse and discussion,” Girbane said.

Following are the other highlights of the report:

Corruption:

Apart from tax evasion, Dr. Bhaskar has listed corruption involving the political executive and the bureaurcracy, and criminality as the major sources of black money. He has pointed out that increasing Government expenditure on infrastructure projects, irrigation schemes and social welfare projects, as well as allocation of natural resources to private parties for use “afford opportunities for the generation of illegal incomes.”

He has noted that corruption (tax evasion and misuse of power) is equally prevalent in the private sector, especially in the education and health sectors.

Organised and unorganized criminality in the form of crimes involving drugs, extortion, prostitution, and human trafficking generates resources which escape tax.

Sinks of Black Money

The primary sinks of black money in India are in the form of cash, bullion and precious stones, luxuries, leisure and entertainment industry, penny companies and dummy corporations, real estate, the “political ecosphere” and foreign holdings.

Black money generated through cash is often converted and held in the form of strong international currencies such as the US dollar and the Euro. However, given the vulnerabilities arising from its possession, “it is mostly converted to other sinks,” Dr.Bhaskar has stated.

He has pointed out that penny companies and dummy corporations are one of the major sinks of black money in India and barely six lakh of the 15 lakh registered companies file their returns under the Companies Act. Although the Enforcement Directorate has taken up large-scale, country-wide investigations into dummy companies, “covering all the registered companies remains a monumental task.”

Real Estate has been identified as a major source and sink for black money in India. While real estate, ownership of buildings and business services contributes about 10% to the GDP, the construction sector alone contributes about 8%. “This extremely significant sector needs focused attention by the Government to dilute its dependence on the black economy,” Dr. Bhaskar notes.

Alongside Real Estate, Dr. Bhaskar has drawn attention to black money generation in the political ecosphere in India, stating that it is generated in various forms to support contributions to most political parties. “To that extent, politics is a sink of black money where it is “retained”. At the time of elections and “political stress”, this sector becomes a source of black money “which is mainly spent on consumption, ironically, generating taxes for the government,” Dr. Bhaskar has noted.

Tax Agricultural Income

He has called for imposition of taxes on agricultural income while allowing for exclusion of of small farmers with incomes below a threshold of around Rs 10 lakhs per annum. Stating that very few states levy taxes on agricultural incomes, he has pointed out that often, agricultural income is used as a channel to launder black money holdings into white. “The lack of up-to-date land ownership and cultivation ecords compounds this opportunity. Thus, agricultural income, as long as it is not taxed will continue to be a sink for black money,” he has pointed out.

Black Money and Foreign Holdings

The paper points out that black money is also exported through tax evasion in international trade and hawala transactions. It is either invested abroad or “round tripped” to India through direct mechanisms like FDI (Foreign Direct Investments) or indirect mechanisms like Participatory Notes. While all of three mechanisms are illegal and can be addressed through existing laws, the paper states that weak implementation of the laws by the bureaucracy “dilutes the effectiveness of the existing laws.”

**Gujarat HC turns down Essar Steel's bad loan plea in big win for banks** 

 ______ 
What could be a big boost for the government's drive against corporate bad loans, the Gujarat High Court today dismissed a plea by Essar Steel against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On July 14, it had reserved its order for Monday on Essar Steel's plea against the June 13 RBI circular to banks to act under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against the steel major and 11 other firms with over Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans each.The court had earlier stayed the insolvency proceedings against Essar Steel before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) as an interim measure on its plea.Essar Steel had moved court against the June 13 RBI circular contending that the order was improper as the firm was in an advanced stage of loan restructuring.The company had argued before the HC that it should not be treated on par with other eleven accounts (firms) which have been closed now, while Essar Steel is still doing well with an annual turnover of Rs 20,000 crore.Recovery of bad loans, a millstone around the neck of Indian banks, had gathered momentum after years of dithering when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government empowered the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last month to direct banks to take big defaulters through the process prescribed under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code that specifies time-bound resolution.Cracking down on bad loans, the RBI last month identified 12 accounts for insolvency proceedings with each of them having over Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans, accounting for 25 per cent of total non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks.Indian banking system is saddled with sticky loans. Bad loans at state-run banks have increased by more than Rs 1 lakh crore since April 2016 to Rs 6 lakh crore as of December 31. This goes up to Rs 10 lakh crore when those of private and other lenders are added on.The stressed assets of Indian banks are likely to increase to 15% of total loans by March 2018 amid rising requirements for regulatory capital until 2019, S&amp;P Global ratings said in a report recently.

**Is SASEC road project India’s answer to China’s OBOR?** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: India is pulling out all stops to expedite the South Asian Sub-Regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) road connectivity program in the backdrop of China’s ambitious “One Belt One Road” initiative aimed at connecting around 60 countries across Asia, Africa and Europe.

As part of this strategy, India’s Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) last week approved a Rs1,630 crore road project for upgradation and widening of the 65-km road stretch between Imphal in Manipur and Moreh in Myanmar. Once completed, the project being developed with Asian Development Bank’s loan assistance will not only help India connect with its neighbouring countries but will also play an important role in the Great Asian Highway.

More From Livemint »

The Asian Highway network is also referred to as the Great Asian Highway, and is a 141,000-km road network connecting 32 Asian countries being developed under the aegis of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).

“The SASEC program focuses on road infrastructure to improve regional connectivity between Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and India (BBIN). The Imphal-Moreh project corridor is also a part of Asian Highway 1 and will also strengthen India’s position at the global level as we are attempting to connect with our neighbours and fulfilling our commitments made at the international level,” said a senior Indian government official, requesting anonymity.

The seven-member SASEC formed in 2001 comprises India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, and aims to increase economic growth by building cross-border connectivity.

The Asian Highway network starts from Tokyo in Japan and connects South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran to the border between Turkey and Bulgaria, west of Istanbul, where it joins with European route E80.

“Developing road connectivity with neighbours is one of the key agendas of the Modi government,” added the government official quoted above.

With an eye on China, India has tasked state-run National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corp. Ltd (NHIDCL) to work on a slew of road and bridge projects to improve connectivity with Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, Mint reported on 6 July.

Myanmar occupies a unique geographical position which India plans to leverage.

“The road is a part of Asian Highway 1 and will be developed at a cost of Rs1,630 crore. It is an important connection from India to Myanmar. As per our plans, the first 20 km would be four lane and next (remaining stretch) two-lane. Once the highway is built, it will reduce travel time by half and will boost the region for traffic and trade,” said Sanjay Jaju, director finance at NHIDCL, which is building the stretch.

India has been critical of China developing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part OBOR infrastructure initiative cutting through Gilgit and Baltistan areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). OBOR, first unveiled by Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to put billions of dollars in infrastructure projects, including railways, ports and power grids across Asia, Africa and Europe.

Myanmar’s role has not been lost on SASEC’s playbook either.

“SASEC member countries recognize that most of SASEC’s multimodal connectivity initiatives include Myanmar. Road corridors in Myanmar provide the key links between South Asia and Southeast Asia. Ports in Myanmar will provide additional gateways to the landlocked North Eastern region of India. Development of multi-modal connectivity between North Eastern region of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar has the potential of unleashing tremendous economic energy in the sub-region,” the Indian government said in a 1 April statement.

India is also moving ahead with its plans of accessing transnational multi-modal connectivity to articulate its role in the proposed transportation architecture in the region and beyond. It has been instrumental in implementing the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, which will run from Moreh in Manipur to Mae Sot in Thailand via Myanmar.

**PM Modi Leads BJP Meeting, Venkaiah Naidu Front-Runner For Veep** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top BJP leaders are meeting to finalise a
name for Vice President. Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, believed to be the
front-runner, said as he headed to the meeting: ""I am not aspiring to become
anything. Whatever the parliamentary board decides, that is final.""

The words did nothing to dispel the impression that Mr Naidu, 68, is less than
enthusiastic about the job, though they did imply that he would accept the
party's decision.

Sources say it is certain that the vice presidential pick will be a person
from south India, where the BJP wants to strengthen its presence. PM Modi,
however, has to decide whether he is ready to spare a top minister; it was the
factor that ruled out a minister for the post of president.

Mr Naidu, it is believed, conveyed his reluctance to his party in meetings
today. In the past, he has made no bones about it. ""I neither want to become

_Rashtrapati_

(president), nor do I want to become

_Uprashtrapati_

(vice president). I am happy being Usha's

_pati _

(wife Usha's husband),"" he said in May.

Last month, he stressed: ""Never am I going to participate in the vice-
presidential elections even if anyone compels me."" Like in the case of
President, the BJP's Vice President nominee is also expected to sail through;
with the backing of southern parties like AIADMK, Telengana Rashtra Samiti and
YSR Congress, the government candidate is likely to win the votes of 557 MPs
in the electoral college of 787 MPs.

M Venkaiah Naidu is the front-runner to be BJP's choice for Vice President

Sources say the BJP and its advisers have a clear set of requirements and Mr
Naidu checks most boxes - which include the ability to run smoothly the Rajya
Sabha, where the Vice President is chairman and where the government is
currently in a minority, and belief in the core values of the BJP and its
ideological mentor the RSS.

Opposition parties last week named as their vice presidential candidate Gopal
Krishna Gandhi, a former governor who was also briefly considered by them for
the post of president.

Now if only GST was implemented by UPA, imagine what the BJP would have done with so much propaganda material in hand!

They would have sent some goons to paint Manmohan Singh black to show him  as the worst Prime Minister of the country and activated their RSS network to create trouble in the country, like they did when gas went from 330 to 440 but now are keeping quiet when it is at 775/-.

Anna Hazare too would have gone on a Hunger Strike in Ram Leela Maidan and TimesNow, Arnab Goswami would have ripped the anti-national Congress which was proposing 14% GST, apart.

Now that Great Modi Tamasha is on, Arnab Goswami is busy singing praises of the 28% Gale-Ki-Haddi and assuring the nation that anybody who does not pay GST or opposes GST is anti-national. Only difference is that he is now barking from Republic Channel, which has a much smaller following while Navika Kumar is doing the honors from TimesNow.

And the usual culprits, Rajat India TV Sharma and Sudhir Tihari Zee TV Chaudhary are doing their roles to the hilt.

**For Vice President, BJP Picks Venkaiah Naidu vs Gopalkrishna Gandhi** 

 ______ 
BJP has chosen Venkaiah Naidu as their Vice Presidential candidate.

**New Delhi: **

Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu is the BJP's choice for Vice Presidential
candidate against Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the
opposition's nominee.

BJP chief Amit Shah announced the decision after a meeting of top BJP leaders
headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi this evening. Mr Naidu will file his
nomination tomorrow for the August 5 election.

""Whatever the parliamentary board decides, that is final,"" Mr Naidu, the Urban
Development Minister, had said before the meeting.

""I am neither runner up, nor winner up. I am not aspiring to be anything,
there is no such habit in BJP. The party decides,"" he asserted, not denying
that he was the party's choice but telegraphing that he was less than
enthusiastic about the job.

But the party had more or less decided even before the meeting, it appeared; a
note on the 68-year-old's ""journey to VP's office"" was shared even before any
decision was announced.

Mr Naidu checks important boxes for the party - he shares a good equation with
all parties, is seen as the right man to run smoothly the Rajya Sabha, where
the Vice President is chairman and where the government is currently in a
minority, and he believes in the core values of the BJP and its ideological
mentor the RSS.

**Gujarat: Dalits launch mission to make India untouchability-free by 2047** 

 ______ 
Politically, we are equal as we all have the right to vote. So let us use it wisely and give it to those who agree with our agenda,” said Prakash Ambedkar. (Representative Image) Politically, we are equal as we all have the right to vote. So let us use it wisely and give it to those who agree with our agenda,” said Prakash Ambedkar. (Representative Image)

Dalits from 1,000 villages of Gujarat came together at Dalit Shakti Kendra in Sanand’s Nani Devati village to launch a mission to declare India free of untouchability by 2047 with the slogan “Ram naam satya chhe, abhadchhet haqeeqat chhe (Name of Ram is truth; untouchability is a fact). The members have chosen cup and saucer and supda (used for cleaning foodgrain) as the mission’s symbols.

“A cup and saucer because discrimination starts when members of lower castes are given different saucers to drink tea. Cup and saucer also because our Prime Minister Narendra Modi used to be a chaiwala… Supda because it is made by various lower caste people. It is a symbol that stands for the collective effort of lower castes,” Dalit activist and managing trustee of Navsarjan Trust Martin Macwan told the gathering.

On August 4, they are planning to take a supda and a blank certificate to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. They will ask him to write the name of the village that he declared ‘untouchability free’ on the certificate.

“The issue of discrimination continues in our country. People asked me why am I planning for eradicating untouchability 30 years from now. I think they should ask me why are we doing this so late. This will take time, but it is our way of ensuring an equal society for our youngsters. Ram Nath Kovind is in Ahmedabad today and let me tell you that on the day he filed his nomination for Presidential polls, a havan was conducted in his village. They did not pay homage to Baba Saheb or Savitribai, but performed a havan. This shows what we are in for,” said Macwan.

Dalit activist Uttam Parmar and Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr B R Ambedkar, were also present at the meeting.

“We should start with eliminating untouchability among ourselves. Let’s do away with various groups we have within our sub-castes. If we do not become one, then we do not have the right to say anything against Manusmriti. Politically, we are equal as we all have the right to vote. So let us use it wisely and give it to those who agree with our agenda,” said Prakash Ambedkar.

Balu Sarvaiya, whose family members were attacked by gau rakshaks in Una last year, attended the meet with his wife and children. “We are here because even in our village we are treated as untouchables. Barbers refuse to shave the men of Dalits, women of our community are harassed often and even today in tea shops they give us a separate saucer to drink,” said Balu.

**2013 MP riots over cow: SC raps police for not producing video as evidence** 

 ______ 
The Supreme Court on Monday castigated the Madhya Pradesh police for not getting a video pertaining to the 2013 communal riots over rumours of cow slaughter and producing them as crucial evidence before a trial court, warning the officials of action.

“You (Deputy Superintendent of SIB) are in for a serious trouble, sir! Why have you not got the VCD examined,” asked a a bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud, while taking strong note of the acquittal of nine of the 12 accused persons in one of the 12 rioting cases in which FIRs have been lodged.

The bench warned that it would “fix accountability” of the concerned police officers.

“Nine persons, out of 12, have been acquitted. Three have been absconding,” it said, asking why no action has been taken and was it because the accused belonged to “a political party”.

The bench then granted two weeks to activist Anurag Modi, who had filed the plea through advocate Pyoli, to peruse the judgement of a district court acquitting nine persons in a rioting case. Modi had filed the appeal against an order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case.

It also asked the police officials to respond why they did not get the VCD of the crime authenticated by a forensic laboratory and produce it as evidence before the trial court.

Initially, the court was convinced that the police had annexed the VCD in their charge sheet and a social activist was not supposed to interfere with the probe and the police reports.

Later, the bench got irked when it was informed that the VCD was not used as evidence in the lower court and nine accused have been acquitted in a case.

Earlier, the apex court had taken the state police to task, saying it seemed it had not examined the videos and photographs pertaining to the riots which had been triggered by an alleged rumour that a cow had been slaughtered.

It had directed the Investigating Officer (IO), who had probed the 12 FIRs lodged in connection with the riots that had taken place on September 9, 2013 in Kheda and Pahatgaon villages of Harda district, to appear before it on Monday.

In the riots, 54 persons had lost their houses and businesses. Twelve FIRs were registered by police naming Surendra Singh Rajput alias Tiger as the main accused in all the cases.

The apex court, on February 17, had directed the state police “to place the concerned charge sheet, along with the translated version thereof, on the record of the case” within four weeks.

On perusal of the charge sheets, the court had pointed out that they had not identified the culprits.

Modi had sought a probe against local BJP leader and former minister Kamal Patel and his son alleging they had instigated the riots with an eye on the assembly elections slated three months later.

The High Court had rejected the plea saying that the probe in the case was complete.

The petitioner had alleged that the riots were orchestrated by the Bajrang Dal, VHP and Goraksha Commando Force and that the then District Magistrate had named these organisations in his letter to Assistant Chief Secretary (Home) on September 20, 2013.

However, these organisations were not named in any of the charge sheets filed in the case, it alleged.

“The entire incident was stage managed and well-planned, attempted to be portrayed as one of communal nature. In fact, the cow had died of choking of respiratory pipe and asphyxia caused by large amount polythene consumption ... and 12 FIRs were registered initially, yet none included the names” of the BJP members “who were main conspirators and instigators,” the plea alleged.

The petition has sought a CBI probe in the matter on the ground that the local police was hand-in-glove with the leader. It has also alleged that Surendra Singh Rajput, the key accused named in all 12 FIRs, was still absconding.

**All India Bakchod booked in one day, woman’s 16-month-old complaint still pending** 

 ______ 
The Mumbai Police on their own instantly filed an FIR for defamation against All India Bhakchod for a tweet on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but they are yet to file a defamation case on the complaint made by a woman activist 16 months ago that she was being trolled on Twitter.

Aftab Siddique, local activist and chairperson of the 33rd Road Khar ALM-14, has struggled since last year to file a first information report (FIR) for online harassment and defamatory comments against her on Twitter. Despite several efforts she is still to get a copy of the FIR and is not even sure if an FIR has been registered by the police.

Siddique became a target of trolls on Twitter for supporting poor tenants of a slum rehabilitation authority building against a builder. She was called an extortionist, a blackmailer, a thief, and a bribe taker several times on Twitter. In March last year, she approached the Khar police and managed to get only a non-cognisable (NC) complaint registered even though she gave a written complaint alleging defamation.

Senior advocate Abha Singh told HT that a FIR is made out for defamation in case a person calls you an extortionist on the internet.

However, Aftab did not give up. She wrote complaints to Mumbai Police Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar in April last year, which was forwarded to the cyber police within two days. Aftab was called to the cyber police station a year later, in May this year, to record her statements.

However ,till date Aftab is not sure if the police have even registered a FIR in the matter. “I am still to get a copy of the FIR. They told me they will take Bandra magistrate court’s permission to find out if my FIR is made out. Did they take court’s permission to file the case against AIB? They told me they will register a case but I am not sure as I am yet to get a copy of the FIR. A copy is supposed to be given to the complainant on the day an FIR is registered.” Aftab has submitted a list of 13 names to the Mumbai police , whom she accuses of defaming her on Twitter.

HT’s phone calls to the deputy commissioner of police (cyber), Akbar Pathan, went unanswered.

**Make transparency a patriotic duty** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Modi is the most vocal advocate of transparency that India has seen till date. Prime Minister Modi is the most vocal advocate of transparency that India has seen till date.

Soon after the GST regime was rolled out, the Hon’ble Prime Minister announced that the Registrars of Companies (RoC) had struck 100,000 shell companies off their rolls. Addressing chartered accountants in Delhi on July 1, 2017, Mr Narendra Modi said this historical decision was a sterling example of how tough decisions can be taken if “patriotism” served as the inspiration.

The 3,000-strong gathering welcomed this announcement with thunderous applause and the media reported it as another step in the direction of curbing the influence of black money, stemming the tide of corruption and cleaning up the economy, as part of the demonetisation exercise that was launched on November 8, 2016.

So far, so good. This author spent more than an hour looking for the list of companies struck off the rolls by Delhi’s RoC, in vain. The website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs only displays a public notice from April this year, inviting objections from any person on the proposal to terminate more than 26,000 registered companies for being “defunct” and not seeking ‘dormant’ status formally under the law.

This is not to doubt the veracity of the Hon’ble PM‘s announcement. Instead this is one of the indicators of how compliant public authorities are with the transparency requirements of the Right to Information Act (RTI Act). This 12-year old law places a duty on every public authority to place all relevant facts and figures while announcing decisions that affect the public at large. The ‘termination’ of shell companies eminently qualifies to such treatment. Yet, there is very little detailing of action taken by the RoCs.

Since October, 2005 almost every government has breached its obligation of transparency repeatedly. The bureaucracy has fought shy of graduating from transparency on a “need to know basis” (where the government decides what people should or should not know) to openness founded on the “people’s right to know” as streamlined by the RTI Act.

It comes as no surprise that the government has repeatedly refused to disclose details about the November 2016 demonetisation exercise as well, despite attracting enormous public support. The citizenry is required to applaud and cheer every decision but it simply cannot be trusted with the details of the decision making process, it seems.

Making sense of the “method” behind the treatment meted out towards transparency by the erstwhile UPA and the current NDA regimes is difficult to rationalise. Although the enactment of the RTI law was hailed by many as a historic juncture, next in importance only to India’s independence from colonial rule, and the UPA Government showcased it as one of its biggest achievements, the then Prime Minister certainly did not seem convinced of its value. On several occasions, Dr. Manmohan Singh voiced his concerns about the “misuse” of the RTI law although it turned out later that his office did not have any factual data to back up this claim.

Even before the RTI law could reach its first anniversary, the UPA Cabinet decided to amend it to keep file notings or the deliberations of bureaucrats and ministers in any decision-making process away from the public gaze. Thanks to the very vocal opposition from those who had used the RTI law to dramatic effect to expose corruption and wrongdoing at various levels, this proposal had to be shelved.

Nevertheless, the UPA was instrumental in setting up a gigantic data portal that enabled any person to track the manner of implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act in real time. Few initiatives taken by governments in other developing countries could match this transparency initiative. This was not all. Tour reports of ministers and senior bureaucrats visiting abroad were required to be made public, MOUs with and earnings of public private partnerships were made transparent and templates were issued to make panchayats, government schools and hospitals in villages to volunteer information about their working.

In complete contrast with his predecessor, Prime Minister Modi is the most vocal advocate of transparency that India has seen till date. Not only did the NDA make transparent and accountable government as its springboard to capture power, while celebrating the 10th anniversary of the RTI Act, the PM urged the public authorities to study the trend of information requests from citizens. Bureaucrats were advised to examine what categories of information people were seeking again and again and if they could be disclosed voluntarily so that people’s need to seek information through RTI applications is progressively reduced- in fact the very purpose of the RTI Act. Till date, no such exercise has been reported by any ministry or department at the Central level. The bureaucracy seems to be sleeping over this commonsensical and practical idea.

Next, in April, 2016, the Central Information Commission (CIC) issued a progressive recommendation requiring the Government to publicise the details of work done by every ministry and department. The Cabinet Secretariat took uncharacteristically rapid action on this recommendation and issued a circular to all ministries requiring them to publish reports of major achievements, events and occurrences and decisions taken every month. More than a year has passed since then, compliance remains extremely poor (less than 10% of the ministries are complying with this directive). In fact, the Government confessed that it did not have a mechanism to monitor the implementation of its own circular, when quizzed by two members of the Lok Sabha in March, this year.

Or take the case of the Naga framework agreement signed in August 2015 with much fanfare. Reporting on this big breakthrough where at least one Naga faction agreed to come to the discussion table, the Government assured that details of the agreement would be publicly disclosed soon. Almost two years have passed, but the Government has stubbornly refused to disclose any details of this agreement despite the topic coming up for debate again and again, most recently, during the recent Assembly elections held in Manipur.

The CIC also upheld the decision to keep the entire matter under wraps in a case filed by the author. While some Naga spokespersons are openly commenting on the content of the negotiations, the citizen-taxpayer, it seems, has to wait for the official will to turn in favour of transparency to ascertain the truth behind their claims.

It is not as if the NDA Government has paid only lip sympathy for transparency by preaching from the pulpit without any follow-up. Soon after coming to power the NDA Government amended the conduct rules applicable to bureaucrats of all ranks- making transparency and accountability as core values that should inform their working. Nevertheless, the policy level commitment to transparency has not translated into actual practice at the cutting edge level of the administration belying the promise of open and minimum government.

Why is the bureaucracy fighting back against transparency instead of toeing the line? Why is the political executive unable to get the administration to deliver on this commitment? This contrast between the words and the actions of the UPA and NDA Governments requires in-depth study.

In the interim, it might help if transparency were declared a “patriotic duty” to secure compliance from the administration. Few other values seem to be attracting as much attention and action in these turbulent times.

**GST means Going Stronger Together, says PM Modi on Day 1 of Parliaments Monsoon Session** 

 ______ 
Ahead of Monsoon Session today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the successful launch of the Goods and Services Tax would infuse fresh energy in the Parliament session.

Giving a new definition of the Goods and Services Tax, PM Modi said, ""GST means Going Stronger Together"". Modi also said, ""Just as rain brings typical fragrance from the earth, the successful launch of the GST would give new enthusiasm to the Monsoon Session.""

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on July 1 at the special midnight session of Parliament.

In a series of posts on Twitter, PM Modi further said, ""Today the Monsoon Session begins. Like the Monsoon brings hope, this session also brings same spirit of hope. GST shows the good that can be achieved when all parties come together and work for the nation.""

""The GST spirit is about growing stronger together. I hope the same GST spirit prevails in the session,"" read another tweet of Prime Minister Modi.

The GST spirit is about growing stronger together. I hope the same GST spirit prevails in the session: PM @narendramodi - PMO India (@PMOIndia) July 17, 2017

The Monsoon Session of Parliament begins today and will continue till August 11. The session will have 19 sittings.

MONSOON SESSION: THINGS TO KNOW Both Houses of Parliament will take up obituary references today and may not transact business due to the death of some sitting members. Two Rajya Sabha members - former Union minister Anil Madhav Dave and Congress member Palvai Govardhan Reddy - died during the interregnum period after the budget session while sitting Gurdaspur Lok Sabha member Vinod Khanna also diedduring that period. Opposition is united on several issues to corner the Modi government. Opposition is likely to raise the heat on the government over issues like lynching incidents and vigilantism, the Kashmir situation and the border stand-off with China during the monsoon session of Parliament that begins today. The session is also likely to witness heated debates on other key issues like the fallout of the GST, the agrarian crisis and the policy towards Pakistan. Some parties are likely to raise the issue of a ban on sale of cattle for slaughter in animal markets and demand an explanation from the government on it. ""We will try and put the government on the mat and demand answers on some key issues that are posing a threat to thecountry's social harmony,"" a senior opposition leader said. CPI leader D Raja said the opposition ""will seek answers from the government on what they are doing to check rising incidents of cow vigilantism and lynchings in the country that pose grave danger to the social harmony of the country and the idea of India"". The government, on its part, is seeking the cooperation of opposition in getting key legislative business passed and has lined up around two dozen bills in the session. The increased opposition synergy comes at a time when 18 parties have come together under one platform to pin the government on some key issues. The parties came together on the presidential and vice presidential election, but are keen to take the unity further in raising issues in Parliament. A structured meeting within the Congress on the party's strategy in the coming session is slated for today as the session is unlikely to transact much business due to the presidential election. Another joint meeting of opposition leaders is slated the next day for putting in place their strategy for the session. ""The government would want the monsoon session of Parliament to be fruitful and constructive. We will also ensure good coordination and communication with the opposition to help get legislative business passed during the session. ""If the opposition demands a discussion on some current issues, we will discuss the same in the business advisory committee and the chairman will decide the time and date of discussion,"" Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told PTI. Issues like the flood situation particularly in Assam and other northeastern states, violence over Gorkhaland, fallout of demonetisation, job losses and disinvestment of PSUs are also likely to be raised.

**CIC raps Haryana on report on Munna Bhai-style scam in clerk exams** 

 ______ 
In an alleged Munna Bhai-style scam in the examination conducted for ESIC's Lower Division Clerk (LDC) positions in 2009-10 in Haryana, which was first reported by Mail Today in March this year, the CIC has come down heavily on the corporation.

As the appellant RTI activist approached CIC over delay in taking action against the cited cases, the Commission has directed ESIC to be ""headed by a director general to consider the RTI applications of the appellant and this appeal as formal complaint and inform him and the Commission, the action taken within two months from the date of receipt of this order"". The order was pronounced on Monday.

WHAT IS THE CASE?

Gurugram-based RTI activist Harinder Dhingra had alleged initially that several examinees had apparently used proxies to sit for written examination as well as a test in computer skills. He had also provided proof of the matter by getting details through several other RTIs.

""I was shocked to find that signatures on admit cards on the attendance sheet of several successful candidates, who were appointed as LDC in the said exams, were quite different to the signatures of persons who appeared for the said examination on September 20, 2009. To a lay man like me who is not a handwriting expert the difference is quite evident. It is evident that these candidates, appointed LDC in ESIC, were not the ones who appeared for examination,"" Dhingra said.

In a damning observation, the Commission said, ""It is clear from his applications and representations that something is seriously wrong and a kind of mini Vyaapam scandal might have happened in the public authority. The Commission is surprised to know that nothing was initiated to probe this Munna Bhai type of impersonation scandal in spite of detailed RTI requests along with relevant copies in at least 11 cases."" The Commission also directed ESIC to provide the certified copy of the letter written to the Vigilance Department.

With Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu resigning from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet, Smriti Irani was given additional charge of the Information &amp; Broadcast Ministry and Narendra Tomar was made the Minister for Urban Development.

Tomar is currently the Union Minister for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Irani is the incumbent Minister for Textiles. In a Cabinet reshuffle in 2016, both the Union Ministers lost their portfolios. Irani was replaced by Prakash Javedekar as the HRD Minister and Piyush Goyal replaced Tomar and was given additional charge of Minister of Mines.

On Monday, Naidu was picked as the NDA nominee for the vice presidential election in August. The decision to nominate Naidu was taken at the BJP parliamentary party meeting. PM Modi was reportedly not inclined on allowing Naidu to leave his Cabinet. However, Amit Shah pushed his nomination saying the party needs an experienced hand in the Rajya Sabha.

Naidu, who lost his mother when he was 18 months old, reportedly said: ““I feel like I am leaving my mother. BJP has always been a mother to me.”

He was accompanied by PM Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and veteran leaders Murli Manohar Joshi and L K Advani on Tuesday to file his nomination papers at the Parliament. Leaders from the AIADMK, TRS and Shiv Sena were also present when Naidu filed his papers.

**What foreign media is saying about Ram Nath Kovind, India’s Presidential election 2017** 

 ______

Media across the world covered the Presidential Election 2017 for which lawmakers across the country cast their votes on Monday. Almost all reports of the election in foreign media have claimed that NDA’s Ram Nath Kovind is set to defeat opposition’s Meira Kumar. The reports have also highlighted the Dalit status of Kovind and claimed how his election would be symbolic “boost” for PM Narendra Modi, who is trying to “woo Dalit voters.” Some of the reports also noted the recent alleged rise of attacks against Dalits and pointed out that Kovind would be the first President close to the RSS.

The Irish Times reported “the two-candidate contest is likely to be won by Ram Nath Kovind, a 72-year old “low-caste” Dalit and former state governor, who is supported by prime minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).” It also pointed out that Kovind would be the first Indian leader close to “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or National Volunteer Corps, that provides the BJP ‘spiritual and philosophical’ guidance.” On RSS, the report claimed, “RSS believes in keeping Hinduism pure by protecting it from “outside” influences such as Islam and Christianity, and has been accused of stoking religious hatred against Islam.”

Sputnik International said India is “projected” to elect a member of “lowest social rung to the presidency for the second time in history.” It further said that that in India “social caste system has kept a high percentage of the population of the country in abject poverty for thousands of years.” On India’s Dalits, the report says, “A person born a dalit, considered to be outside of the four official social castes that make up Hindu culture in India, is branded from birth as “impure” and is by definition shoved to the periphery of the country’s culture.”

Kovind’s nomination, said Sputnik International, is a part of “what is considered by many to be a long-term play to bring Dalit voters under the wing of the BJP Hindu nationalist.”

UK-based The Telegraph reported India is “set to elect a new president from its Dalit community.” It also claimed that Kovind’s election is “being seen as a way for Mr Modi to gain political capital among the Dalit community, who number around 200 million in the nation of 1.3 billion, and are relegated to the margins of society.”

The Telegraph also notes that Kovind would the first President closely associated with “powerful Hindu revivalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)”.

The Strait Times reported that Kovind has a clear advantage against Kumar. It described Kovind as a “low-profile politician better known for working behind the scenes, belongs to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.” The report says Kovind’s election would be a “boost” for BJP which has been “trying to woo Dalit community.”

Venezuela-based teleSUR said Kovind’s nomination is being seen by Dalit activists as a “calculated move” by NDA to “woo Dalit voters and shed its upper caste image.” The report noted that Kovind’s nomination has “raised eyebrows” of many Dalit activists who see the move as a “ploy to win over Dalit votes.” It claimed that there was an “upsurge” in crimes against Dalits since Modi came to power. It quoted an NCRB report saying 45003 atrocities were recorded against Dalits between 2015-16.

UK-based Metro reported, “India is on the verge of electing a member of the lowest Hindu caste as its president.”

The Nikkei Asian Review reported that most of the Indian lawmakers voted for Kovind, from the Dalit community. It noted, “Some see Kovind’s candidacy as an attempt by BJP to garner Dalit votes and offset criticism of it as a party for higher caste Hindus. Dalit support will be important to Modi when he seeks re-election in 2019 to continue his reform and development programs.”

Germany’s DW.com reported that Indian lawmakers voted on Monday for the country’s next president “in a contest that pits two politicians from the lowest Hindu caste rank that were once known as “untouchables.” It attributed analysts as saying that “Modi is trying to secure Dalit support ahead of critical 2019 general elections.”

The Voice of America said, “A low-caste candidate handpicked by the Bharatiya Janata Party is expected to emerge as India’s new president and seal the grip of Hindu nationalists on power.” On Kovind, it notes that he has “Hindu nationalist roots.” The “bid to catapult him (Kovind) to the nation’s top office is regarded an astute move by the BJP, which repeatedly points to his credentials as a symbol of the country’s low castes.”

Aljazeera said Kovind is predicted to win. “The winner of Monday’s contest will be India’s second president belonging to the Dalit community, after KR Narayanan, who was president between 1997-2002. Dalits, formerly known as “untouchables”, are on the lowest rank of India’s traditional social system based on caste,” it said.

**A concert at sea** 

 ______ 
The critical importance of the rule of law at sea, including the freedom of navigation, is apparent from the same tenets underlying the activities of the three navies and the Malabar exercise. Illustration by C R Sasikumar The critical importance of the rule of law at sea, including the freedom of navigation, is apparent from the same tenets underlying the activities of the three navies and the Malabar exercise. Illustration by C R Sasikumar

On the near horizon, Japan’s largest helicopter destroyer JS Izumo and India’s aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya were engaged in their respective parts of the operation. The sea was calm yet windy. I was on the US aircraft carrier USS Nimitz to attend the ship tour of the trilateral naval exercise, Malabar-17. Right in front of me on the ship board, US Fighters were taking off and landing one after another.

Malabar-17 is the “largest maritime exercise ever conducted in the vast Indian Ocean” as President Donald Trump put it on the occasion of the successful summit meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. Indeed, it is the debut of JS Izumo in an exercise with other navies. It is also the first time that India has fielded an aircraft carrier to Malabar. Sixteen ships, two submarines and more than 95 aircraft are conducting the historic joint exercise in the Bay of Bengal.

It was exactly 10 years ago when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a speech titled “Confluence of the Two Seas” at the Indian Parliament. He stated “the Pacific and the Indian Ocean are now bringing about a dynamic coupling as seas of freedom and of prosperity”.

As he anticipated, the Indo-Pacific region has become the centre of geo-political and geo-economic gravity in a decade. It is blessed with opportunities, encompassing India, ASEAN and Africa with full potential, as well as matured economies like Japan and US. At the same time, this region faces serious challenges including attempts to change the status quo by force, coercion or intimidation, and influx of radical elements, to name a few.

Last summer, Prime Minister Abe launched the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy,” as Japan’s response to such challenges and opportunities. In essence, this strategy regards the Pacific region and the Indian Ocean region as one big strategic domain, and aims to improve inter- and intra- region connectivity and to promote fundamental values such as rule of law. The strategy is also a statement of intent that Japan is ready to play a greater role in the Indian Ocean region with the banner of “Proactive Contribution to Peace.”

It is against this backdrop that JS Izumo and JS Sazanami participate in Malabar-17. The main objective of the exercise is to strengthen inter-operability as well as sharing of best practices between the three navies, but what it demonstrates is something beyond maritime cooperation. It is the expression of unshakeable determination shared by the three democracies to safeguard and solidify a rules-based international order and to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific.

If you take a look at recent joint statements agreed to by the leaders of the three countries, including the most recent one between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump, you will find it evident that “rule of law” is the key phrase emphasised in all statements. The title of Prime Minister Abe’s keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in 2014 was “Japan for the rule of law. Asia for the rule of law. And the rule of law for all of us.” Indeed, ensuring rule of law is critical for the coexistence of big countries and small countries as well as the continued prosperity of future generations.

International law prescribes the order, particularly order governing the seas. Its history is very long, stretching back to the days of ancient Greece. By Roman times, the seas were already kept open to all, with personal possession and partitioning of the sea prohibited. As history moved on, the wisdom and the practical experiences of a great many people involved with the sea, accumulated into common rules. This is what we now know as the international law of the seas. This law was not created by any particular country, nor was it the product of a particular group. Instead, it is the product of our own wisdom, cultivated over a great many years for the well-being and prosperity of all humankind.

The critical importance of the rule of law at sea, including the freedom of navigation, is apparent from the same tenets underlying the activities of the three navies and the Malabar exercise. Japan, India and the US are forces with common values, common vision, and common objectives, closely united to safeguard a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

Malabar-17 is certainly a milestone of such concerted efforts, but we can also say that it only marks the beginning of enhanced trilateral cooperation. Based on the robust outcomes of summit meetings between Prime Minister Modi, President Trump and Prime Minister Abe, we will see more to come, because the benefit of our trilateral partnership is something that not only the people of the three countries but the people of like-minded countries in the region can rely on, in this age of great uncertainty.

**Wanted: DU professors picture with mother at temple is provocative to some in West Bengal** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 DU professor Rakesh Sinha has been named in and FIR for inciting communal tension.

2 Sinha posted a picture with his mother at Mahakal temple that has been termed as provocative.

3 Sinha is a RSS vicharak.

RSS 'vicharak' (thinker) and DU professor Rakesh Sinha is now a wanted man in West Bengal.

Sinha has been booked under various non-bailable sections of the IPC by Kolkata Police. While Sinha termed this a 'strong-arm tactic' to silence his criticism of the Mamata Banerjee regime over communal appeasement and consequent violence in Bashirhat, RSS-affiliated legal body Legal Rights Observatory (LRO) has called for an NIA probe into the role of TMC MLAs in the communal flare-up.

The case, filed on July 12 on a complaint lodged a couple of days prior to that, claims that Sinha tried to incite communal hatred and thus tried to spark communal conflagration in the already disturbed state through his social media posts. A particular post has also been made the basis of the complaint. In a Twitter post, Sinha had posted a picture with his mother offering prayers at the Mahakal Temple in Ujjain on July 9. According to Kolkata lawyer Brajesh Jha, who is representing Sinha, one Manoj Kumar Singh filed the complaint against him, calling his post ""provocative"" that can lead to communal tension and riots.

'MAMATA WANTS TO SILENCE HER OPPONENTS'

""We are moving for anticipatory bail and also planning to sue the complainant,"" Jha said. ""The FIR has been lodged against me in Kolkata without any evidence and registered without any annexture. Mamata Banerjee wants to silence her opponents and this mentality needs to be crushed. Freedom of Expression is under threat and she is using the police and administration as the B-team of TMC,"" Sinha told Mail Today.

""Mamata has now started chasing her critiques outside the state. The FIR mentioned of a photo which incited violence. In the last three months, I have posted three photos: one performing puja at Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain along with my mother; another where the President of India was presenting an award to me; and lastly, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat releasing a book on Narendra Modi. Do these photos incite violence? Mamata is afraid of my research-based criticism of her communal social philosophy,"" he added.

""We condemn the FIR against Rakesh Sinha for exposing the involvement of jihadi radicals of TMC in Basirhat/ Baduria riots. We will legally defeat the lunatic action by the Bengal government,"" LRO convener Vinay Joshi told Mail Today. TMC Leader Derek O'Brian refused to comment on the matter. He instead asked the reporter to mail the query to the media contact mail address of the party.

Besides, if you take concrete steps against militancy and separatism in the Valley, there will be a counter-reaction. If the silent majority is being suppressed by a vocal and rabid minority, it's the State's duty to intervene and enforce national law by eliminating anti-national militants like Burhan Wani or whoever his current successor is.




&gt; Look at the ban on beef, the hooligans which have been allowed a free reign



Ban on beef is nothing new. Heck, it's even a guiding principle in the Constitution. The cow-vigilante groups aren't being given a free reign, and the PM has come out repeatedly against them. Cow-violence is not a new phenomenon, and has been occurring sporadically since pre-independence times, including during UPA rule.





&gt; Or look at the thousands of couples who are regularly harassed on the streets of UP just because they are seen together! 


""thousands of couples."" The Romeo-Squad narrative has been abandoned for Lynchistan, get with the times.



&gt; We are unable to see movies that have progressive content because the CBFC wants to toe the government line in preserving 'our culture'.



And is this a new phenomenon? Heck, CBFC is way more liberal now than before, and is gradually loosening more and more restrictions. 10 years back, a makeout scene would be considered scandalous, today there's one in almost every major movie. By the way, do you know who started the CBFC? Nehru. The guy used to even censor poets critical of him, and even had one arrested. He's also the one who tightened the laws on media freedom, with the aim of shutting down publications critical of his government. Imagine the outrage today!



&gt; The authors cannot publish works which are even remotely critical of the government or Hinduism. 



See my Nehru point above. Plus, just open Scroll.in, Quint, TheWire and the other pro-Opposition websites. The amount of criticism that Modi is facing would be unimaginable in Indira's or Nehru's times! 




&gt;  the point is that never before did we have a government that was so in cahoots with these fringe elements that even their highest official has seemingly lost control of things, 




I disagree with your conclusion. It's based entirely on selective outrage and showcasing of a few crimes, where the criminals should be completely prosecuted. You are implying that this is systematic and deliberate, and this I disagree with. If you want an example of what deliberate political bullying and violence looks like, Lalu's Jungle Raj in cahoots with Shahabuddin is a great example.

If you have to go back 30 years for a different scenario, it should make you question your yardstick in the first place. We don't have to go back 30 years, just 5 or 10 to see how less chaotic the whole situation was. If all you see is that the State is trying to 'enforce' the law by eliminating 'anti-national' militants then it speaks volumes about your ignorance of the situation and naivety in approach than anything else. Kashmir is a state first and foremost, and in an environment in which the people of the State feel terrorized not just by actual terrorists, but their own army is the worst possible situation. The fact that you can speak about it without even touching that aspect means you're better off not broaching the issue at all. The situation there is worse than it has ever been and those are not discussion points, its the situation on the ground mister. 

&gt;ban on beef is nothing new. Heck, it's even a guiding principle in the Constitution. The cow-vigilante groups aren't being given a free reign, and the PM has come out repeatedly against them. Cow-violence is not a new phenomenon, and has been occurring sporadically since pre-independence times, including during UPA rule.

Cow violence was never a national issue at any time in our history than what it is now. Please don't be intentionally obtuse about it. The Constitution only includes the preservation of cow from the standpoint of animal husbandry. Please go and read the Article before wanting to appear knowledgeable on it. The same Constitution also gives its people economic and social liberty. Ever wondered why that is never enforced properly but cow slaughter is? Go figure. Also, do you really feel Modi has done enough to rein in the nefarious elements which have been creating havoc in peoples lives? If yes, then you are the ultimate political subject who is appeased with such minimal effort, like a few words saying 'Its bad'. 

On CBFC, what's the point of stating that who started it? It stands for Certification, not censoring. Something which again you seem to have missed when addressing the issue. Too often has the CBFC tried to tow the popular line that will find resonance with the larger approach of the Central Government. Its not about CBFC being backward, its about the changing role of CBFC as a whole which has forgotten that its there only to certify films, not censor or direct cuts in them. Just recently Amartya Sen had his interview censored by the State because it used words such as 'Hindutva' and 'cow politics'. Are you going to blame that on Nehru too? Maybe you will. 

Speaking of social media, these far right wing elements also have their grip there, where they are regularly searching for anything and everything that can cause them even the most minimal of outrages. Like the recent Snapchat incident involving a group of comedians from Mumbai. 

Your use of the word anti national itself is quite indicative of where you come from and your approach to these issues, which frankly I have no time to engage with because its like bashing one's head against a wall. Your worldview is clouded by propaganda, and you refuse to see things which need more introspection and questioning by you as a reasonable individual first and foremost. Its important to sometimes step aside from your political leanings, and examine them impartially. There is a systematic wave of far right wing elements that are seeking to make inroads into peoples lives, and if there is a reason why you are not seeing this or feigning ignorance of this, you have our own institutions, however brittle they maybe, to thank for. The whole of civil society hasn't lost its way and even the Courts haven't.

**Ahead of privatisation, Air India eyes bumper staff buyout** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Air India is drawing up a proposal to offer voluntary buyouts to just over a third of its 40,000 employees , a senior company official said, one of the largest such offers in India's state sector, as the carrier slashes costs ahead of a 2018 sale.The official, who could not be named as the plans are not public, said the state-owned airline had also put fleet expansion on hold, scrapping a proposal to lease eight Boeing 787 wide-body aircraft. Air India's board approved the proposal in April but nothing further had been done.India's flag carrier is on the block after Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's cabinet last month approved plans to privatise the loss-making airline - selling part or all of the company and ending decades of state support.Founded in the 1930s and known to generations of Indians for its Maharajah mascot, Air India has a complex fleet, too many staff relative to its peers and $8.5 billion in debt. Since 2012, New Delhi has injected $3.6 billion to keep it afloat.An official in Modi's office said the leader, under pressure to cut spending and boost basic infrastructure like ports and roads, is in ""no mood"" to provide fresh monetary assistance to any loss-making public sector company The official said that top bureaucrats in the civil aviation ministry and at Air India had been asked to present a report on how a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) could be offered to about 15,000 of Air India's 40,000 staffers, including contractors.""Nothing has been finalised but our aim is to make the strategic sale as simple as we can,"" said a second top official in New Delhi, involved in the airline's daily operations, adding that any fresh investments would be put on hold.Previous attempts to offload the airline have failed mainly because of the scale and complexity of problems at Air India, as well as its influential unions.If Modi can pull the privatisation off, it will buttress his credentials as a reformer brave enough to wade into some of the country's most intractable problems.In its heyday, Air India boasted of a talent pool that newly founded airlines dipped into.The government will, however, need to convince seven trade unions to accept the plan to make the company attractive to potential buyers, including buyouts and other efforts to slash costs. Their initial response was not positive.""The government will propose a VRS scheme and we will throw their proposal in the dustbin,"" said J.B. Kadian, leader of a union that represents 8,000 non-technical staff of Air India.Kadian said a joint forum of unions representing Air India employees will launch ""an agitation"" in August if the government pursues its plans to privatise the national carrier.A committee of five senior federal ministers, led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to meet this month and begin ironing out the finer details of the privatisation plan.In the meantime, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said he wants Air India to begin cutting at all levels.Earlier this month, the airline decided to stop serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class on domestic flights, in a bid to save up to 100 million rupees ($1.6 million) over 10 months.The action provoked uproar on social media and was belittled by aviation experts, who argue Air India management needs a massive structural overhaul, tackling thornier issues like fleet and staff, not meals.The airline is also working to reduce the time its planes are not flying and launching direct flights to new international destinations. In July, Air India started a direct flight to Washington. It will start flying to Stockholm, Copenhagen and Los Angeles later this year.""Keeping planes in the hangar makes no sense when Air India is trying find new sources of income. We should optimize the use of all possible resources,"" Raju said.""The idea is to present a robust company to potential buyers,"" the minister said.

**China Tells Foreign Diplomats Its Patience With India 'Won't Be Indefinite'** 

 ______ 
In border stand-off with China, Beijing tells foreign envoys patience with
India ""won't be indefinite""

**New Delhi: **

With the border dispute at Sikkim extending beyond a month, China last week
told foreign diplomats in Beijing that its ""patience with India won't be
indefinite"". Sharing details of this, diplomat sources who asked not to be
named said that India has been briefing foreign embassies in Delhi on the
border stand-off upon their request. The Foreign Ministry has repeated at
these briefings what it has said on record - that

diplomatic contacts are also being used to help defuse the tension.

Though the government has told foreign diplomats there is no cause for alarm,
sources admit that the confrontation at Sikkim is causing concern in capitals
around the world.

China's version of the dispute is that India has ""illegally transgressed"" the
border at Sikkim to stop a road from being built on a plateau in what it calls
the Donglang region. India agrees with Bhutan's claim that the land belongs
not to China, but to the small Himalayan kingdom. Before the confrontation
escalated, India had also warned China that the road in what Bhutan and India
call Dokalam was ""a serious security concern"" because it gives China access to
the ""Chicken's Neck"" , a narrow wedge of land, 23 kms at its widest, which
links the seven northeastern states to the rest of India.

Indian soldiers reportedly stopped the Chinese road's construction early in
June. Beijing's rhetoric has been fierce and repeated, with warnings from
government spokespersons and state-run media of ""more serious consequences""
for India and references to the 1962 war fought over Arunachal Pradesh which
had punishing results for Delhi.

Amid the stand-off with India, Chinese President Xi Jinping met Prime Minister
Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany.

Beijing aggressively stated there was no bilateral or formal meeting

Wanted: DU professor's picture with mother at temple is 'provocative' to some in West Bengal

In the 'provocative' Twitter post Sinha had posted a picture with his mother offering prayers at the Mahakal Temple in Ujjain on July 9.

RSS vicharak (thinker) and DU professor Rakesh Sinha is now a wanted man in West Bengal.

Sinha has been booked under various non-bailable sections of the IPC by Kolkata Police. While Sinha termed this a 'strong-arm tactic' to silence his criticism of the Mamata Banerjee regime over communal appeasement and consequent violence in Bashirhat, RSS-affiliated legal body Legal Rights Observatory (LRO) has called for an NIA probe into the role of TMC MLAs in the communal flare-up.

The case, filed on July 12 on a complaint lodged a couple of days prior to that, claims that Sinha tried to incite communal hatred and thus tried to spark communal conflagration in the already disturbed state through his social media posts. A particular post has also been made the basis of the complaint. In a Twitter post, Sinha had posted a picture with his mother offering prayers at the Mahakal Temple in Ujjain on July 9. According to Kolkata lawyer Brajesh Jha, who is representing Sinha, one Manoj Kumar Singh filed the complaint against him, calling his post ""provocative"" that can lead to communal tension and riots.

'MAMATA WANTS TO SILENCE HER OPPONENTS'

""We are moving for anticipatory bail and also planning to sue the complainant,"" Jha said. ""The FIR has been lodged against me in Kolkata without any evidence and registered without any annexture. Mamata Banerjee wants to silence her opponents and this mentality needs to be crushed. Freedom of Expression is under threat and she is using the police and administration as the B-team of TMC,"" Sinha told Mail Today.

""Mamata has now started chasing her critiques outside the state. The FIR mentioned of a photo which incited violence. In the last three months, I have posted three photos: one performing puja at Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain along with my mother; another where the President of India was presenting an award to me; and lastly, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat releasing a book on Narendra Modi. Do these photos incite violence? Mamata is afraid of my research-based criticism of her communal social philosophy,"" he added.

""We condemn the FIR against Rakesh Sinha for exposing the involvement of jihadi radicals of TMC in Basirhat/ Baduria riots. We will legally defeat the lunatic action by the Bengal government,"" LRO convener Vinay Joshi told Mail Today. TMC Leader Derek O'Brian refused to comment on the matter. He instead asked the reporter to mail the query to the media contact mail address of the party.

When did I say it did? The wiki was just used to disprove your claim that cow violence is a new phenomenon under Modi. It's not, and was a lot more prevalent and bigger in scale in the past. Did you read this:



&gt;&gt; According to a June 2017 Reuters report, citing a data journalism website, a total of ""28 Indians – 24 of them Muslims – have been killed and 124 injured since 2010 in cow-related violence"".

Sure it has, but that's nothing new. That's been the case since the agency's inception.









&gt; I don't believe an impartial investigation was conducted into the gunning down of the said militant.


Are you genuinely asking whether the former commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen was a militant? That's like asking whether an impartial investigation was conducted before the strike on Osama bin Laden. 




&gt; Is someone in Kashmir who is dissatisfied with the Central Government automatically a militant? If that is the case, will you as a city dweller be branded as a militant too if you decide to raise your voice against the Government about something that concerns you? 



Again, when exactly did I imply that? I merely called the commander of an militant and separatist group an anti-national, which btw is also internationally recognised as a terrorism group. Plus, the group is openly pro-Pakistan and anti-India, and enjoys great links with Jamaat-e-Islami and ISI.



&gt; . So again, please read up more before forming an opinion about these things. They are not science, so its foolish to cling to something you are convinced is the truth.



Just, wow. At this point, I really hope you didn't know who Burhan Wani was. Otherwise you have been blinded by propaganda.

**Nepalis, saddled with banned Indian demonetised notes, risk losing savings** 

 ______ 
Kathmandu: Nepalis stand to lose millions of dollars held in high-value currency notes that India banned last year and has yet to exchange, a Nepali central bank official said on Tuesday.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November banned Rs500 ($7.77) and Rs1,000 rupee notes as part of a drive against unaccounted wealth in India that has also hit Nepal where Indian rupees are widely used.

More From Livemint »

People holding the notes in India were given a little less than two months to exchange them at banks.

In March, officials from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) visited Nepal and promised to allow every Nepali citizen to exchange Rs4,500 ($70) worth of the old notes for new ones.

“That was only a verbal assurance but no formal decision from India has come to us,” said Chinta Mani Shivakoti, a deputy governor of the central Nepal Rastra Bank.

“Even if this amount was exchanged, individuals holding more than Rs4,500 risk losing the excess,” Shivakoti said.

Nepal depends heavily on funds from workers in India, who sent home $640 million in 2016, or about 3% of its gross domestic product (GDP).

The Indian central bank declined to comment. An Indian finance ministry spokesman also declined to comment, saying it was a central bank matter.

India fears that if it agrees to Nepal’s demand to allow Nepalis to exchange unlimited amounts, a large number of Indians may launder their ill-gotten old notes through Nepal.

Shivakoti said Nepal’s banks hold Rs7.85 crore worth of the old notes, while business officials estimate that up to Rs1,000 crore in old currency ($155 million) may be held by individuals in Nepal’s informal sector.

Another NRB official, Bhisma Raj Dhungana, said the delay in resolving the issue was causing concern.

“India should have allowed the exchange facility much earlier,” Dhungana said.

Ordinary Nepalis say they have been hit badly by the delay.

“My savings are worth no more than waste papers. I can’t do anything about it,” said Saila Thakuri, who has Rs8,000 in old notes sent by his son who works in a restaurant in New Delhi. Reuters

**Now, MARCOS helping Army flush out terrorists in Kashmir** 

 ______ 
The Indian Army is carrying out an extensive drive against terrorists in Kashmir and now even involving Marine commandos (MARCOS) for clearing them out from the islands in the Jhelum river.

The Navy has deployed a team of 30 Marine commandos, under a Lieutenant Commander, permanently in the Wular Lake to prevent any terrorist activity there.

During a recent search and destroy operation in the Jhelum river, Army had also used the services of the MARCOS to flush out any terrorists who could be using that location for hiding from the forces.

In recent times, the Army has been going out in far-flung areas to trace terrorists who are already under pressure from security forces due to relentless counter-terrorist operations.

The team of MARCOS is working alongside 5 Rashtriya Rifles deployed in Kashmir's Watlab area near Wular lake. Army sources said the highlands in Jhelum have a certain type of plantation which can be used by the terrorists to hide them and their equipment.

The MARCOS have the capability to dive underwater and carry out extensive searches in these areas.

381,"&gt; Most people who oppose it do it because it's Modi's pet project.

I think you maybe correct esp with regards to this particular user in question here. He seems quite radically anti-Modi and that maybe why his arguments are so angry on this.  

It doesn't even make sense in consistency. Many of the Corridor HSR's feasibility studies were commissioned under previous Govt. 

Its sad really. There is so much research on HSR out there (my linked comment lists only some of them) that its overwhelming.  

HSR is the future and it makes so much sense that people who oppose it now aren't even going to be found in coming decades because no one would out themselves for having being on the wrong side of history and by such margins at that too.  

Currently this guy is on the 1000 KM tirade over transit lengths of the projects and 35 trips to the 100 suggested by his beloved IIM study.  

He forgets (and on top didn't read the links mentioned because its clearly public data that my comment has linked for easy access-though it does require a bit of effort to go through them, that majority of rail transport in India is in the 200-300Km range) that these HSR (like Mum-Ahd) are not having 2 stations. Origin and Destination and that is it. That makes 0 sense.  

Mum-Ahm has 11.  
Not everyone is going to be doing the entirety of 550 Kms. What about people who want to transit to and from Mum-Surat or Surat-Ahm. This is around 250KMs or so. There are even more stations in between (obviously not that level of current Indian rail, which would be unfeasible for HSR because if there are too many it would be constantly stopping and starting).  
And this works because of the population density of even these intermediate stations/zones. This is why India is unique and why HSR is so perfect for India.  

And Japanese feasibility study says by 2050 there will be 120-130 Trains Per Day Per Direction. This is well over the so called IIM report which was just such a poor document when it came out, it was disappointing having people from such premier institute writing such poorly researched arguments.

While at the same time they oppose time tested and widely available and useful tech like HSR/bullet train. 

I see some of the arguments here which tells me some are US based NRIs who eat up the usual propaganda about infrastructure spending and debt without understanding how debt works. Not all debt is bad and infrastructure projects require govt take up debt. 

The major giveaway is their argument in support of air travel of HSR. Air travel is suitable for US because its a huge country with various islands of high density areas. HSR is suitable for Western Europe, India and Eastern China because population density is high and the distance between the population cluster is not huge compared to say US. Even in US, the North-east areas, California coast is actually well suitable for HSR. 

But I feel hopeful because unlike US where HSR opposers are in power, vast majority of Indian people actually do support infrastructure projects be it metro, bullet train etc.

If we are making the same argument about India being poor for bullet trains not realizing that we see the same arguments regarding India's space program. But both investments are worth it for the tech and manufacturing India will gain. Already the push for metros in various cities has led to increased manufacturing of metro coaches and related ancillary facilities by Alstom, Bombardier etc. 

Also this HSR/bullet train is actually not just a Modi project. ABVP wanted it and initiated preliminary discussions, MMS was the one who actually worked with Japanese and French officials to actually formalize the process of bringing the tech in India and Modi is aiming to lay the foundation stone. 

So despite the very partisan slug-fest, things like space research, nuclear tech and infrastructure has more or less bi-partisan approach.  ",2017-07-19 01:33:36

**Smriti Irani to take charge as I&amp;B minister, Narendra Singh Tomar gets urban development** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: Textile minister Smriti Zubin Irani has been given the additional charge of information and broadcasting (I&amp;B), after M. Venkaiah Naidu resigned from the post on Tuesday, following his nomination as National Democratic Alliance’s vice-presidential candidate.

Naidu was holding the portfolio since July 2016 in addition to urban development, housing and poverty alleviation ministry. Narendra Singh Tomar was given the charge of urban development ministry, according to a post on micro-blogging platform Twitter by the Prime Minister’s office.

More From Livemint »

Prior to textile ministry, Irani held the human resource development ministry. A former television actor and producer, Irani was appointed as Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) vice-president in 2012.

Irani’s appointment comes at a time when the I&amp;B ministry is in the process of revamping the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) or Censor Board with a new Cinematograph Act.

CBFC, constituted under the Cinematograph Act 1952, reviews and certifies films for public exhibition. Naidu had time and again reiterated that the ministry is working on a draft on the lines of a report submitted by a committee headed by the veteran filmmaker Shyam Benegal in April 2016.

The ministry is also planning to formulate a national communication policy in a bid to enhance access and dissemination of information across the country.

Irani will be the fourth I&amp;B minister appointed in the three years of Narendra Modi-led NDA government. Between 2014 and 2016, Prakash Javadekar held the portfolio, followed by finance minister Arun Jaitley. In a cabinet reshuffle in 2016, Naidu had assumed the charge of I&amp;B ministry.

392,"China and India shouldn't and mustn't be compared.


 First and foremost reason is to see how long these countries have been in existence. India was unified relatively very late in 1947 however China has been unified for a long period of time under Ming, Qing etc. rule. However India is just a collection of 500 or so princely States and the infighting and distrust between these stats even now has undermined central rule and country is quite diverse in nature. However China is relatively uniform with same language being spoken in entire country and same religion, beliefs etc. This inturn reduces central workload and this greatly increases its productivity.

China is a communist country. You never know who becomes the president. However if a good person becomes the president he has far greater powers to enact reforms and China has been lucky with that. Also any form of student is severely crushed and people are killed for opposing current regime. Compare that to us, no one gives a damn on what you do. Recently a Chinese noble prize winner died in prison due to lack of proper medication. He was in prison for opposing the rule. There are numerous cases. See what they had done in 1999. I feel lucky to be in Democratic country.

Continuation of above point, due to communist country they punishment any criminals be it on corruption, murder etc. by death. Compare that to us where even if deadly terrorists are hanged, people go streets opposing the government. The point I want to make is they have strict rules and implementation is strict. So if any rules are enacted you just expect majority of population to follow it but that's not the case here. The amount of hate Modi gets here, if it were China randia, by now, must have reached 0 subscribers. Mind you Google and Facebook are banned there. Domestic companies are heavily preferred and given special privileges there. Not here, no one recognizes or heritage. Chinese is spoken everywhere around the country and is there native language. But we are always shameful while talking in Hindi Infront of strangers. I think we should accept Hindi as our national heritage alongside with our mother tongue.

China has been historically dominating the world. Had it not been the decision of some rule to stop building ships we might have been seeing China as the great world power. Great emphasis on education, art, literature has always been there in China. Trade routes were so improved and important that Europeans majority of import came from China and Magellan and his team went on voyage just to discover shorter path to China. India has never been a global power before. It's always been regional power struggle here. They promote win-win there, we promote win-lose here. Half of our energy is spent in trying to sabotage others. 

Mindset also plays a role. Everyone here is engineer or doctor and anything other is just not accepted. However that's isn't the case there. Research, sports, business are just as lucrative options as any other option.

Good sense prevails, Mumbai Police to drop FIR against AIB



Comedy group AIB circulated the meme across social media platforms

The Mumbai Police seem to have realised their mistake in rushing to act against comedy group AIB for the now infamous meme on Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Snapchat 'dog filter'. mid-day has learnt from the top brass that the Cyber police are most likely to file a C Summary in court that will nullify the FIR.



The case against AIB will be nullified if the cops file a C Summary

The controversy blew up last week, after AIB tweeted a picture of a doppelganger of Modi looking at his mobile phone at a railway station alongside a photo of the PM on which a 'dog filter' was superimposed from the Snapchat app.

Also read - Narendra Modi's lookalike MP Ramchandran reacts to AIB's 'humiliating' Snapchat post

The city cops were flooded with complaints from across the country, after one of the Twitterati, Reetesh Maheshwari, tagged the Mumbai

Police and demanding that strict action be taken against AIB for the ""disrespectful"" joke directed at the PM.

The police took suo motu action and, on Friday, lodged an FIR against the Twitter handle administrator of AIB under Section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.

Also read - Joke on Narendra Modi: Mysterious ways of Mumbai police officials

The cops had said that the picture shared by AIB was fully morphed and it looked like PM Modi, hence it was defamatory. A crime branch officer had earlier said that they registered the FIR after taking legal advice from an expert, who said that prima facie, the act amounted to a cognisable offence.

Also read: FIR against AIB for tweeting Narendra Modi photo with the dog filter

The police's move to file an FIR met with backlash from several people, including music composer Vishal Dadlani, who extended support to AIB. Few netizens also cited examples of sexual offence cases and criticised the cops for not showing the same speedy action in those cases.

The charges

Section 500 (defamation) of IPC, Section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of IT Act

What is C Summary?

It is filed when an error is made in facts while filing a criminal complaint. Once it is filed in court, it puts an end to the case altogether.

407,"Um, I dont think you have been in a research facility to know what the exact issues are op. 

I am a post grad in biotechnologist with around 3 years of research exp in india and 5+ peer reviewed publications. I quit my phd when I had about 6 - 9 months of work left for its completion because - I did not want to die/commit suicide.

Although I could support your grouse to an extent while also adding my own points.

Scientists are not exactly to be left scott free.

1. My scientists bothered more about who I talked to and other personal matters and used that to harass me for most part of my research term with confident admissions of the same. I had to go an entire year not talking to a single girl in public life for the harassment to reduce. Apperrently, doing so would reduce my efficiency.

2. My attempt to leave abroad was seen in negative light and was abused/harrased even further.

3. I used to be relatively proactive in writing publications, (with respect to other peers), so was my team - but my publications had authors added who had little to do with the research because my scientists were following ""mutual understanding and benefit"" - scientist 1 adds 2, 3,4's names and vice versa in their publications - everyone gets more papers on their cv. Cos fuck the student, right? 

4. I was sidelined in my own research work to favour other people who have ""contacts"" or ""access to other labs"". 

5. I was yelled at most, because I did not put enough time on projects/publications that were not a part of my main objective - so although I had major contributions but got second fiddle authorships. It was equivalent to you bulding a whole house but your colluege fixes the gate, so he is given higher priority to you.

6. When institute ran out of funds, I was told to work for free for 6months to 1 year because my parents were, ""maaldaar party"" - my parents are uppermiddle class, under lot of debt and have their other child to educate and take care of.

7. Even today, I need to have a lawyer ready so that they do not fuck me over too much.

8. There is no one to report to - authorities always take the side of their employees and not students, as you can always find a new student but employees are permanent.

9. Scientific research is the single most notorious place where human rights abuse is completely overlooked and students cant do anything about it - they did not come for the money, they need the degree and publications - those are the real currencies. If they lose reputation or references, life becomes 100 times harder for an individual. So one has to get groceries or park cars and hope your scientists dont rage and fuck your life over. This does not happen abroad in most cases. 

10. Mostly, scientists, even those who have post docs from abroad, care nothing about what real challenges for india they are solving - they are only thinking of building their profile and cv, and position to move to better labs, even when they have permanent positions. 

These types of situations are pandemic in indian science scene. Ofcourse you'll find better humans but usually, because there is no one looking or monitoring, you are literally at your scientists'mercy.

They will behave very nice until you join them. Then it's purposeless torture.


**Now, all that being said the science scene is not as bleek as you see on media**.

1. There are very talented people working on most fields, and scientists are challenged with lack of forward initiative - most govent policies are vague and slow.

2. Most tech we use is always 10+ years old. Like forexample, we still manually extract dna/rna for gene expression but most labs in developed labs have automated all of for quite a while now. The view of developed nations is that researchers have to apply their minds and bother less with manual labour. In india we still mix cement and sand manually. 

3. There are several initiatives like wellcome, birac, csir-srf, etc but all of it fails miserably in implementation. All the big agencies are just acting as funding agencies, which is very easy (just sign a cheque) but their main role is to build the right initiatives. I have personally met scientists at conferences who have solved age old industry issues in a matter of weeks, but industries won't buy the tech, ""cos hum bik jaenge"" . So you have tech that can solve a lot issues faster and maybe even cheaper and better lying in scientists labs and the real world still using older caveman methods.

4. Within a few years of my research tenure in india I have seen several ramalingam fellows ( they are indian scientists given fellowships to come back to india to do research from abroad) go back to their adopted countires and labs, like NIH with open arms - because getting anything done in india labs was hurculean. Even fellow jelous scientists pose massive impediments, while buying an incubator is  a 3-6months process even if you are cash rich. 

5. A lot of research labs are headless - so was mine. They have acting directors (directors of other insititues taking additional charge for extra bucks) but they never take major decisions, just sign usual purchase orders or leave forms. So for every insititue without a director you can be assured that they are mostly wallowing in stagnation. Very rarely they can get some big development or purchase.

6. There is no sense of urgency or high quality in research - most management are feeling satisfied in their places and know they just have to ""talk a little science"", get salaries and leave home. 

7. **The biggest lie you are told is "" join the system to change the system"". - once you join the system, you have to get hearded or get controversially kicked out.**

8. Even our current sci-tech minister visited our institute and modi talked about research of our labs in the parliament, but that ammounts to nothing but PR excercise.  Now he heads cow urine forums for PR again - idiot was chief minister candidate of Delhi from bjp and a doctor I think. 

9. Our scientists and students are actually doing the best research possible with their resources available. 

In conclusion, scientist need to treat their students like humans and future assets. Scientists need to be given more freedom and ability to advance technology of their labs. Institutes must be given more forward mobility and not be forced to stagnate. 

And its not exactly about the money - Indian science has been given shit load of money, but its the environment at every level that needs a Renaissance. 

So your argument is more off the mark by a kilometer, but sentiments and basic features can be acknowledged.",2017-07-19 16:41:59
408,"&gt;And about conflating religion and science, of course I believe that science has nothing to do with religion. But religion has to do with the division of resources in our country, the same resources that could be used for science and that is what I am angry with.

 

And what would these be? Taxes on Temples garner 1000’s of crores in revenue for the state (I am sorry, I don’t have precise figures for these, but considering Tirupathi alone has been estimated with a tax burden of Rs 100 crores on account of GST, I am extrapolating+endowment revenues). Our religious subsidies are primarily Hajj and providing security (gratis) to a whole host of Hindu piligrimages, all totalling about Rs 2,000 crores (a rounding error when it comes to our national budget). What are these resources religion is dividing exactly?

 

&gt;Of course these rants are non sensical. That doesn't mean that they don't have a sway over the large part of the population.


And why does belief in Gau mutra preclude a belief in science? This is not Christianity which held anti science beliefs. You could believe in the curative powers of Gau mutra and still be a normal, functioning member of our society. The royal family in Britain believe deeply in Homeopathy…Britain has spent billions on homeopathy research…so? Does it mean Britain as a country is backwards?

 

I fail to make the connection OP and by extension you are making. A population can have whatever beliefs it wants, why is it relevant to the direction a country is taking in R&amp;D? China and Chinese are deeply superstitious, I have myself been inside lifts in govt buildings where they don’t even have a 4th and 14th floor (I was told that 4 apparently rhymes with death or something), their country consumes crazy amounts of bones of endangered animals. Rhino’s have been driven to near extinction because of a Chinese belief that it cures everything from STD’s to fever. [In fact there is a stark rise in the killing of Rhinos in recent years, all to feed an ever growing Chinese market). The worst thing is the whole “rhino horn being made of rich material” is false and dates back to 15th century traditional Chinese manuals! Likewise, the Chinese believe in a whole host of their own “gau mutra” type idiosyncrasies. It is not a function of religion, but how rural and impoverished a populace is.

 

&gt;Of course not. But they are the same people in positions of power that support the scientific complex in India. In an ideal world, science would be driven by curiosity alone. Sadly, we don't live in an ideal world, and science needs political and economic resources for its progress. The same people in positions of power are in charge of these resources and thus are responsible for a regressive attitude towards the sciences.

 

And funding for R&amp;D increased by almost 40% under Vajpayee, Manmohan bumped it up another 30 odd %. Modi has taken it from from 0.82% of the GDP in 2013 to 0.89% in 2016.

 

I see continuity, I see that our politicians, despite their posturing and campaign speeches blah blah are driving up R&amp;D spending. Likewise, if you chart a trajectory of our renewables growth, it has been exponential! Ofc, the narrative is “Mudi once made a comment on environment, is a climate change denier and a religious Hindu” hence all the objective reality on the ground is meaningless!  The JRF amounts were increased from 16k to 25k and SRF from 18k to 28k. Now, you could argue that this is not enough, and we could debate that, but to make a blanket claim that there is a regressive attitude towards sciences has literally no basis in reality. The global average in research to GDP has been around the 2.2-2.4% region, but we are on an upward trajectory. If we take the same rate of growth we have seen since 2000, we should reach the 1.5% mark in the next decade. With a larger economy, an increased percentage would mean an exponentially greater amount in real money terms.

 

&gt;I'm sorry, but you know nothing about my upbringing or background and to make a stark statement is to make an argument against my character, rather than focus on the substance of my argument. Please keep this discussion on-topic.

 

But this is highly relevant – just by virtue of having studied in an English medium school, and having the ability to emigrate abroad to pursue a career in the sciences puts you in the proverbial 1%. The 95% are either barely fed or struggling for the basics, basics we take for granted – food, water, education, a stable upbringing free of violence and a whole host of things. I as an Indian push for improvements in basic primary education and health care (and I do my bit for the former mind you, not just an armchair warrior), we need roads, we need railways, we need power (a whole lot of this), 3 sq meals a day and decent, let alone quality primary education. What makes me angry is how myopic governments (both centre and state, only two exceptions being MP and Maharashtra) are towards areas like water management or scientific agriculture. Science and R&amp;D honestly is not even on my radar. I also know that as we develop, unless we get a truly retarded govt, the budgets of the govt will rise with the development I also know that as our private sector firms grow, they will invest more, as repeated ad-nauseum, money drives innovation, money drives science. A half starving population is really not going to be the hotbed of innovation or cutting edge tech.

 

&gt;Nope, I just mean that next time someone wants to spend 530 million USD on a statue of a historical figure, we should protest the people building the statue, rather than protest the people like OP, who are angry at the politicians.

I honestly don’t care for a stupid statue eitherways, but this is $ 500 million ammortised over iirc half a decade. Also, the place is not just a statue but is expected to have a full fledged tourist eco system. Now will it fail miserably, or succeed, I honestly can’t say, but again, monuments are used as tourist traps drawing in millions in revenue. That said, I personally think this is a retarded and stupid idea. That $ 500 million SHOULD have been better used in sprucing up existing monuments. Also personally I doubt the ROI claims the govt of Guj is making, I mean even the Taj only pulls in Rs 150 crores in revenues a year, I doubt that a statue in some random part of Gujarat is going to top this.",2017-07-19 18:31:33
409,"they replied to the guy five minutes, after he tweeted his hurt feelings at midnight, and promised to take action. All those complaints came after his tweet.

I agree, we should have clearly defined laws giving actual freedom of speech. You're saying tweeting a photo of Modi with dog ears is obscenity? Some people fight for free speech through activism while  some comedians fight for it by pushing the boundaries with their content.",2017-07-19 19:06:30
410,"&gt; And what would these be? Taxes on Temples garner 1000’s of crores in revenue for the state (I am sorry, I don’t have precise figures for these, but considering Tirupathi alone has been estimated with a tax burden of Rs 100 crores on account of GST, I am extrapolating+endowment revenues). Our religious subsidies are primarily Hajj and providing security (gratis) to a whole host of Hindu piligrimages, all totalling about Rs 2,000 crores (a rounding error when it comes to our national budget). What are these resources religion is dividing exactly?

So later in your argument, you say that you do not agree with the statue being built. That is the misallocation of resources that I talking about, not the obviously good things like tourism. Religion generates a net surplus in income, but remember a large amount of religious money is held in private trusts, which receive subsidies from the government and reinvest the money back into religious activities, thus not really helping society outside of the religious realm.

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/special-report/religion-huge-money-spinner-in-india/articleshow/2964677.cms

Also your argument about taxes is void. According to the Income Tax of India, 1961, all religious trusts are free from paying taxes. All income that they earn goes back into private hands.

&gt; And why does belief in Gau mutra preclude a belief in science? This is not Christianity which held anti science beliefs. You could believe in the curative powers of Gau mutra and still be a normal, functioning member of our society. The royal family in Britain believe deeply in Homeopathy…Britain has spent billions on homeopathy research…so? Does it mean Britain as a country is backwards?

You sound highly bigoted here. Neither Hinduism nor Christianity are more backward than the other in theory, it is only in practice when the backwardness arises.

Where are your figures for the homeopathy research? I highly doubt that Britain as a nation has spent billions on something that is scientifically proven not to work.

&gt; I fail to make the connection OP and by extension you are making. A population can have whatever beliefs it wants, why is it relevant to the direction a country is taking in R&amp;D? China and Chinese are deeply superstitious, I have myself been inside lifts in govt buildings where they don’t even have a 4th and 14th floor (I was told that 4 apparently rhymes with death or something), their country consumes crazy amounts of bones of endangered animals. Rhino’s have been driven to near extinction because of a Chinese belief that it cures everything from STD’s to fever. [In fact there is a stark rise in the killing of Rhinos in recent years, all to feed an ever growing Chinese market). The worst thing is the whole “rhino horn being made of rich material” is false and dates back to 15th century traditional Chinese manuals! Likewise, the Chinese believe in a whole host of their own “gau mutra” type idiosyncrasies. It is not a function of religion, but how rural and impoverished a populace is.

You do not understand the crux of my argument. I will do a comparative analysis between India and China for your benefit, since you take the Chinese example. 

China, as a state, does not have religious policies. China, as a state, believes solely in the betterment of the nation even at the cost of peoples' short term happiness. This allows China to do what is objectively good for the nation, invest in R&amp;D, infrastructure projects
and general nation building activities. Whatever religious sentiment is in the nation, is purely in private hands. That is not the action of China as a state.

India, is a democracy and secular nation, which believes in the concept of religion and its free practice. So when let's say, a vote is about to happen, politicians come out to appease the voters, so they will say, build a temple that year rather than the school they were planning to. This is the connection between Church and State in India.

Now you may think that this is a small deal, but it has macroeconomic effects. Here, another article by some of the top business leaders of the country decrying the rise of Hindu Nationalism.

http://time.com/4096102/india-business-religious-intolerance/

At no point do I decry religion as being the harbinger of doom. But it has both positive and negative effects on the nation and religions effects on the sciences when they are tangled together through the centuries, have been to oppress objective research.

This is not the relationship between religion and science in India as they are not very directly related. But religion directs the national consciousness' attention away from the sciences.

&gt; And funding for R&amp;D increased by almost 40% under Vajpayee, Manmohan bumped it up another 30 odd %. Modi has taken it from from 0.82% of the GDP in 2013 to 0.89% in 2016.

Literally where are you getting the numbers about Manmohan and Vajpayee from?

And if you are aware of the R&amp;D macroeconomic variable, it is vastly different from research funding for the sciences, so your numbers here are moot. 

It includes industries built for textiles, handicrafts etc. but the context of this argument is for the sciences. I agree that the government is doing a great job in terms for infrastructure development but we would deviate from the argument here then.

https://thewire.in/105887/research-budget-biotech-iiser/

&gt; The space department, which will aim for the Moon for a second time in 2018, got Rs 9,093.71, a 21% hike. But the Ministry of Earth Sciences, which is engaged in climate-change research, received only Rs 9,093.71 crore, a paltry hike of 2.8%. The DAE received Rs 12,461.2 crores, a hike of 6.6%; and the DST, Rs 4,817.27 crore, a hike of 7.7%.

&gt; “Such announcements from the highest quarter constantly give hope to scientists, about possible increased allocation to S&amp;T sectors. However, when the budget allocation comes, every year scientists get disillusioned as we get to know the actual distributions,” Krishna Ganesh, director of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, told The Wire.

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/india-needs-to-budget-for-research-funding/articleshow/56904031.cms

If you read this article, it espouses a very important point that I am trying to make.

You say that only developed nations spend on science. But it is even more important for developing nations to break the cycle of viciousness that comes with not investing in science early enough, because scientific progress has time and again been shown to break the cycle of poverty via wealth creation.


&gt; I see continuity, I see that our politicians, despite their posturing and campaign speeches blah blah are driving up R&amp;D spending. Likewise, if you chart a trajectory of our renewables growth, it has been exponential!

Now, you could argue that this is not enough, and we could debate that, but to make a blanket claim that there is a regressive attitude towards sciences has literally no basis in reality. The global average in research to GDP has been around the 2.2-2.4% region, but we are on an upward trajectory. If we take the same rate of growth we have seen since 2000, we should reach the 1.5% mark in the next decade. With a larger economy, an increased percentage would mean an exponentially greater amount in real money terms.

Sure, but you deviate from the argument which is about the pure sciences. I love the nation and can extol the virtues of how much development has been done in the last 20 years for hours, but I think we are specifically talking about the pure sciences.

I know your sentiment is to restore Indian image to show that we are doing fine as a developing nation, and we are doing fine. *We can always do better*, is all I am trying to say.

&gt; But this is highly relevant – just by virtue of having studied in an English medium school, and having the ability to emigrate abroad to pursue a career in the sciences puts you in the proverbial 1%.

Sure, these are valid assumptions, but they don't perfectly apply in this case. Feel free to PM me if you would like to know more.

&gt; I as an Indian push for improvements in basic primary education and health care (and I do my bit for the former mind you, not just an armchair warrior), we need roads, we need railways, we need power (a whole lot of this), 3 sq meals a day and decent, let alone quality primary education. What makes me angry is how myopic governments (both centre and state, only two exceptions being MP and Maharashtra) are towards areas like water management or scientific agriculture. Science and R&amp;D honestly is not even on my radar. I also know that as we develop, unless we get a truly retarded govt, the budgets of the govt will rise with the development I also know that as our private sector firms grow, they will invest more, as repeated ad-nauseum, money drives innovation, money drives science. A half starving population is really not going to be the hotbed of innovation or cutting edge tech.

Of course! Feeding a population is more important than anything else. But we lose track of the long term in sight of the short term. By constantly pushing for semi permanent solutions that don't push for upliftment from poverty rather than mere alleviation, we just push off the problem till tomorrow.

Scientific research allows development of areas where a nation can have niche knowledge, a competitive edge, which allows for wealth and job creation. This is part of a much larger picture than in the course of our lifetimes.

412,"MUMBAI –  Until recently, truck driver K Shaji often waited for hours at various checkpoints to pay state taxes on his cargo as he journeyed from India's south to the country's financial capital, Mumbai.

No more.

Such dragnets disappeared this month after the government overhauled its tax system, allowing Mr. Shaji and millions of truck drivers to motor past what used to delay their trips by hours. The delays and tax fees -- plus widespread bribes -- drove up costs and added to inefficiencies in the economy.

The result is an early success for a major economic initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: replacing a tangle of state and federal levies with a new goods and services tax -- a type of value-added tax. Some economists say the so-called GST, which kicked off July 1, may eventually add nearly 1 percentage point to GDP growth.

Still, the new system has teething pains.

Many of India's millions of small-business owners say they haven't had enough time to prepare. They don't know which of the multiple rates to pay or understand how to file their invoices. Many lack the stable internet connection needed to file.

The textile industry, India's second-largest employer after agriculture, has had disruptions as traders adjust. It and other industries have organized strikes and protests against the plan, saying they weren't ready.

The big test comes on Sept. 5 when businesses are required to file their first tax returns. It will then also become clear whether the government tax portal vital to the plan is ready to upload and process them.

But many experts are encouraged by the process so far, the culmination of a decade of wrangling between Indian states and the central government.

""Generally things have gone smoother than expected,"" said Sachin Menon, partner and national head of indirect tax for KPMG.

Almost seven million of the eight million VAT and service-tax taxpayers under the old system have registered for GST, and more than 560,000 businesses have signed up to pay tax for the first time, the government says. The government hopes that many more small businesses will register over time as the benefits of a tax credits system -- and the threat of penalties -- lures them in.

Meanwhile, the logistics industry is showing the first visible signs of the transformation the tax could deliver by easing some of India's biggest economic drags -- corruption and bureaucracy.

The industry contributes about 13% to the country's GDP but is still underdeveloped, highly fragmented and fraught with inefficiencies, according to financial-services provider Avendus Capital Pvt. Ltd. Before GST was implemented, it would take 11 days for a container to travel from Shanghai to Mumbai, but almost double that to get from Mumbai to Delhi, the World Bank said in a report. Up to a quarter of journey time was spent at checkpoints.

Trucking companies say while shipping orders are down as companies get used to GST, the elimination of border tax posts in most Indian states has expedited the movement of goods and cut fuel and labor costs.

""Implementation of GST is already showing significant efficiency gains in supply chain and transportation,"" a spokesman for Wal-Mart India said.

Experts say Indian economic growth may be lifted by reduced transportation times and increased compliance that will boost revenue for the government that could be spent on infrastructure, sanitation and education.

""Before the GST, some companies had multiple warehousing across different states only because they didn't want to move goods across state borders,"" said Rajiv Biswas, an economist at IHS Markit.

Mahesh Fogla, chief financial officer of Mumbai-based Patel Integrated Logistics, said he expected the tax revamp to save his company up to the equivalent of $620,000 annually and yield a 25% increase in profit. Antique Stock Broking Ltd., a Mumbai financial-services company, estimated in a report that drivers will save up to about $115 in bribes on each trip in checkpoint graft.

However groups of officials known as ""flying squads,"" who carry out spot checks to examine paperwork, still demand payments, said Navin Gupta, secretary-general of industry lobby the All India Motor Transport Congress. ""Physically the check post barriers have been removed, but the flying squads are still there,"" he said.

At the deserted checkpoint in Mankhurd just outside Mumbai, where Mr. Shaji and other drivers previously had to stop to enter the megacity, one official said 2,500 vehicles would pass through daily to be assessed for taxes.

The 43-year-old Mr. Shaji, who has been driving for 25 years, said that before the GST he would have to wait for hours as hundreds of items were checked and the tax calculated at three tax points along the route.

""Now we can pre-calculate our travel time,"" he said, relaxing with a cigarette after a long drive. ""I am free of tension and I can spend more time with my family and friends."" ",2017-07-19 22:23:07

**Our Jails As Good As Yours, Vijay Mallya Will Be Fine, India Tells UK** 

 ______ 
Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi has reassured the UK authorities about prison
conditions for Vijay Mallya.

**NEW DELHI: **

Months before a London Court begins hearing New Delhi's request to extradite
fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya, India has got down to countering attempts
by the liquor baron to avoid returning to the country to stand trial for
defaulting on loans of over Rs. 9,000 crore.

Indians and foreigners alike have used the poor condition of jails and
instances of a never-ending trial as some of the reasons to oppose their
extradition to India. They often succeed.

An Indian delegation led by Union Home Secretary Mr Rajiv Mehrishi reassured
UK authorities that much of these apprehensions were exaggerated.

At his meeting with his British counterpart Patsy Wilkinson in London last
week

, Mr Mehrishi said individuals extradited from the UK could not be given
preferential treatment but stressed that central prisons had facilities on par
with European jails, and getting better.

The home ministry had recently told the Maharashtra government to improve the
conditions of its Arthur Road jail where Mr Mallya would be sent if he is
extradited from the United Kingdom. This jail already has had quite a few
famous inmates

including former Maharashtra minister Chhagan Bhujbal who faces corruption
charges.

Once dubbed the ""King of Good Times"", the liquor baron, who is the co-owner of
Formula One team Force India, had been living in Britain since March last year
as the banks started collaborating on the recovery of the loans. He was
briefly arrested by the UK police in April following India's request for
extradition.

A joint team of the

Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate

is in London to submit fresh evidence in the case including the charge-sheet
filed by directorate officials last month in a Mumbai court.

The court is expected to start hearings in December this year

and deliver its verdict within a few weeks.

Mr Mehrishi's visit came against the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi's talks with Prime Minister Theresa May on the sidelines of the G20
meeting in Hamburg recently. PM Modi had asked for

Britain's cooperation in sending ""economic offenders"" back to India

**Chinese media fires salvo, blames Hindu nationalism for Doklam standoff** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 The Chinese newspaper has termed Hindu nationalism as the cause for standoff.

2 It also reads that PM Modi won on the Hindu nationalism wave.

3 It said that the same nationalism is pushing India in to war with China.

China's State media have this past month waged a relentless campaign blaming India for ""trespassing"" into the Doklam region, where China's road-building into territory claimed by Bhutan triggered a standoff on June 16.

Today, one Chinese English-language newspaper offered a rather bizarre explanation for the standoff: ""rising Hindu nationalism in India"".

""India should be careful and not let religious nationalism push the two countries into war,"" wrote columnist Yu Ning in the Party-run Global Times, a hawkish tabloid that doesn't necessarily reflect official views and is known in China to often taken provocative stances aimed largely at raising the hackles of foreign audiences.

Yu's commentary in the English-language edition, which is mainly read overseas, was headlined ""Hindu nationalism risks pushing India into war with China"".

It said that ""the election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fuelled the country's nationalist sentiments"", and argued that the Modi government ""can do nothing if religious nationalism becomes extreme, as shown in its failure to curb violent incidents against Muslims since he came to power in 2014.""

'MODI TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HINDU NATIONALISM'

""Modi took advantage of rising Hindu nationalism to come to power,"" it added. ""Nationalist fervour that demands revenge against China has taken root in India since the border war. This, on one hand, has enhanced his prestige and ability to control the country, but on the other, has made India more subject to the influence of conservatives, thus hampering reform. In diplomacy, New Delhi is demanded to act tougher in foreign relations, especially toward countries like Pakistan and China. The border row this time is an action targeted at China that caters to the demand of India's religious nationalists.""

The commentary said that ""regardless of China's call urging India to withdraw its troops that have crossed the border, New Delhi has continued its provocation"".

""Where the China-India competition goes hinges on each side's strength and wisdom,"" it said. ""India is weaker than China in terms of national strength, but its strategists and politicians have shown no wisdom in preventing India's China policy from being kidnapped by rising nationalism. This will put India's own interests in jeopardy.""

**Narendra Modi government social security insurance schemes may well unravel; here are reasons why** 

 ______ 
The government is on a wait-and-watch mode as it is hopeful that once the pool of policy holders reach a critical mass, claims ratio could climb down. (AP)

The high level of claims for the Narendra Modi government’s flagship social-security insurance schemes are threatening their viability. The claims-to-premium ratio for the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) — a term life insurance policy — hit an unsustainable 121% in 2016-17, the second year of operations.

The ratio was an even higher 170% in 2016-17 for the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), under which payment of Rs 2 lakh is guaranteed in the case of accidental deaths or grievous injuries.

These schemes, launched in May 2015, were projected as path-breaking steps to provide affordable, universal access to essential social security protection. The annual premium payable under PMJJBY, which covers even suicidal deaths, is Rs 330 while the same is just Rs 12 for PMSBY. The premium amount has to be paid by May-end every year for renewal and the policies are linked to the beneficiary bank accounts.

In the first two years of the schemes, the claim-to-premium ratios were 88% for PMJJBY policies, under which the sum assured is again, `2 lakh, and 121% for PMSBY. Compare this with the claims ratio of 40-45% for usual personal-accident and term life covers.

Very high claim ratios have caused a sense discomfort among insurers over the polcies, particularly PMSBY. Mostly public-sector insurance companies like New India Assurance, National Insurance Company and United India Insurance offer the extremely low-cost policies under PMSBY.

According to sources, the insurers have made several representations to the government, asking for a major increase in premium amount so that the losses from PMSBY don’t surge. “The companies have written to the government suggesting that PMSBY be repriced from Rs 12 to Rs 75-100 while agreeing to give a higher accident cover of Rs 4 lakh,” an actuary with a state-run insurance company told FE.

The government is, however, still on a wait-and-watch mode as it is hopeful that once the pool of policy holders reach a critical mass, claims ratio could climb down. Analysts also feel that the trends in the two schemes meant for the poor need to be watched for another couple of years before repricing them.

“It (claims ratio in PMJJBY) is not very alarming as of now. But, if this trend continues year after year, then something has to be done in terms of pricing,” said S B Mathur, former chairman of LIC and Life Insurance Council. He is of the view that even claims ratio of 105-106% should not be an issue given the social-security nature of the schemes. Insurance earn at least 6-7% annually from investing premiums collected. Mathur cited claims ratio well above 100% in the third-party motor insurance policies to drive home his point.

The losses to insurers from the social-security schemes are higher than the differential between claims and premiums as they also incur additional expenditure on agent and bank fees. Such expenses stood at Rs 127 crore for PMJJBY and Rs 20 crore for PMSBY in 2016-17.

Rise in claims ratio is one reason why the two policies are not aggressively marketed by insurers; the number of policies under both schemes grew by just 5% in 2016-17 – 3.11 crore and 10.02 crore people have obtained PMJJBY and PMSBY policies till May-end, 2017. About 29 crore bank accounts have been opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana in the last three years to provide various social security benefits to the poor seamlessly.

“If the claims ratio continues to be at such high level for another 1-2 years for both PMSBY and PMJJY schemes, then one could see price revision or change in entitlements. One option is to reduce sum assured for the older people and retain/increase the same for younger people,” said Kapil Mehta, co-founder of SecureNow Insurance Broker.

**Presidential election results LIVE updates: Counting of ballots to begin at 11 am; Will it be Kovind or Meira Kumar?** 

 ______ 
Presidential election results LIVE updates: Opposition’s presidential candidate Meira Kumar and NDA’s candidate Ram Nath Kovind. Presidential election results LIVE updates: Opposition’s presidential candidate Meira Kumar and NDA’s candidate Ram Nath Kovind.

India is all set to get its 14th President as the counting of ballots for the presidential election will begin at 11 am on Thursday. The name of the next occupant of the Rashtrapati Bhawan would be known by around 5.00 pm. First, the ballot box of Parliament House would be opened, and then, the ballot boxes received from states would be counted on alphabetical basis.

The votes would be counted on four separate tables and there would be eight rounds of counting. An Election Commission official, who has witnessed previous two presidential polls, said usually results are declared around 5 pm. Close to 99 per cent voting was recorded for electing India’s next president. The numbers seem to be stacked in favour of NDA’s nominee Ram Nath Kovind over Meira Kumar, the opposition’s candidate.

Presidential election results LIVE updates:

9:45 am: NCP leader Praful Patel said in New Delhi on Wednesday that Ram Nath Kovind will surely win and that there’s no rocket science. “All MPs don’t necessarily vote only according to conscience, they also vote according to party lines, and party lines are divided somewhat on ideology, principles and political positioning,” Patel had said.

9:24 am: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first to vote on Monday morning. He had reached the Parliament House 10 minutes before voting started.

9:02 am: Anoop Mishra, Lok Sabha secretary general, had said on Wednesday that in a large number of states, including Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Puducherry, voting was 100 per cent.

8:42 am: There have also been speculations over cross-voting in the Presidential elections. Parties such as NCP have publicly denied any such rumours linked to the them. Party spokesperson Nawab Malik had said on Wednesday that rumours alleging that NCP MPs and MLAs are voting for the NDA presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind are false, adding that they will be voting for Meira Kumar.

8:36 am: Support for Ram Nath Kovind also came from CPI(M)-ruled Tripura, six MLAs of Trinamool Congress and one Congress MLA as they defied their parties and voted in favour of NDA’s candidate. TMC had already sacked the six MLAs from their party.

8:25 am: It is likely that NDA nominee Ram Nath Kovind could register an emphatic victory in the Presidential elections today, with over 7 lakh votes in his favour. This is owing largely to a larger support base and cross-voting from some sections.

8:10 am: A total of 4,896 voters — 4,120 MLAs and 776 elected MPs — were eligible to cast their ballot for the Presidential elections. MLCs of states with legislative council are not part of the electoral college. While the value of an MLA’s vote depends on the population of the state he or she belongs to, the value of an MP’s vote remains the same at 708.

8:00 am: NDA’s nominee Ram Nath Kovind has number stacked in his favour over the opposition’s candidate Meira Kumar. Thirty two polling stations including the one in Parliament house, were set up in various states for the Presidential elections.

**Modi rolled out GST in a hurry to impress the world and Donald Trump: Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
Banswara (Rajasthan): Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday sought to corner the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government over the goods and services tax (GST) issue claiming the indirect tax regime was rolled out in a hurry to “impress” the world, ignoring the interests of small businessmen in the country.

Addressing a farmers’ rally at a college ground in the tribal region of Rajasthan in Banswara, he said Parliament can function at midnight to rollout the goods and services tax but no discussion on farmers’ issues can take place “even for a minute”.

More From Livemint »

“I was in the Lok Sabha before coming to Banswara. We wanted a discussion over farmers’ issues but we were not allowed to speak, not even for a minute,” he claimed. The GST on the other hand, was implemented at midnight, Gandhi said.

“The prime minister wanted to show it to the world and to the US President. But India does not belong to the US. Hindustan belongs to the farmers, labourers, small businessmen,” he said, while addressing thousands of people who came to Banswara from different parts of Rajasthan and nearby states, including Madhya Pradesh.

Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of ignoring the interest of farmers, Gandhi said his party stands with the tillers and would put pressure on the Vasundhara Raje-led government in Rajasthan to waive farm loans. He claimed that the Congress put pressure on the BJP government which led to the farm loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh.

“We had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a farm loan waiver, right prices for the crops and waiving electricity bills. We had even submitted a petition to the government signed by two crore farmers,” the Congress vice president said.

He said the demand for loan waivers was being raised across the country and the Congress governments in Karnataka and Punjab had already written off loans. “The Congress in Rajasthan will put pressure on the state government and will get the farmers’ loans waived... We will not let the chief minister sleep till then,” Gandhi said.

He asked the state party leaders to put pressure on the government to waive farm loans and said he was ready to go to any district or place whenever required for this. “We are not in the government. Had we been, there would not have been a need for this speech,” Gandhi said.

The Congress vice president said in the run up to the 2014 general elections, two major promises related to farmers and the youth were made by Modi. “Modi talks about ‘Make in India’ and jobs for youths. But when we raised a question in Parliament, the government replied that less than one lakh jobs were given last year,” he said.

Wondering how the country would progress if jobs were not created and tribals, Dalits and the poor were not given their rights, Gandhi alleged that the NDA government was only functioning for “the sake of 50 big industrialists” of the country.

He claimed that the voices of the weak, did not reach the BJP and the RSS. “The government is being run for a few big businessmen who earn a lot. But, for small traders, Dalits and farmers, they do not have any concern,” Gandhi said.

Before addressing the rally, Gandhi met the families of a few farmers who had committed suicide and small traders on the college grounds. Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot alleged farmers were being exploited under the BJP’s rule, both at the Centre and in the state.

“Incidents of farmer suicide are on the rise in Rajasthan. This rally will give a message that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, the farmers of India will throw the BJP out of power,” he said.

Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleged that the BJP came to power on false promises and was working in a “vindictive” manner. He said major projects such a power plant, Jaipur Metro, Parwan dam and the Banswara-Ralam railway line project had been stalled. Congress leaders C P Joshi, Mohan Prakash, Girija Vyas, Mahendrajeet Singh Malvia and others also addressed the rally.

430,"&gt; Did you not even read the articles you posted in reply? The one in scientific american clearly has professors counteracting the claims that this is normal. The Washington Examiner only has two officials from the EPA saying ""this is totally normal."" Why wouldn't they say that? Are you expecting them to acknowledge what they did is a totally unprecedented?

I'm sorry but,

a) The opinionated pieces in Scientific American are precisely that, opinions.

b) The ""gag order"" was severely sensationalized. It was simply a temporary protocol that restructured the EPAs public affairs policy. Of course, the new public affairs policy is not the best, but it is hardly a gag order. Here's the actual explanation:

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/firestorm-over-supposed-gag-order-agricultural-scientists-was-self-inflicted-wound

Can you find me a credible source which says that the White House wanted to ban information? There was a single post, in what I think was the Washington Examiner, that trash magazines like The Verge and The Quartz picked up and this was sensationalized news that was pretty much ignored in real academic circles.

c) My contention is, that there was never a real ""gag order"". I am a liberal, and not a supporter of trump in any way, but there are institutions within science that prevent things such as gag orders. It is very different when the EPA is told to review its talks to the public, versus when the EPA is told not to research something. The former is normal, most agencies, public or private, in the United States are supposed to hold reviews before talking to the public to get their biased views across. However, we should be concerned when the agencies are not allowed to conduct specific research, which has and hopefully will never happen.

d) The ""gag order"" was lifted:

If you go to the EPA website or any other EPA media outlet, they happily share information. Information on the agency level is biased towards the Trump administration, information on an individual scientist level is fairly objective. Go figure.

e) Now I agree with you, the Trump administration is bad for the environment and will push its agenda through the new media through the EPA. But they will not undo decades of work that have been instituted to protect the environment, will definitely subject America to a downward trend in the short-term, but I think they will subject the US to a downward trend in most things :)

&gt; Just because someone was a reasonable human being one day, doesn't mean they can't become unreasonable over decades of being fed essentially propaganda on conservative TV networks and radio stations.

Anecdotal and not based in fact. There has been propaganda on American TV and on any TV for decades. To say that the American people are going to become radicalized because of Trump is as qualified as saying the Indian people are going to become radicalized because of Modi.

If that is what the intent of your statement was, then sure.

&gt; Uh, just because you never heard of it doesn't mean its not true. http://www.nature.com/news/climate-scientists-flock-to-france-s-call-1.22318 Hundreds of scientists have applied to go to France!

Now, it is my turn to ask you, did you read the article you posted. 

You have sensationally said that ""Hundreds of scientists have applied to go to France!""

&gt; Hundreds of climate scientists, including many from the United States

Hardly hundreds of american scientists.

&gt; Most applied for relatively short sabbaticals

Barely an exodus.

&gt; but the 154 scientists attracted by longer-term stays of four years or more are of most interest to the initiative's organizers

Ok

&gt;  The scheme will shortlist as many as 80 scientists by mid-September, with 50 or so winners to be announced around the end of November.

50 scientists will be allowed to immigrate into France.

Do you know how many climate scientists america has? The American Meteorological society has around 14,000 members and the Geophysical society has around 62,000 members. Let's assume that even 30% of these totally are american citizens, your statement that American Scientists are leaving to go to France would be the equivalent of saying that 0.002% of American scientists leaving is a cause for alarm.

The attrition rates of most scientific organizations and communities are well over 1%. This is hardly an indicator of a systematic issue in American scientific infrastructure.

&gt; Ok. Up till now I thought you were being reasonable, but do you have any idea what is going on in the United States??? We have decreasing crime rates yet 1% of the population is in prison working as essentially slave labor. The nation has been gerrymandered by Republicans, we now have a majority of conservative justices on the SC with one liberal judge about to retire. Net neutrality is about to die. Regulations that protect consumers are being dissolved day by day. The DOJ wants to amp up the war on drugs. Private mercenaries are deployed against citizens in Standing Rock. The conservative agenda consists of full on class warfare. If you don't think people aren't being quashed and freedoms aren't being taken away you're not paying attention. Yeah I might sound alarmist, but inequality is increasing and people are really struggling, you might not be aware in your ivory tower.

Of course, I agree with all of this. I understand the american industrial prison complex and institutional failures in regards to policies of healthcare, education, drugs and environment. But we are talking about pure science funding. There is no reason to get personal and talk about ivory towers. You have no idea about the life I live and I make no assumptions about the life you live. Let's keep the conversation civil and non-personal.

Sure, I do agree America is on a downward trend due to the spread of misinformation and general unintelligence, but my argument focuses on the American scientific community, which continues to provide an environment of stellar research and continuos funding and support. Of course there are funding cuts, but never do people talk about funding increases and the media sensationalizes such things. 

Let's talk about the topic on hand, Science. If you look at the chart below, you will see an increase in science funding that is consistent, if not more than that of inflation.

https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJtaXylJfVAhVHE7wKHdj1A1sQjRwIBw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aaas.org%2Fpage%2Fhistorical-trends-federal-rd&amp;psig=AFQjCNHiH4iutIMR6bpAwL4NzsyNIxoahA&amp;ust=1500616132327058

I agree that the Trump administration is proposing to make cuts that will be unfortunate, but the transitory does not represent the trend, and the trend has been good so far.

**In a National First, This Delhi Train Gets A Big Makeover** 

 ______ 
Indian Railways plan to induct at least four other solar-powered trains in the
next six months (AFP)

**New Delhi: **

Indian railways has added solar panels to the roof of a train in a national
first as India tries to reduce its massive carbon footprint and modernise its
vast colonial-era rail network.

The lighting, fans and information displays inside the train -- once powered
by diesel -- will run off the sun's energy after the panels were fitted to the
carriage.

The train has begun journeys around New Delhi, helping move just some of the
23 million passengers who use India's rail network every day.

""We will be inducting at least four other solar-powered trains in the next six
months,"" Anil Kumar Saxena, Indian railways spokesperson, told AFP on
Wednesday.

Batteries charged by the solar panels during the day take over if there is no
sunlight, Saxena added. Only as a last resort, if the batteries perish, would
diesel be used.

Batteries charged by the solar panels during the day take over if there is no
sunlight

Each train drawing on this green energy is expected to save around 21,000
litres of diesel every year, helping reduce India's enormous reliance on
fossil fuels and huge output of carbon emissions.

Built by India's former British colonial rulers, the railway system is one of
the world's largest and is still the main means of long-distance travel in the
huge country.

But years of financial neglect and a populist policy of subsidising fares have
hit the network hard. Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to revive it after
coming to power in May 2014.

439,"&gt; What is ur point?

When the scheme was introduced, I pointed it out here that this scheme is a subsidy/welfare. Those were early days of the Modi rule. Back in those days, Modi fanbais still believed that Modi is to the right of Congress. So fanbais were dead against welfares/subsidies in those days (as against now when they say that it's absolutely necessary). So they argued with me that it was not a subsidy and it would pay for itself like regular insurance policies. My point was that if these policies were not loss making then insurance companies would have introduced it themselves without the need for the Govt to introduce them.",2017-07-20 15:13:49
440,"&gt;  in a democracy like India there would be no government that will not engage themselves in freebies and subsidies for public appeasement.

Yes, that's the position fanbais are adopting now. Back in those days when they didn't yet know that Modi is Nehru 2.0, subsidies used to be like a bad word for the fanbais out here. Likewise about the Jan Dhan Subsidy. Fanbais used to argue vigorously that Atal Jan Dhan Yojana was not a subsidy but a windfall for banks.

&gt; NDA II basically agreed to pretty much all the recommendations of the parliamentary committee recommendations, and then worked on neutralizing the Congress by getting Nitish, Mamata and Patnaik on board. The Congress had no choice but to get on board.

**Kanwar yatra: ‘Golden Baba’ is back, with 2kg more gold, a rolex watch, a BMW, 2 Audis, 3 Fortuners** 

 ______ 
Golden Baba, who is famous for participating in Kanwar Yatra wearing gold ornaments, has added a gold chain weighing two kilograms to his collection. Baba aka Sudhir Makkar is well known throughout the 200km yatra route from Hardwar to Delhi.

The addition of the chain has taken Baba’s gold ornaments to about 14.5kgs which include a collection of 21 gold chains, 21 lockets of deities, armlets and even a gold jacket which he wears sometimes during the yatra sitting atop his SUV which is one among the cavalcade of 16 vehicles that accompany him.

“The new chain weighs two kgs and has a locket of Shiva. I am not wearing much gold on this journey as its weight has affected my nerves at the neck and also affected vision of one eye. This is my penultimate Kanwar Yatra and 2018 will be last ending with a silver jubilee,” Baba said.

Apart from his fetish for gold, Baba also wears a Rolex watch worth Rs 27 lakh and owns a BMW, three Fortuners, two Audi and two Innova vehicles which are part of his cavalcade. On several occasions, he has taken cars such as Hummer, Jaguar and Land Rover on rent for his trip to Haridwar.

“The love for gold and cars will not die. I remember it was in 1972-73 when gold price was Rs 200 per tola (10 grams). I started wearing gold items and had nearly four tolas that time. Gradually, the gold increased. I will keep the gold with me till I die. It will be handed over to my favourite disciple when I leave the world,” said the 55-year-old.

Before moving to spiritualism, Makkar ran a successful cloth and property business from the Gandhi Nagar market in Delhi. He now has a luxurious flat at a high-rise in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad.

The initial years of life were, however, difficult for him. He went to a gurukul at the age of six and went to Haridwar in search of livelihood. He sold rosary beads and cloth on pavements.

“Later, my business flourished with the grace of lord Shiva. I sold jeans, shirts and jackets with the brand name Bittu. Even the property business flourished as I got completely devoted to Shiva,” he said.

These days Baba travels along with a team of 18 bouncers and eight security officers who keep an eye on his gold while he is on the move. Popular also as Shri Mahant Ji Golden Puri Babaji, Makkar said that he still has a lot of property in Delhi. His disciples estimate that Baba, who has no children, owns property worth over Rs 150 crore.

Baba is a popular figure in the annual pilgrimage. Children, women and youngster wait eagerly for his cavalcade to arrive on erstwhile NH-58. They make his videos, click selfies with him and even touch his feet for blessings.

“It is out of affection that everyone loves me, more so as I wear gold. Throughout the route, people from all communities, including Muslims, shower love on me and cheer me up,” he said.

His participation, however, keeps the local police officers on toes.

“He often stops midway and we have to rush to make arrangements for his security. It is tough as he has a large number of cars and other vehicles in his cavalcade. Our arrangements are in place and we hope that his last yatra will also be successful and without hindrance,” said Atul Kumar, sub divisional magistrate, Modi Nagar.

**Shadow economy struggles under weight of India's new tax regime** 

 ______ 
On the edge of one of India's biggest slums, Alauddin Ansari opens a paper ledger of daily sales at his small leather shop and points to a blank page. That's the tally for today. Nothing.Before Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the country's new goods and services tax on July 1, Ansari said he was earning Rs 6,000 ($93) a day selling leather jackets, wallets, bags and belts. But India's new tax classified leather products as luxury items and raised the rate to 28 per cent -- more than double the 13.5 per cent tax levied until June 30. Since then, his business has collapsed.""My business is down nearly 75 per cent,"" Ansari said, turning a page to show he made just Rs 850 the previous day at his shop near Mumbai's vast Dharavi slum. ""Obviously, the GST has had an impact on trade. At 28 per cent, GST is a bit too much.""The leather sector is just one example of how India's vast informal economy -- which accounts for more than 90 percent of the workforce -- is struggling under India's new tax rates, which range widely from exemptions for items like basic food grains to 28 percent for products like air conditioners.In 2016, India's leather exports totaled $5.67 billion, according to the Council for Leather Exports. With an annual turnover of around $12 billion and as many as 3 million workers, the industry must also deal with Hindu nationalist attempts to ban bovine slaughter, which they rely on for raw hides, and rising incidents of violence from ""cow protector"" vigilantes.Even supporters of the tax expected months of economic chaos as millions of shopkeepers and manufacturers were dragged into the tax net for the first time. But many labor-intensive sectors -- from leather to textiles -- fear newly-high rates will have a lasting impact on industries that provide billions in export earnings, raising the chance that India's trade balance could widen in the next few months.Although it should increase tax compliance and government revenues over time, analysts are still waiting to gauge the short term disruption now rippling through India's $2.3 trillion economy. The GST comes less than a year after the government's shock cash ban sucked 86 per cent of the nation's currency out of circulation overnight, knocked India's GDP growth down to 6.1 per cent from 7.1 per cent and eliminated as many as 1.5 million jobs.The struggles of small leather retailers are indicative of the broader pain being felt by many small-and-medium-sized businesses in India's informal sector, said K.E. Raghunathan, president of the All India Manufacturers Organisation. Other unorganized sector workers making firecrackers, matches, textiles are also suffering, he said. And recent textile worker protests -- in which some burnt effigies of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley -- made little difference to the government's plans.""Their voice is never heard,"" Raghunathan said, adding that small businesses are ""unable to survive"" because there are ""no orders, no payment collection"" because of the GST.As many businesses were emerging from demonetization, when cash-strapped consumers avoided all-cash businesses and put off purchases, the GST added additional complexity. The impact of finally paying tax will create ""significant challenges"" for the unorganized sector, particularly for those who deal in lower-priced items, Jefferies analyst Piyush Nahar wrote in a note on July 13.""As it boosts compliance, GST will have a negative impact on unorganized sector firms which rely largely on tax arbitrage,"" Nahar wrote. ""While we believe that firms who benefit from tax non-compliance should face consequences, we are concerned on the impact on employment.""At another leather store in Dharavi, Anwar Sheikh explains that the GST-related downturn may force him to lay off one of his two employees.""Earlier, I used to do sales worth Rs 4,000 or 5,000,"" Sheikh said. ""This afternoon, I have made sales worth Rs 250. For how long will this last?""For the mainly-Muslim workers who toil in the leather industry, which cow-revering Hindus tend to shun for religious reasons, there is additional uncertainty.Modi, who condemned the spate of cow-related violence, has presided over an administration that has tried to introduce rules banning the sale of cattle and buffalo for slaughter in markets across the country. In May, the Supreme Court stayed that decision for three months.There have also been numerous attacks -- as well as beatings and attempts at extortion -- on farmers and livestock transporters as they brought animals to and from local markets. In Rajasthan , one farmer was beaten to death. Industry representatives have complained that local authorities are failing to stop the violence. That means poor farmers are too afraid to sell spent dairy buffaloes to the slaughterhouses which power India's leather and meat export industries.""Adding to our misery are all these killings related to beef and in the name of protecting cows,"" Sheikh said. It ""just makes it harder for us as Muslims to do business. We feel very insecure.""

Yeah sure put cow meat on bullets and ask them to bite it and the whole country will stand up in revolt, but exploit the poor piece by piece for thousands of years and people will just take it.

**Presidential election results 2017 live: Ram Nath Kovind becomes President with over 65% of votes** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: After eight rounds of counting today, Ram Nath Kovind has been elected as the 14th President of India. National Democratic Alliance’s candidate Kovind secured over 65% of votes over rival Meira Kumar, who was backed by the Congress and other opposition parties.

Given NDA’s clear advantage in terms of votes, Kumar had described her candidature against Kovind more as the “battle of ideology”. Both candidates come from the marginalised dalit community.

Before contesting Presidential elections, the 71-year-old Kovind was serving as the governor of Bihar. He will be only the second dalit leader after K.R. Narayanan since independence to occupy India’s highest Constitutional post.

Here are the latest updates and developments as the counting of votes for the election of 14th President of India begins:

■ Ram Nath Kovind: “I thank all those who supported me from across the country. I feel very emotional today and I will represent all those struggling to make a living. I never aspired to be the president. My win is a message to those discharging their duties with integrity. My election as the president is evidence of the greatness of Indian democracy.” (PTI)

■ BJP chief Amit Shah today hailed as “historic” the election of NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind as the next president and said it is a “victory for the poor, downtrodden and marginalised and their aspirations”.

**New President of India Ram Nath Kovind has very big shoes to fill | Opinion** 

 ______ 
As pointed out by the Prime Minister himself, the campaign for the 14th presidency was free of mudslinging and rancour, unlike the 2007 election of Pratibha Devi Singh Patil. Even the BJP’s arch political rivals who set up Meira Kumar against Ram Nath Kovind posited the contest as a battle of ideologies.

Regardless of the desirablity of consensus in elections to high constitutional offices, contest is integral to and at times inevitable in a democracy. In Kovind’s case, there was a near-consensus on his name with a host of non-NDA parties lining up behind his candidature.

Presenting the pro-Kovind mobilisation as a divide in the Congress-led Opposition ranks is but one way of looking at it. In reality, it places greater responsibility on the new incumbent in our increasingly competitive polity. Expectations of him became more acute in the light of his rival’s decorous electioneering for the high office.

I remember Kovind’s predecessor Pranab Mukherjee letting it be known at the outset of his tenure, that he’d run a constitutional presidency. His term overlapped the governments of Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi. But he broadly kept the promise of adhering to the book — barring the imposition of President’s rule in Uttarakhand which the Court overturned to his chagrin and that of the Modi regime on whose advice he signed the proclamation.

Like Mukherjee who won during the UPA rule, Kovind’s tenure will outlast that of the NDA that made him its candidate. His principal challenge won’t be dissimilar to the one faced by past presidencies: safeguarding the constitution without locking horns with the elected regime, or lying prostrate before it in the manner Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed did in the 1970s sullied by the imposition of Emergency rule.

APJ Abdul Kalam assumed office when AB Vajpayee was Prime Minister. But he was a compromise choice, an outlier who earned a name devising defence systems. In that sense, Kovind’s place in history is already secured as the Republic’s first President from the BJP-RSS’s ideological stock.

But as the country’s first citizen, his allegiance now is to the Constitution — in letter, spirit and sensitivity. The manner in which he accomplishes the task will embellish or demolish his legacy. His has to be a single book work religion.

The first Dalit to occupy the high office was K R Narayanan, the tenth president whom none opposed except the Shiv Sena. Kovind is second. But regional, caste or linguistic identities that might dictate nominations have to be subsumed bu the demands of office.

Narayanan for instance never let his caste background dictate his conduct in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. In fact, he resented being branded the country’s first Dalit president, asking close aides whether Zakir Hussain or Zail Singh were remembered as first Muslim and Sikh presidents? His emphasis was on what Bhimrao Ambedkar called ‘constitutional morality’ as the guiding light of the presidency bound by the aid and advice of the cabinet.

Such nuances shouldn’t be lost on Kovind — a former Governor —who studied law and practised it in the Supreme Court. But he will need to learn a lot while on the job, unlike Mukherjee, his immediate predecessor, whose familiarity with the system was surpassed only by YB Chavan, Swaran Singh and Jagjivan Ram, none of whom became President.

Compared to Kovind’s two terms in the Rajya Sabha, Mukherjee was Member of Parliament for 43 years, minister for 22 years and member of the Congress working committee for 28 years. That gives an idea of the size of the shoes the new President steps into.

Even Narayanan and Kalam held administrative offices before getting elevated. When they made a point, they were heard and sought to be convinced or persuaded by the executive with sane reasoning. Example: Mukherjee’s discomfiture over repeated promulgation of the enemy-property ordinance that took time getting Parliament’s nod.

The equation between the presidency and the elected dispensation has to be based on mutual respect, a healthy regard that facilitates an exchange of views. The PM’s equation with the new President might personally not be as deferential as it was with the vastly experienced Mukherjee, whom he recently called a father figure. But he’d have to accede to reason to help Kovind attain venerability as the keeper of the Constitution.

**Kerala BJP leader took Rs 5.60 crore to get MCI nod for college: Reports** 

 ______ 
A BJP probe panel has found that a Kerala party leader accepted Rs 5.60 crore from a businessman on the promise of getting the Medical Council of India’s (MCI) nod for a college, local media reports have said.

The BJP has denied that such a report, which was allegedly leaked to the media by a party faction, exists. The opposition has demanded a CBI probe, questioning the Modi government’s claim of corruption-free government.

“The BJP’s tall claims stand exposed now. We want a CBI inquiry into the kickbacks,” Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said.

The internal report should have first come up before the party leadership, BJP’s Kerala general secretary Sobha Surendran on Thursday said.

“Most of our leaders are not aware of such a report. We have learned about this from media only,” she said. The core committee group of the party would inquire how such a report originated and was leaked to press, she said.

BJP cooperative cell convener RS Vinod admitted accepting the money for granting medical college status to the SR Hospital in Varkala, media reports quoted the probe panel as saying.

Vinod allegedly gave the money to a middleman in Delhi through hawala dealers.

State BJP chief Kummanam Rajasekharan had set up a two-member probe panel after R Shaji, chairman of SR Educational and Charitable Trust, alleged he paid Rs 5.60 crore to party functionaries to get the MCI nod for a medical college in Varkala in south Kerala, the reports said.

The MCI is the regulator for medical and dental education in India.

“It is a serious charge. There is a mafia working behind the MCI and to get over the scourge Centre has appointed the Lodha commission. Still such bad precedents are happening and the party has to look into seriously,” Malayalam daily Mathrubhumi, the state’s second largest newspaper, said.

Shaji went public in May after he didn’t get the MCI permission. He also sent a copy of his complaint to BJP president Amit Shah, who asked Rajasekharan to order a probe, party sources said.

The probe panel also found that some party leaders accepted money for another medical college hospital in Palakkad district. Party general secretary MT Ramesh’s name allegedly cropped up but he has denied the allegations.

The Opposition Congress has sought a CBI inquiry into the alleged kickbacks and the ruling Communist Party of India MPs have decided to raise the issue in Parliament.

**Arun Jaitley asserts: No amount of sympathy to be shown for those indulging in cow lynchings**

The government today reiterated that it will show no sympathy to those indulging in lynchings in the name of cow and asked all state governments to take stern action against self-styled cow vigilantes.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, speaking on behalf of ailing Home Minister Rajnath Singh, told the Rajya Sabha, “The government’s stand is clear. Nobody is allowed to do that (lynching in the name of cow protection). There is no rationalisation, no arguments of sentiments being hurt can be an explanation for this. And, the government is absolutely committed.”

Jaitley was participating in the debate on ‘situation arising out of the reported increase in the incidents of lynching and atrocities on minorities and Dalits across the country.’ During the debate, several Opposition leaders had slammed the government and particularly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over such incidents.

“Violence can never be a partisan issue and can’t be justified,” said Jaitley, who is also the leader of the House. He stressed that the Prime Minister has spoken thrice on the issue.

“…legal action was taken systematically in each incident. People were arrested and they are in jail. They are all going to be chargesheeted against whom evidence is going to be found… This is clear and there is no ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’,” the finance minister said countering the Opposition’s charge that the accused were not being prosecuted.

Jaitley said cow slaughter bans have been in place in various states from the time of the country’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and are enshrined in article 48 of the Constitution framed by the Constituent Assembly. Later, it was made part of 7th Schedule of the Constitution as a result of which the matter fell under the purview of the state governments.

“At that time, neither the BJP was in place, nor was any state ruled by the BJP,” he said.

“We have laws in place and if any such incident occurs where police is not acting and brought to our notice to this effect, the government will not think twice of requesting state governments and advising the state governments and even asking for reports as well as states are concerned,” he added.

**Sushma Swaraj snubs China, says all nations with India on Dokalam** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: India on Thursday shrugged off Chinese pressure to withdraw from the Dokalam plateau, situated at the tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China, saying that the law was on New Delhi’s side in the matter.

This came on a day that the Chinese foreign ministry said diplomatic channels between the two countries were open but repeated its demand that India withdraw its troops from the Dokalam plateau as a “precondition” for any meaningful dialogue between the Asian giants to resolve the month-old face-off.

More From Livemint »

It also came as India announced that its national security advisor Ajit Doval would be travelling to China next week for a meeting of the national security advisors from BRICS, or the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa emerging economies bloc.

In Parliament on Thursday, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said China was aiming to unilaterally change the status of the tri-junction with Bhutan, which poses a challenge to India’s security.

There was a written agreement between India, China and Bhutan in 2012 that the three nations will together decide on the boundaries at the tri-junction, she said.

India and China have a dispute over their boundaries dating back to the 1962 war and are in talks to resolve their differences. Tensions between the neighbours have been high for the past month with Chinese troops trying to construct a road on the Dokalam plateau that the Bhutanese objected to. Indian troops stationed in Bhutan under a special security arrangement have intervened to keep Chinese troops at bay, triggering the face-off.

Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognizes it as Dokalam, while China claims it as part of its Donglang region. Of the 3,488-km India-China border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim.

In her statement, Swaraj said India was not being “unreasonable” on the issue and all nations were with it. “India’s position is not wrong on the tri-junction and all nations are with it. The law is with our country,” she said, adding: “We are willing to talk, but both sides have to first take back their armies.”

During a foreign ministry briefing in New Delhi, spokesman Gopal Baglay made a renewed pitch for a “peaceful resolution” through diplomatic channels, stressing that “differences” should not become “disputes”.

“India’s approach is to have a peaceful resolution of issues on its border with China,” he said. An understanding reached at a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in June was that differences between the nations should not be allowed to become disputes. Modi met Xi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in June, in the Kazakh capital Astana.

Meanwhile, in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters that diplomatic channels with India remained “unimpeded” to discuss the military stand-off but repeated the position that withdrawal of Indian troops from the Dokalam area is a “precondition” for any meaningful dialogue, PTI reported.

Lu also repeated the Chinese accusation that “Indian border personnel illegally trespassed into China’s territory,” the report said.

Chinese officials say while there may not be a formal meeting between Indian national security advisor Doval—who is also India’s special representative for talks on the boundary dispute—and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi, there could be informal talks between the two officials. Both countries have so far held 19 rounds of talks.

Separately, in an opinion piece, the state-run Global Times website said Modi’s election in 2014 had fuelled nationalist sentiments.

“This, on one hand, has enhanced his prestige and ability to control the country, but on the other, has made India more subject to the influence of conservatives, thus hampering reform. In diplomacy, New Delhi is demanded to act tougher in foreign relations, especially toward countries like Pakistan and China,” it said.

“The border row this time is an action targeted at China that caters to the demand of India’s religious nationalists,” the opinion piece said.

“Where the China-India competition goes hinges on each side’s strength and wisdom. India is weaker than China in terms of national strength, but its strategists and politicians have shown no wisdom in preventing India’s China policy from being kidnapped by rising nationalism. This will put India’s own interests in jeopardy,” it warned.

**A Gift Of Words And Silence** 

 ______ 
Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar (PTI Photo) Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar (PTI Photo)

What are the qualities a successful politician must have? No doubt he needs to win elections and, of course, he has to be an effective administrator. Yet there’s a further quality that underlies these two that’s often ignored. It’s the ability — or the talent? — to say the right thing, in a judicious manner, at the appropriate time. If you think about it, it’s this felicity with speech that makes a politician electable. Often, while handling tricky situations, this fortunate quality smoothens awkward moments and creates harmony where there is discord. The gift of the gab — although this is more than that because I’m not just talking about eloquence, rhetoric or oratory but the knack of the mot juste, commendable discretion and a gentle sympathetic touch — is essential. Good politicians have it and use it all the time. Bad ones don’t and it’s very apparent when they speak.

Recent comments by Former Defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, clearly suggest which category this good gentleman falls into. Speaking to industrialists he chose to comment, without any need to do so and possibly without even being asked, on why India had launched surgical strikes across the Myanmarese border in 2015 and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir a year later. What he had to say should not only never have been said but, now that it has been expressed, raises undeniable concerns. Of the first strike, he explained that it happened because he “felt insulted”. As he put it: “A small terrorist organisation of 200 people killing 18 Dogra soldiers was an insult to the Indian Army and we sat in the afternoon and sat in the evening and worked out the (plan of) the first surgical strike.”

Of the second, on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, he suggested it was prompted by a TV debate following the Myanmarese strike. “One question hurt me. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, an ex-army man, was explaining about all kinds of search operations. An anchor asked him ‘would you have the courage and capability of doing the same on the western front?’ I listened very intensely but decided to answer when the time came.” These answers suggest that the decisions were either made impetuously or reactively and in response to hurt or offence. They certainly don’t lead you to believe they were taken carefully, calculatedly and with deep consideration. In addition, it would appear the first strike happened at very short notice which possibly raises questions about its preparedness. Worse, it would seem the second was to appease the minister’s amour-propre rather than standing up for the nation’s interests. The two could be the same but not necessarily so.

Now, there was no need for Parrikar to reveal any of this. These were thoughts best kept under wraps or retained for his post-retirement memoirs. To make them public when his government is still in office and he is himself an important chief minister was immature and foolhardy. This is, of course, the latest of Parrikar’s gaffes. There have been several earlier. At the time, we laughed them off or, after vigorous criticism, forgot them. But taken together they prove my point. Knowing what to say, when, to whom, to what extent, with what language and tone and, finally, what to keep back and when to stop is a critical quality in a successful politician. I feel confident Narendra Modi will not disagree. Despite a few glaring and occasionally embarrassing exceptions, he is clearly a master of this art.

**No sympathy for lynching in the name of cow, law will take its course: Govt** 

 ______ 
Facing attacks over lynching incidents, the government on Thursday asserted that killings in the name of cow “sentiments” was unacceptable and said the state governments should take stern action against those indulging in such violence.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who was replying to a debate on lynchings in the Rajya Sabha on behalf of ailing home minister Rajnath Singh, made it clear that the central government could not be blamed for violence by “some people” as it was the responsibility of the state governments to deal with such issues.

“The government’s stand is clear. Nobody is allowed to do that (lynching in the name of cow protection). There is no rationalisation, no arguments of sentiments being hurt can be an explanation for this. And, the government is absolutely committed,” he said.

He said “no amount of sympathy” will be shown for those who indulge in lynching and “law will certainly take its own course.”

Jaitley, who is also the Leader of the House, was replying to the debate on ‘situation arising out of the reported increase in the incidents of lynching and atrocities on minorities and dalits across the country’, during which the opposition parties slammed the government and particularly targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over such incidents.

Most of the opposition parties blamed RSS-affiliates for the cow vigilantism, with the Congress accusing the prime minister of doing nothing to restrain them and “creating such an environment” by indulging in “double speak”.

Rejecting the Opposition’s allegations, Jaitley said the prime minister had spoken thrice against cow vigilantism.

“The government unequivocally condemns the killing of human beings in the name of protecting cows,” he declared, adding, “nobody has the right to take law in his own hands”.

At the same time, cow slaughter should not be “praised” or “eulogised”, he said, referring to an incident in Kerala where a cow was slaughtered on a road by some youth Congress workers and ‘beef festivals’ were held.

“The incidents of people saying that they will display in Kerala as to how cow is cut and hold festival is equally damaging to the country as lynching in a train,” he said.

“Violence can never be a partisan issue and can’t be justified... One of your (Congress) CMs of the prohibited states has the audacity to say that given a choice he will eat beef,” Jaitley added.

On the Opposition charge of inaction, Jaitley asserted that “legal action was taken systematically in each incident. People were arrested and they are in jail. They are all going to be chargesheeted against whom evidence is going to be found...This is clear and there is no ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’.”

In his speech, he emphasised that cow slaughter was banned in most of the states during the time of first Prime Minister Jawaharalal Nehru, who was “secular and not over- religious” unlike Indira Gandhi who was “more religious”.

“This (ban on cow slaughter) was not proposed by Modi ji or Rajnath ji. This was said by Ambedkar during Nehru’s time,” Jaitley said, adding ban on cow slaughter was presribed in the Article 48 of the Constitution framed by the Constituent Assembly.

Later, it was made part of 7th Schedule of the Constitution as a result of which the matter fell under the purview of the state governments.

“At that time, neither the BJP was in place, nor was any state ruled by the BJP,” he said, adding most of the states then were ruled by the Congress, which framed laws prohibiting cow slaughter.

“We have laws in place and if any such incident occurs where police is not acting and brought to our notice to this effect, the government will not think twice of requesting state governments and advising the state governments and even asking for reports as well as states are concerned,” he said.

“There are no ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’. Laws made in the states have provisions to preserve and protect cows. That right is with the state and its police. Nobody has the right to take law into their hands... If anybody does it, they should be arrested and prosecuted,” he said.

He said “selective morality” caused problem and cited how there were a series of reports on attack on chruches during elections in Delhi and not even one case was found politically motivated.

Jaitley said there was no difference in opinion between the government and the opposition as killing of human beings in the name of cow protection has to be unequivocally condemned.

Contending that the definition of secularism has been “distorted” in 70 years, he said the issue pertains to faith and needs introspection. He urged the opposition to rise above politics.

He took a jibe at the BSP saying if the law banning cow slaughter had been framed now, the party would have been the first to object that Baba Saheb Ambedkar was communal.

BSP leader Satish Misra said his party welcomes banning of cow slaughter but the question was killing of people in the name of cow.

Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said Kashmir, despite having Muslim majority, has a law prohibiting cow slaughter which has not been changed. He, however, decried killing of some people in the state on suspicion of ferrying beef.

He said the Opposition’s objection was to lynching and it wanted to know whether people of other religions had no right to do businesses like dairy as they were being targeted in the name of merely keeping the cows.

Jaitley said people have to be tolerant to each other as the country belongs to all. “We have vibrant secularism.”

At the same time, he said there were more instances of intolerance and violence in liberal societies.

During his speech, Jaitley attacked the Left Front, asking, “Why is it that incidents of violence increase in Kerala when the Left comes to power there? .. Why were there no incidents (of violence) when Oomen Chandi (of Congress) was there (till 2014).”

Addressing the opposition benches, he said, “If it want to know why it did not happen before 2014, you have chosen an eminent and fair man for Vice President...when you will go through every report that Gopal Krishna Gandhi has sent, you will be enlightened.”

At this, Azadi quipeed, “please do not divide the opposition.”

Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma then remarked in a lighter vein that since Jaitley has “acknowledged” that the opposition candidtate for Vice President was “emeinent and fair”, the ruling party should withdraw its candidate.

Jaitly also stressed the need for uplifting Dalits and weaker sections, saying the way they were treated in history needs to be reversed.

He said the issue boils down to effective action by the police in violence against the Dalits.

In case of police not acting in a state in crimes against Dalits, the Centre “will not hesitate” in telling that particular state to act.

The Centre can also seek report from the state, he said, adding if needed, the Union Home Ministry may monitor probe in any case.

A demand by some opposition members for a separate law for lynching was also set aside by Jaitley, saying the present law was sufficient to ensure justice.

Maintaining that the BJP was wrongly blamed for violence against minorities, he mentioned the attacks on churches in Delhi in the run-up to Delhi Assembly polls two years back. He said investigations had subsequently revealed that some drunkard or some urchin had damaged a church.

“But an impression was given that India had become intolerant”, he said, adding New York Times had then written an article about it, damaging India’s image.

No. When Pakistan kills out soldiers, these channels choose to target peaceniks, when there's a problem in Kashmir they target ""liberals"" etc. Their methods are so obvious but we have a population blind in Modi bhakti to see this.

**View: India's faceoff with China in Sikkim is a sign of the future** 

 ______ 
In Kashmir, shells and bullets regularly fly back and forth across India's de facto border with Pakistan . Yet, although India's 4,000-kilometer border with China is similarly disputed, not a single shot has been fired in anger there for decades. That may soon change: There are genuine fears in New Delhi that the long period of calm may not last. And whether it does or not, the latest standoff in the Himalayas is sure to change India.A weeks-long confrontation on the shared border between China, India and tiny Bhutan -- the sort that barely makes the headlines outside the countries involved -- has lasted longer than usual, and neither side looks ready to back off. Troops have had shoving matches and now stare one another down from encampments just miles apart. Although previous confrontations have been quietly resolved, this time some Indian strategists believe China will soon be tempted to launch a limited punitive strike as a reminder of its military superiority.Clashes between India and China don’t usually matter to the rest of the world. Even when the two countries fought a short and bitter border war in 1962, the world’s attention was fixated on the brewing nuclear crisis in Cuba. While Indians have never quite forgotten our humiliating loss in that war, China has rarely chosen to remind us of it. This time, however, the usual chest-beating from India’s hyper-patriotic news media has been matched by similar noises from over the border. The state-controlled People’s Daily even posted a bellicose editorial from 1962 on its Weibo account.In Beijing, a few weeks ago, I got the clear impression from some Chinese policymakers and diplomats that they thought India was getting, well, a bit above itself. Unhappy about China’s big Belt and Road Initiative, India not only stayed away from President Xi Jinping's recent forum showcasing the project, but released a stinging denunciation of the principles underlying the grand infrastructure scheme. That same language found its way into the joint statement issued by U.S. President Donald Trump and Narendra Modi when the Indian prime minister visited Washington last month. And India has recently taken a harder line on Tibet and the border than it has in the past.For leaders in Beijing, this behavior seems inexplicable. I was repeatedly asked whether India had forgotten that its economy is five times smaller than China’s. Perhaps, one got the impression, India needed to be shown its place.The problem is that India does not quite know its place. This makes sense when one considers its vision of its past and its expectations of its future. Independent India inherited the Raj’s armies -- the peacekeepers of Asia and Africa -- and with them, the Raj’s self-image as dominant east of Aden. It has always viewed itself as at least China’s equal in spite of the 1962 loss -- and even as its northern neighbor raced ahead economically. That was a minor setback, Indians feel; eventually we'll catch up, once we sort our messy politics out. And meantime, why not behave as if we already have?For the first time, perhaps, a sense of disquiet about this assumption has crept in. Questions are being asked about whether India is, in fact, ready to play a bigger strategic role in the region. Defense spending has not kept pace with India’s economy; the government spends less, proportionally, on the military than it has at any point since 1962. Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer noted on Twitter recently that India is one of the very few countries spending more on infrastructure than defense. This is by design; Indian policymakers are convinced that a new highway strengthens the country more than another battalion would. They may be right, too.But it’s unlikely India will sit quietly in a corner. This is a young country, and impatient. When a billion people have been led to expect that they are a great power, they will demand their government behave accordingly. And so, whether or not we can afford it, whether or not it makes a great deal of objective sense to outsiders, our democracy guarantees that we won’t do what Deng Xiaoping’s China did and “bide our time.” Every time China appears to disregard or dismiss India’s capabilities -- actions which seem eminently rational in Beijing -- it merely hastens the day that India will step up and seek a bigger role, one that matches its self-image.Earlier this week, Australia’s foreign minister pointed out the stakes in New Delhi. “Military outlays in our region expanded by over 5.5 percent in 2015-16, easily outpacing the one percent overall global increase in military spending,"" Julie Bishop noted. ""By 2020, combined military budgets in our region are forecast to exceed $600 billion. Now this is significant, given U.S. expenditure is currently at $611 billion and Europe is at $334 billion.” And this is without India even seeking to live up to its conception of itself. The question for China soon won't be how the world manages its rise, but how well it manages India’s.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners)

**Reliance AGM live updates: Reliance JioPhone launches on August 15, price is Rs 0 but there’s a catch** 

 ______ 
Reliance Industries Limited AGM Live: JioPhone a truly revolutionary phone, says Mukesh Ambani.

Reliance Industries Limited AGM Live: JioPhone a truly revolutionary phone, says Mukesh Ambani.

Reports in Business Standard have indicated that Foxconn is manufacturing the Reliance Jio 4G VoLTE feature phone. Meanwhile Economic Times has quoted Intex as saying they are working with Reliance Jio on the feature phones, and these will come bundled with the services. A report on Gadgets360 NDTV said that Jio’s feature phone will run KaiOS, a forked version of Firefox OS, and it will also have its own app store.

**New 8% Pension Scheme, PMVVY, To Be Launched Today: 10 Things To Know** 

 ______ 
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will today formally launch the Pradhan Mantri
Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY), or a pension scheme, for senior citizens today.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier announced the launch of the scheme
exclusively for the senior citizens aged 60 years and above. Under this
scheme, senior citizens (60 years and above) in which they will get a
guaranteed interest of 8 per cent for 10 years. Financial planners say that
this pension scheme will offer more avenues to senior citizens to earn steady
regular income at a time of falling interest rates. LIC or Life Insurance
Corporation of India operated this scheme. The scheme is exempted from GST or
goods and services tax.

1) LIC started offering the scheme from May 4, 2017. The scheme will remain
open till May 3, 2017. The shortfall owing to the difference between the
interest guaranteed and the actual interest earned and the expenses relating
to administration shall be subsidised by the government of India and
reimbursed to the LIC.

2) PMVVY can be purchased offline as well as online through Life Insurance
Corporation (LIC) of India which has been given the sole privilege to operate
this scheme.

3) The scheme will provide an assured return of 8 per cent per annum payable
monthly (equivalent to 8.30 per cent per annum) for 10 years.

4) The pension is payable at the end of each period, during the policy term of
10 years, as per the frequency of monthly/ quarterly/ half-yearly/ yearly as
chosen by the pensioner at the time of purchase.

5) There is a minimum and maximum limit for investment in Pradhan Mantri Vaya
Vandana Yojana Scheme. The amount varies according to the pension payment mode
chosen. For example, under the yearly pension mode, the minimum amount that
has to be invested in the scheme is Rs. 1,44,578 and the maximum at Rs.
7,22,892. In monthly mode, the minimum amount that has to be invested is Rs.
1,50,000 and maximum at Rs. 7,50,000. For other modes, see the table below.

Accordingly, Rs. 1,000 will be the minimum pension amount payable monthly for
which Rs. 1,50,000 has to be invested. Similarly, the maximum monthly pension
shall be Rs. 5,000 per month for which Rs. 7,50,000 has to be invested. For
other modes, see the table above. (It should be noted that the ceiling of
maximum pension - pensioner, his/her spouse and dependants - is for a family
as a whole.)  
  
6) On survival of the pensioner to the end of the policy term of 10 years,
purchase price along with final pension instalment shall be payable.  
  
7) Loan up to 75 per cent of purchase price (amount invested to earn pension)
shall be allowed after three policy years to meet the liquidity needs. Loan
interest shall be recovered from the pension installments and the loan to be
recovered from claim proceeds.  
  
8) The scheme also allows for premature exit for the treatment of any
critical/ terminal illness of self or spouse. On such premature exit, 98 per
cent of the purchase price shall be refunded.  
  
9) On death of the pensioner during the policy term of 10 years, the purchase
price shall be paid to the beneficiary.  
  
10) Manoj Nagpal, CEO of Outlook Asia, says senior citizens should take
advantage of PMVVY pension scheme as well as another popular senior citizens
scheme called Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS). ""If one has to choose one
over the other, then the PMVVY is better as one has a longer time frame need
of 10 years while the SCSS is better for higher liquidity it provides,"" he
says. Though the interest earned from both the schemes are taxable, effective
tax planning and higher tax slabs can greatly reduce the impact of tax for
senior citizens, he adds.

480,"Time for Modi to show that he won't tolerate cow terrorism. Let's see if he has the gumption to ban organisations like Bajrang Dal. After all, PVN did it post the Babri demolition. ",2017-07-21 12:26:11
481,"Many trains, the same contractor is running catering service for last 10 years. Modi govt did not change that.",2017-07-21 13:11:09
482,"He is only an advisor and is 85 years old. 

The reason he isn't allow to retire is because it is good PR to have him in the team and bad PR for him to quit just now when there has been some criticism of Modi for hogging limelight and sidelining Sreedharan during the Kochi metro inauguration. ",2017-07-21 14:30:43
483,"Lol. We have a weak PM. Only if CM Modi was the prime minister, he would have shown hell to these fuckers.",2017-07-21 14:32:34
484,Also I trust Google way more than I do modi. Give him your personal data and his goons have checkmarked list of targeted people when riots go down. Google ads show you different types of razors if your search history has a razor. Kinda easy to decide between the two. ,2017-07-21 14:58:48
485,"&gt; Also I trust Google way more than I do modi. 

So govt just has to make laws like patriot act and make these companies cooperate and ask for biometrics?",2017-07-21 15:22:14
486,"Modi = BJP these days.

Remove Modi and BJP won't win a single election.",2017-07-21 15:31:45
487,More like Modi is the big villain for some guys. The Ravana of 21st century.,2017-07-21 15:34:07
488,"Just like Ravana, Modi too has upsides. The ""idea of India"" is not defined by textbooks or literature studies, but rather governed by the common man on the ground. I have seen a lot of mongering about majoritarianism here, but what I have seen in reality is that mostly everyone just wants to get on with their lives.

If it so happens that a brazen Hindu nationalist won for the first time in a long while, it should also occur to you that a significant section of Hindus are feeling persecuted. To ignore that is dishonest, and to continue ignoring that Hindus are feeling persecuted will give you a 100% sure shot formula to ensure that Hindutva forces will win again and again till India becomes a Hindu Pakistan.

So what liberals really need to be doing is to analyse and take positive steps to assuade fears of the common rural Hindus instead of playing politics with minorities (who are well protected under the constitution for now anyway!).",2017-07-21 15:39:45
489,Bada bhai will gather data on behalf of Modi kaka. What a masterstroke!,2017-07-21 16:18:40
490,"So all the geniuses in this thread are claiming that Modi/BJP ordered the hit on Savaliya?

What are the connections between the education mafia and the BJP? Are there sufficient links? Can this be proved?

Or are we to assume that anything bad that happens in the country is because of the BJP?

Please answer, I would like to know.

EDIT: Downvote me if you want, but it won't change the truth. Where's the concrete link between the ""education mafia"" and the BJP government? Answer karo, downvotes ke peeche mat chupo
",2017-07-21 16:23:41
491,"Yup. Indian government has stopped publishing economic figures and stopped responding to questions in Lok Sabha and arrested all anti-Modi journalists.

492,"Modi has already said that he has Jain friends in this business. The Hindutvaadi's problem is only with Muslims and Dalits. Like I have always maintained, meat is just another pretext for the Hindutvaadis to show the others their place.",2017-07-21 16:37:26
