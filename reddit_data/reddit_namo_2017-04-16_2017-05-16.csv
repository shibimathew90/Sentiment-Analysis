2,"BJP has made special 'clubs' in each state to make an inlet to find and nurture future supreme judges which can then be appointed. The last appointment ran into problems due to the same reason. At present they're not dominant but will be in sometime. Its funny that judges are supposed to be neutral and above politics, but the reality is so far from truth.

Being recently appointed to the CM position(something which initially didn't want to but then said he had to have full authority of being CM than just a deputy-CM) and then in 5 months to face a riot that ripped through his state with no prior hint of the possibility would've been a fumbling point for even [the army as it came a full 2 days late](http://m.ndtv.com/cheat-sheet/2002-gujarat-riots-no-conspiracy-narendra-modi-showed-alacrity-in-calling-the-army-says-court-545818)

Allowing the VHP a free hand was a bad move, but with even police members being reported to have not done anything (a common point used by the oppn parties while in reality police inaction in large scale riots is usually common in India) my guess is that he saw the VHP as a reliable task force. His post-2002 interactions with the VHP have been anything than warm (at times the VHP has even been vocal against Modi) which might stem from a possible regret of allowing the bundhs which the VHP asked for.",2017-05-01 18:46:33

26,"I dont think your reply really addresses what I said before. Anyway...

Look, I understand that you like Modi and think he has great intentions. You're saying that because he has great intentions, we should atleast treat him with respect and criticize constructively to act as support for our leadership instead of breaking its back.

I am all for respect and support for Indian leadership when its warranted. 

But what if I clearly see that the leadership is manipulating its people by - 
1. Emotionally charged propaganda
2. Lies
3. Artificial surveys on NaMo APP
4. Shameless self promotion

When someone asks for data on DeMo he is denied. Early doubters were hounded and called names by the top leadership.

All this insults the intelligence of every person that voted for him and yet nobody realizes this (which to me is just baffling). It speaks volumes about his ""great intentions"".

With all this going on, how can anyone criticize constructively because even for that, you need access to information which you're being denied?

Its like - you can criticize in mild words but only if you first pledge your undying support to the dear leader. 

NO. I cannot pledge my undying support to anyone. Their actions will define my support and in this case Modi has proven that he doesn't deserve it.

Congress will run itself to the ground with their obsession to the family , and Tharoor is one of the few who'll emerge relatively unscathed from the ruins. ",2017-05-12 13:26:12
