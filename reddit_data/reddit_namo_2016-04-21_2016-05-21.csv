4,"&gt;  This negative news nonsense has to stop. Unfortunately that is what sells these days.

so there is absolutely no problem then? everything is cheeri-o? no overpopulation, water shortages? no male-female ratio imbalance? nothing to worry about, I should go burn tyres in my garden while making love to my 17 wives, pumping out babies at record speed, maxing out my credit cards on buying more tyres while chanting namo namo?

7,"Sometimes I think people thought Modi was Superman saving babies from falling off of sky scrapers, stopping trains from colliding, and helping stalled 747 planes land on the ground. 

He isn't Hanuman. He's just the PM. He isn't going to come and help you when you chant Om namo Modi. 

This caricature of Modi is so juvenile and very telling of the left in India where they sling anything at him, and hope it sticks. But it only ends up looking childish. ",2016-05-05 00:09:59
8,"There are important things one should be asking. But not all of them are easy to ask.

Kid or kids. If yes, when. 12 months to 5 years later?

Living as nuclear family, or joint family.

Interest in religion / rituals / superstitions / customs

How modern / how traditional

Romantic and sexual past - if it matters to you. STDs are a real problem. And figuring out if the answer is honest, that's a tough one too.

Political views. She can't be a RaGa fan (or Mayavati / Amma fan) while you are a NaMo fan, right? Or vice versa.

Influence / power of inlaws in your marriage.

Want to work, or not. If wants to work, how strongly. A woman with a real desire to work staying at home, recipe for disaster.

10,"The following is an excerpt from his interview from 2013. You can clearly see that he is not what you claim him to be.

&gt;I don't see anyone else. NaMo is an outstanding politician and really world class in the way that he reaches out and touches his audience. Having said that, his politics are narrow and many people are wary of him. He needs to resolve their issues to be able to lead the discourse.

In fact, read the whole interview. No one in his/her right mind can come to the conclusion that you have about the guy. Modi-Toadies tend to hate every journalist who is not a fanboy.

Just yesterday you said the 164 statement obtained by Hemant Karkare against Sadhvi Pragya was [flawed](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/malegaon-blast-2008-nia-to-file-chargesheet-sadhvi-pragya-to-get-clean-chit/1/667118.html)

Now, the same 164 statements obtained from some are held aloft to nail ISIS rather than our belowed Hindu terror outfits.

&gt; * Congress today said the fresh chargesheet filed by NIA in the 2008 Malegaon blast case has put a question mark on Indias commitment to fight terror and demanded that the probe should be monitored by the Supreme Court.

&gt; * The NIA (National Investigation Agency) has become Namo Investigation Agency, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said at a press conference here while contending that the chargesheet appears to be aimed at decimating and demolishing the meticulous probe conducted by Mumbai ATS led by late Hemant Karkare.

&gt; * Sharma questioned the government whether, with the fresh NIA stance, it is negating Karkares sacrifice.

&gt; * it goes on to show that the earlier probes, charges which were filed and arrests made were all wrong.
