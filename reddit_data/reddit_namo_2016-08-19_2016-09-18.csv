NaMo - Gujju; Raghu - TamBrahmin --&gt; Constant Tussle for economic stability upholder supremacy. Checks and Balances in place, what one says the other refutes. Eventual economy is good, since they don't allow each other to stray from each other's deemed paths. 

Now,

NaMo - Gujju, Urjit - Gujju --&gt; ""Kem Cho Urjit Bhai? Hu kai socialist scheme launch karwana chu aney aani maatey bau paisa joiye chey.  Tame interest rate jara ghatwai do to. Aney ha, un Bank walon ne pareshan na karo. Bechara aapna hi aadmi lok che"".

12,"The Internet has a marvellous way of doing away with everything; fact, reason, critical judgement-the exclusion of everything except what they see on their screens. And what they see( for the sub mainly comprises of westerners) are Indians posting ridiculous shit on social media. It doesn't matter whether they're the popular kids on the block or not; ""they're funny since they don't know what they're doing"" is the general sentiment,which is what leads to all the mild racism on the sub. No matter what the post( the top post of all time on that subreddit is an Indian advising someone on how to approach his exam), the comments, while usually along the lines of ""that's so sweet"", always has an undercurrent of superiority. And I find people who derive humour entirely based on condescension( look for the Asif AMA on the sub) slightly disconcerting. 

All said and done, I left quora because it was being inundated with Indians asking questions repetitively along the lines of "" What's NAMO doing for the country"" , so I may be hunting with the hound and running with the hare here. ",2016-09-11 23:48:27

---

&gt; * Much has been made of Modis decision to skip the summit, considering that NAM counts Jawaharlal Nehru as one of its founding fathers.

&gt; * Indias engagement with the US has been a continuous process; in fact, we can even say PM Modi is reaping the harvests of previous regimes, says Pushpesh Pant, former professor of international relations at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

&gt; * The China issue is, in fact, raised by Harsh Pant, professor at Observer Research Foundation, while explaining why NAM is not so relevant to India today.

&gt; * In fact, to host the NAM summit, President Nicolas Maduro has reportedly shut down Margarita Island.
