Congress was in Centre during Noember 2013 Elections when Congress promised this, and BJP was and still is in power when this clear statement cum promise to provide full statehood to Delhi with help of Central govt was made.

37,"Assuming that Kejriwal is a to-the-bones-honest person (and I have no reason to believe otherwise), he still needs to realize that there are others around him who will NOT be so. And that does not mean that they are with BJP or Congress. There is dishonesty and corruption (to varying levels) everywhere. 

I think that after removing AAP focus on Swaraj, Internal Lokpal, Grass-root level decisions (basically all the nautanki pre Delhi 2015 elections) - the next thing they will stop blasting their horn is on corruption. 

Because, one fine day AK will wake up and realize (as he realized that Swaraj is myth) - that 100% corruption free administration is a myth. The best way to work is to keep it within manageable limits, and ensure that everyone focuses on development. 

And then he will realize, that he is either MMS 2.0 or NaMo 2.0 based on how much of a blind eye he is willing to turn towards corruption. 

Of course, I am assuming that though both these PMs were (and probably are) surrounded by varying levels of corruption - they are free from it, but know that they have to control it, and manage with it. 

The day Kejriwal realizes that (indirectly, he will start showing some maturity), we will have a new leader in the making. But, till then - it will be just painful - both for him, his followers, his opposers and everybody.

41,"&gt;&gt;""The speaker can convince most people of most things and himself of  almost anything.""

Unfortunately this applies to Kejriwal.

&gt;he still needs to realize 

That is not going to happen. He truly believes in his delusions.

&gt;he realized that Swaraj is myth

All he has realised is that he will not be able to deliver on it. So he has decided to hide it for now lest people list it in his list of broken promises. But he still believes in all the ridiculousness he was pushing.

&gt;And then he will realize, that he is either MMS 2.0 or NaMo 2.0 based on how much of a blind eye he is willing to turn towards corruption. 

AK wouldn't amount to MMS 0.001 or NaMo 0.001 even at his best. Both MMS and NaMo have worked their way through complex bureaucratic systems and know how to use the system to their benefit and reform it from within.

AK has a history of working against the system. Even while working with the Income Tax Dept, he choose to protest from the streets instead of trying to make things better from within. 

And since his vacation from the ITD, he's been a ""serial-entrepreneur"", he has started and run multiple ""social startups"", while he was adept at getting ""VCs"" to invest in his ideas, but none of his ""startups"" managed to achieve critical mass to survive on their own. Clearly shows that AK lacks the foresight/vision and other necessary skills to build a truly viable system.  He's just been a marketing machine that can sell ideas but never deliver on them. 

His ideas are like inexperienced software engineers whose  solution for fixing bugs in a proven existing system, is to dump the system wholesale and build something new and shiny using  totally unproven technologies and don't pause for a moment to consider all the new bugs that they'll be introducing with such a radical change.

Luckily for us, it's impossible to pull off such stupidity in Government. And Kejriwal is learning it hard way  that pointing out what is broken is easy but actually solving problems is hard work and he just doesn't have the skills or the temperament to do it.

&gt;  you'd notice that JDU is a party which has backed AAP it it's battle against the centre's vindictiveness and constant interference. 

Got it again. Center was meddling in Bihar and hence Delhi and Bihar are similar. I thought it was just plain old rivalry between Nitish and Modi after their fallout during pre-LS 2014 days. That fallout, the breakup after being together has got absolutely NOTHING to do with Nitish complaining of Center interference

&gt; Nitish Kumar has even had the balls to send Bihar police officers on deputation to the Delhi ACB.

Oh yes. I wonder what he was afraid of, that required those balls. Oh wait, He was afraid of some backlash from...someone, somebody. Someone was going to walk to the Bihar CM and ask him why he sent police officers to Delhi. Yep, that required guts.. And it had absolutely NOTHING to do with NaMo and Nitish history. 

&gt;  And now they've illegally installed their own pliant chief Mukesh Meena.

Oh, they should have had someone with a more stiffer back, like someone whom AK deems fit. Got it

&gt; They're merely employing the age old Congress tactic of impairing an organization by keeping it understaffed. They do it with the election commission, information commissioners, and did it with ACB. 

Got it again. BJP Bad, All BJP decisions bad, All BJP decisions corruption based, All BJP leaders hypocrites. 

&gt; Unfortunately for them AAP govt isn't going to wait for things to happen. They're here to tackle corruption headlong.

Got it again. And the way to do that, is to support a alliance of Congress, JDU, RJD, SP, JDS, INLD. Because obviously, all of these are epitomes of corruption free governance for decades.

Oh wait, but before I speak too much and you correct me. I assume AAP is going to campaign for the complete alliance ? Or are they ONLY going to campaign in those areas where JDU is fielding candidates, since JDU has ""balls"" similar in size to AAP balls to take on ""center interference"". Have the other parties also done ballsy actions against the center, for them to considered fit for AAP campaign? 

Oh Wait, now I get it.

Just so that you are reminded of the current affairs - Modi is the only PM to have extended overt support to Tibetian government in exile by extending an invitation to the tibetian PM in exile.         

I cant remember any other Prime Minister in recent history who've visited Arunanchal so many times in over a year and the February 2015 visit being the latest in the series that have clearly irked the chineese as is evident from their reaction.     

Not to forget the ""expansionist mindset"" dig coming directly from horse's mouth while in Japan ,Chinese government and media were left defending the causes of their aggression so much so that i remember someone coming out and saying something along the lines - ""we have not and will not wage a war for any single piece of land that is not ours"".

66,"Yes. This country has a love-hate relationship with Congress. Like a bad son, they get removed from the house for few years, but when they come crying back - they are always welcomed back.
(For those you don't believe me - and one of my earlier posts was down voted. At this time RaGa's relative stupidity is his strong point. He is trying to come across that - see I am not ultra smart like that Modi, but I care. I am like your son who wants to come back and serve you. And if you feel that is not happening, see what he has been doing for the past few months. Playing that role to the line. In fact, IMHO he has already turned his shortcoming into advantage. Wait and see, if you don't believe me yet)

Coming back to the point - Fact of the matter is - that by not having any single ideology defining the party - Congress have managed to appeal to everyone (when the time is right). 

The Hindus (""We are corrupt, but we do some work"")

The Muslims (""We won't kill you"")

The Poor and Backward classes (""Here take some freebies"")

Basically, the ONLY thing which matters to Congress is staying in power - I would say even more then corruption. There is a limit to how much you can do corruption - but there is no limit to favoritism and soft power over other people - so what they do is build life long relationships with the corrupt who will save them when the need arises. It will take a couple of decades of non-Congress rule to weed out and let such relationships die. Too bad, Congress is usually back in much lesser than a decade and they nurture those relationships again. 

No need to wait for 2024. I see it happening in 2019 itself. Every single party is going to come together to defeat BJP in 2019. They won't take the risk of going alone. 

These 4 years are the do-or-die years for NaMo and BJP. And he knows it. He knows it all too well. Too bad some idiots within the party do not realize this and spoil the whole show by some stupid remarks. 

But, the good thing is that BJP is transforming itself. You can already see the hit jobs within the party to remove the ""weak"" ones. If BJP does this transformation, and win 2019 - they will continue much longer. Of course, with that transformation India will see much newer heights of crony capitalism (I mean it more like extreme lobbying, but feel free to twist it to ""BJP is Adani agent"" crap) - but at least the country will have hopefully something to show for it.  

Till then, we see what happens in Bihar. ",2015-06-24 15:02:41
