I am not really against any of these two, but he has a blind obsession for them. I can't even say that he is immature. He is 24 and should have the brains to draw the line between admiration and mindless fanboy-ism. On top of it when i try to talk some sense into him, guess what he says - Freedom of Expression!! I wish he wasn't 6'4"" because i really want to hit him.",2016-07-20 00:37:55

5,That is true. I feel afraid to correct my friends on whatsapp and fb who do namo namo all the time. I am also afraid to post anything here that would imply that i like being a hindu. Rhetorics of muh kulcha and muh sanskar flying around everywhere,2016-08-03 11:55:03
6,"&gt; And that would be in your opinion, I presume? 

It's common sense.  

Consider this   

- Currently manufacturing states get more money than consuming states.   

- Post GST this would be equalised.   

- However, if manufacturing states lose revenue, they are not going to agree.  

- So govt is going to compensate them for their losses for 3-5 years.     

- So consuming states will get more than what they used to get earlier &amp; manufacturing states will get the same as before.   

- Where the fuck is this extra money going to come from?   

- Obviously from us.   

- The GST rate will have be such that it will have to provide more tax revenue than before   

- Ergo, items will be costlier for us.    

- We are going to be butt-fucked for 3-5 years minimum.   

- By the end of 3-5 years we will be used to being butt-fucked.   

- We may even start enjoying it.   

- We can chant Namo, Namo while being butt-fucked.

7,Being prime minister and have your party government in many gau rakshak intensified state some strong action is also expected. Appreciate the struggle of dalits which have pushed namo to criticised cow vigilantism.,2016-08-07 02:08:11
8,"This is the math.  

- Consuming states will get more revenue than before.   

- Producing states will get less revenue than before. Hence Govt will compensate them for the lost revenues. So they will get same revenue as before.   

So if producing states get the same revenue as before &amp; the consuming states get more revenue than before where will the extra money come from?   

If will come from us.   

- We are getting butt-fucked.   

- We are chanting Namo, Namo while getting butt-fucked.   

- Hence we will enjoy getting butt-fucked.
