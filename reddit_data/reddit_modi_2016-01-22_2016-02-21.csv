0,"Prime Minister Modi is facing severe criticism for what is widely perceived to be his personal failure to bring back jallikattu as promised in time for this year’s Pongal festivities. After Modi tweeted his Pongal greetings to the people of Tamil Nadu, he was mercilessly pilloried on social media. T

---

&gt; * Unmindful that his advice to the state government constituted contempt of court, hetold the Tamil Nadu chief minister that since the Supreme Court had banned jallikattu, she should give jallikattu a new name and pass an ordinance.

&gt; * First, jallikattu supporters declared that the ban on jallikattu was an international conspiracy to kill all our native breeds because if there was no jallikattu, the bulls would all be sent to slaughter and the conspirators wanted India to be the worlds largest supplier of beef.

&gt; * From ministers in the Modi government, their national spokesperson and state BJP leaders to Hindu activists and Tamil chauvinists, animal activists have been vilified, abused, taunted and questioned with identical accusations.

&gt; * The Modi sarkar must know that the Supreme Court order banning jallikattu in May 2015 has taken this possibility, too, under consideration  that governments may be tempted to tweak, amend or make laws to overturn the judgement.

&gt;* Once again, fingers are being pointed to the man himself -- the invincible Modi (of course, until Delhi and Bihar happened) -- who single-handedly guided the BJP to a landslide victory in May 2014 defeating the Congress party, which weakened by allegations of corruption and policy paralysis.

&gt;* There are global factors at play too (such as the pain inflicted upon oil producing countries due to freefalling crude and the trouble brewing in China) that are beyond Modis control.

&gt;* As a matter of fact, there has been little progress on big ticket reforms (in tax, land and banking), which has clearly tested the patience of investors and rating agencies.

&gt;* Weak private sector participation, sluggish credit growth and banks stretched balance sheets continue to be the main pressure points, Rao of DBS said.

&gt;* For one, the stress on the bank balance sheets due to high amount of sticky assets and paucity of capital have clearly impacted banks ability to lend further, in particular to industries, which is critical to reboot the economy.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi may look to press the reset button on his leadership this spring to reinvigorate stalled economic reforms and appease critics, eyeing a mix of tried and tested allies and fresh blood, senior government sources said.The government has overseen rapid economic growth but failed on tax and land reforms, and the euphoria that met Modi's 2014 election triumph has given way to investor disillusionment; stocks have erased all of their gains since he won power.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) faces a crucial election test in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh in 2017 that it probably needs to win if it wants to hold on to power nationally in 2019.

&gt; * It will be too late if he fails to do it now,"" said veteran newspaper editor and commentator Shekhar Gupta.With an eye on Uttar Pradesh, Modi looks set to keep Amit Shah on as BJP president, the sources said, extending his closest aide and election campaign manager's tenure by three years when it expires at the weekend.But finance minister Arun Jaitley, responsible for delivering the Modi message to international investors, may move to defence after he delivers his annual budget in late February, sources said.Jaitley, 63, has failed to push through a major tax reform and critics have faulted his stewardship over India's $2 trillion economy, which is growing fast but not creating enough jobs to employ an expanding workforce.A spokesman for Modi declined to comment on the move and an official in Jaitley's office said he had no knowledge of a possible reshuffle.Moving Jaitley to defence, a post he also held in the early months of the Modi government, could better suit the veteran corporate lawyer and keep the strategically important portfolio in trusted hands.It would also open the way for power and coal minister Piyush Goyal to take the finance portfolio, while underperformers in other minor posts may be weeded out.A central minister and two BJP officials said Goyal, 51, was being groomed for his next big role, and a white paper on banking was recently shared with him to seek his inputs.

10,"Ashok Vajpeyi is one A grade turd and a massive Congi.

[http://www.outlookindia.com/article/the-literary-mafia/200102](http://www.outlookindia.com/article/the-literary-mafia/200102),

&gt;&gt; The same year, culture czar Ashok Vajpeyi got an Akademi award. Not only that, the poet-bureaucrat from Madhya Pradesh, presently a joint secretary in the Culture Department, was also conferred the first Dayawati Modi Kavishekar award (cash prize: Rs 2.51 lakh). 

Basically fucker gets himself close to Arjun Singh, and then gets into posts of importance in the cultural departments AND then awards himself prizes. Such a fucking farce.

&gt;&gt;The composition of the two juries that conferred the awards on Vajpeyi was questionable. For instance, the Modi award jury had little to do with contemporary Hindi poetry and comprised Ananthamurthy, Sanskrit scholar and former Navbharat Times editor V.N. Mishra and journalist V.P. Vaidik. The latter two are close to Vajpeyi and are believed to be helping him catch the next flight to the PMO-after his patron Ajrun Singh's exit, he is said to be feeling somewhat orphaned in the Madhavrao Scindia-led HRD Ministry.

So how does he get the ""award"", he appoints people close to him, those who might not even be Hindi literature critics and they nominate him. Farceing intensifies.

How did he get to these positions of power?

&gt;&gt;A promising Hindi poet in the '60s, Vajpeyi joined the IAS in 1965. Consistently patronised by Arjun Singh in Madhya Pradesh, Vajpeyi's power grew when Arjun Singh became chief minister in the '80s and he became the state culture secretary. He set up 11 cultural institutions, 10 of them in Bhopal itself. These extended his influence beyond the literary sphere into the visual and performing arts. His was the last word in the appointment of their trustees and office-bearers.

This asshole, who protested against ""intolerance"", in the same year as the Sikh genocide AND the Bhopal Gas tragedy, hosted a kavi sammelan IN Bhopal,

&gt;&gt;Controversies-such as those stemming from his decision to host the World Poetry Festival in December 1984 (when Bhopal was still reeling from the infamous gas tragedy), or to divert to culture funds earmarked for social welfare--failed to shake him.

Why does he hate the BJP?

&gt;&gt;He remained extremely powerful till he was unceremoniously shunted to the state Revenue Board when the Sundarlal Patwa led BJP government came to power in Bhopal in 1989. But mentor Arjun Singh came to his rescue, this time as HRD minister, and brought him in as joint secretary in the Culture Department in 1992.

Want a snapshot of the incestuous relationships in positions of importance that took place during Congress Raj?

&gt;&gt;Whether by coincidence or design, the past few years have seen major upswings in the fortunes of his kith and kin. Shortly after Arjun Singh became HRD minister in 1991, Vajpeyi's sister-in-law Kirti Jain, who was then officiating as director of the National School of Drama, was formally appointed to the post (despite the fact that her contribution to theatre is negligible and she has directed only one NSD play). Snide asides have been made at his father-in-law and ex-NSD director, Nemichand Jain, getting a big Ford Foundation grant and about the 'spurt' in the number of his published works since 1992.

&gt;&gt;Vajpeyi's poet-brother Udayan, who had earlier held the Asia Poetry Chair at Bharat Bhawan, recently received an Akademi fellowship. Last year witnessed a controversy over Vajpeyi's 26-year old son Kabir being appointed to the post of ""eminent architect"" by the Lalit Kala Akademi, which he declined after adverse press reports. And at the recently concluded Avignon festival in France, Vajpeyi had Kathak danseuse and close friend Prerna Shrimali dancing to the themes of his poems while noted writer B.V. Karanth was sent as her 'stage manager'.

Father in law, sister in law, brother, son, everybody gets posts and positions and awards! Fuck merit.

And these fuckers are all considered ""intellectual"" and apolitical and we are supposed to take them seriously.

This fucker calling out the Akademi is a fucking Mummers Farce!

&gt; * NEW DELHI: A day before BJP re-elects Amit Shah for a second term as party president, PM Narendra Modi will be meeting Shah and his team of office-bearers over dinner on Saturday at 7 Race Course Road.

&gt; * Shah's election is slated for Sunday.The meeting between the PM and the party leadership is significant, as under the new Modi-Shah regime the government has been functioning in coordination with the party to ensure that the government's policies reach people through its cadres.At a juncture when the going has not been all that smooth for the one-and-a-half-year-old Modi government with stalled legislations, rising prices and poll defeats in Delhi and Bihar, the need for better coordination between the party and government has become even more crucial.The BJP president's election, which should have been completed by December 2015, was delayed as the party was waiting for elections to the state units to be completed.

&gt; * Party rules warrant elections to at least 50% of the state units to be be over before election of the party chief takes place.The three-year term started by Shah's predecessor Rajnath Singh ended in December.

&gt; * ""Another five are ready to complete the process any day now,"" a party source said.Before Shah's election to his first full three-year tenure as BJP chief, the party was keen to have big states like Ra jasthan, MP, Gujarat, UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka to complete the process to organisationally strengthen his position.The leadership in the poll-bound states of West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu have been nominated, in this round, as is the norm.But many of the important states for BJP like Bihar, Jharkhand or Delhi may not be able to conduct polls before Sunday .Shah, at present, is serving half a tenure, having taken over from Singh, who became a home minister in the Modi Cabinet.

---

&gt;* India is set to get new insights into the life of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi releasing 100 new files pertaining to the freedom fighter on his birthday on Saturday, 23 January.

&gt;* An official statement from the Ministry of Culture said the move is expected to ""meet the long-standing public demand to access these files; it will also facilitate scholars to carry out further research on Netaji"".

&gt;* There have, however, been repeated calls from different quarters for the government to declassify other documents pertaining to the founder of the Forward Bloc, in hopes that they would shed light on his end, which is still shrouded in mystery.

&gt;* Modi, in his meeting with some members of Netaji's family in New Delhi on 14 October, 2015, had announced that the government would declassify files pertaining to him and make them accessible to the public.

&gt;* Subsequently, the first lot of 33 files was declassified by the Prime Minister's Office and handed over to the National Archives on 4 December, 2015.

49,"&gt;They've made some attempts to do that as well. They've made it harder for income tax department to send notices to people without enough sufficient data so that resources and time are not wasted. But yeah more efforts need to be taken

In my opinion corruption should be the number one priority and on this was one of the main issues in the last general election. Why such a lax attitude now? This has to be dealt on war footing.

I was thinking modi will start fresh recruitment in the IT dept as it is know IT dept lacks staff and go after tax evaders. Make everyone file taxes whether they earn or not. This is already there but not enforced. Make citizens who dont file taxes pay penalty and things of that sort.

&gt;You know that is too much to ask considering how different we are and how things are here right now. Give it some time, things will improve

I'm not asking for things to change overnight. Its unreasonable and no one would expect that. Unless one is a total idiot. What I want to see tough measure to check tax evasions. Tax notices sent to all small medium businesses left right and center. Tax audits and IT Raids. It should be everyday news in the local papers. And I want to ROI on taxes. CBI should raid MLA, corporaters and local muncipality and keep a check on the state governments on misappropriation of central or state funds. Let the CAG audit state governments and give a yearly report to the centre. 


&gt;Allocations in defence are quite reasonable. 

Defense allocations are reasonable, but hey, give some attention to BSF, modernize them. Seal the border. Whats the use s400 when terrorists are infiltrating from the border? What are the priorities of the ARMY? 

Army is also in desperate need of new automatic rifles, combat gear and boots. Police reforms, arm them with modern weapons and communication system to fight local crimes. 

&gt;They took quite some actions against hoards and tur dal worth around 2.5k crores was seized two months back. But the supply of pulses is too less and hence prices are bound to go up. For two years rains haven't been sufficient and several areas are drought hit so not much can be done there.

Its the main source of protein for vegetarians, egg prices are also up. Where do I get my cheap protein? That is why I said the government can pass on the low petrol prices to consumers for a short respite from the inflation. Let them start a nationwide TAX auditing program. Make it compulsory to file taxes or face penalty. Stop corruption at IT depts first. Its well known tax evasion takes place with the knowledge of IT officers.

&gt;P.s. not bad questions. Expected to find some anti- BJP person not interested in hearing anything but I'm happy it wasn't so

&gt;* A third commission of inquiry and many people, including some of his relatives, have contested that theory.Over a dozen members of the Bose family will be present when the PM will make public the files at an event in the national capital today.But a grandnephew of the leader, Harvard historian Professor Sugata Bose is not expecting much.

&gt;* ""Tragically, Netaji died on the battlefield, fighting for India's freedom, when the Japanese military bomber crashed at Taipei on August 18, 1945.

&gt; * Dalit student who protested against Modi evicted from guesthouse

&gt; * Dismissing any accusations of a publicity stunt, the two said they decided to stage a protest against Mr. Modi when they could not longer bear his silence around the death of Rohith Vemula.

&gt; * While the suicide of Vemula was the trigger to their outrageous protest, the Dalit youth say it was borne out of their growing frustration with the saffronisation of educational institutes under the NDA government and its indifference towards Dalit students.

&gt; * Through our protest, we wanted to call out every atrocity faced by students like Rohith, Mr. Arya said.

&gt; * Seychelles Islands"" were considered.However, he analysed the extreme impact it would have on the Indians in India and abroad and warned of a volatile situation in case of his trial and finally suggested that keeping Bose ""out of sight would be to some extent out of mind and agitation for his release might be less"".Mudie's letter and the note are among the 17,000 pages of secret documents in 100 files relating to Bose declassified and made public by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.The letter was in response to Jenkins' communication to Mudie, saying His Excellency the King would want him to analyse and advise on how to deal with Bose, the men of the Indian National Army and his civilian supporters across the length and breadth of the country.

&gt; Nehru was a man in a hurry to create the structure of a Modern State and a strong and forward looking economy. Power, transportation, healthcare, education, science and technology, our cultural heritage, participative rural development -- there was hardly any sector which Nehru did not cover. Parallel to the normal governmental administration was created a development administration to service the new Community Development Programme. The Civil Service was re-oriented to administer in the public interest rather than to merely rule. Nehru called for the building of the New Temples of a resurgent India, including huge dams for irrigation and hydel power, large thermal and hydro based power stations, steel plants, aluminium plants, copper and zinc plants, transportation systems, reinvigorated agriculture and educational institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, the Indian School of Mines, massive Agriculture Universities, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the public sector which glavanised and synergised the economy.

&gt; Nehru was Prime Minister for seventeen years, a long tenure for the Prime Minister, but a very short episode in a country’s history. Twelve of these years can be called the core years because that is when the sinews of a strong economy and a modern nation were built. One can think of no comparable example, not even in the Soviet Union, of a country on the move in which Bhakra-Nangal, Hirakud, Chambal were built, Bhilai, Rourkela and Durgapur steel plants made operational, five IIsT and four IIsM, Punjab Agriculture University and the G. B. Pant Agriculture University were set up and India started making modern cars, aircraft and warships. If Modi can achieve even a fraction of this in the single matter of purifying the Ganga that would be praiseworthy. In the matter of Nehru’s achievements, I would rate them as miraculous.",2016-01-24 04:24:18

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Last Independence Day, PM Narendra Modi took his security detail unawares when he broke the cordon to meet children on his way out of Red Fort.

&gt;* The inputs are understood to have said that boys aged 12-15 and trained in weapons and explosives may have sneaked into the country, triggering a high level of preparedness.

&gt;* The alert was issued on Friday and circulated among SPG, police and intel units in NCR.Following intelligence inputs of potential child squads targeting PM Modi on Republic Day, the SPG and senior advisers have been briefed and it has been urged that the PM not breach the security cordon.The Delhi police has been asked to keep a watch for possible suspects on R-Day.

&gt;* The cell has received an anonymous communication related to the present threat, a source said.The IS has recently released videos showing children learning to use machine guns and rocket launchers apart from rigorous physical training.

&gt;* One of these is Ansar-ud Tawhid (AuT), which has been helping IS spread its wings in India.TOI had reported earlier that security threat assessment has been on an all-time high.

118,"Like Rahul Gandhi, Modi Government Mishandles Student Protests

---

&gt;* Friday evening, RPN Singh, Congress leader and former Junior Home Minister, told the media that the PM does not realise the power of the youth which can wreck powerful governments.Singh was replying to a question on the Modi government's handling of the suicide of 26-year-old Phd student Rohith Vemula, which has sparked nationwide protests and outrage over the insensitivity shown in dealing with the case.Singh would know well the veracity of his statement for the youth of India gave a scathing and fitting indictment of the UPA with protests over the misuse of power and the then government's many errors including its handling of the Nirbhaya case.Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who was booed at Jantar Mantar by protestors when she visited the area to show her solidarity over the Nirbhaya case, could vouch for this.One can well remember the television visuals that showed images of the Chief Minister protected by police officials before she was surrounded by protesters who shouted slogans like ""Sheila Dikshit wapas jao"" (go back).Dikshit had made indifferent and inadequate statements over the gang-rape of a young doctor-in-the making, Jyoti Singh.Jyoti, or Nirbhaya as we call her now, lost her life to the callousness of a dispensation which had put women's safety on the backburner despite an increase in rape cases.

&gt;* She claimed in the Delhi Assembly that ""only one gang rape"" had taken place during her regime.As student protests got larger and angrier, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi tried damage control by reaching out to the family of Nirbhaya; the government then sent her to Singapore for treatment, but she did not survive.

&gt;* In January, the five moved out of their hostel rooms to a tent they set up on the campus and began a hunger protest soon after which Rohith committed suicide, perhaps realizing the futility of fighting a lost battle in a country where all political parties are in a frenzy to appropriate Ambedkar but not his children.As an aside to jog the BJP's memory, Ambedkar had faced the worst of criticism at the hands of RSS ideologue and then BJP member Arun Shourie in his book ""Worshipping False Gods.

&gt;* ""Last year, the RSS mouthpiece denounced Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University as an anti-national den while the HRD ministry in May 2015 took action against the Ambedkar Periyar Study circle at IIT Chennai for allegedly ""spreading hatred"" against the PM.

&gt;* From waging a direct, unpopular battle with the students of the Film Institute to the Rohith Vemula tragedy, we have gone one step further in alienating minorities and dissenting young minds from the mainstream.

&gt;* Criticising the recent killings of eminent scholars and writers and the 'inability' of the administration to prevent such hooliganism, noted historian Ramchandra Guha said the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the ""most anti-intellectual"" the country ever had.Expressing concerns over increasing threats to freedom of expression, Mr Guha came down heavily on the BJP-led government for being ""hostile"" to the writers' community ""This government is arguably the most anti-intellectual (administration) we ever had,"" he said while delivering the first Vijay Tendulkar Memorial lecture at the Mumbai University last evening.Mr Guha, however, said this kind of behaviour was not peculiar to the Modi government alone but across the board.

&gt;* ""All three (rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, CPI leader Govind Pansare and writer and scholar MM Kalburgi) were killed by rightwing Hindu groups for expressing their views ,"" he alleged.

&gt;* ""Both the Congress and BJP could have prevented these murders as these killings happened when either the Congress or the BJP was in power in the state or the Centre,"" Mr Guha said.Talking about the rising culture of banning anything and everything at the drop of a hat, the historian warned that the nation was ""slipping down to anarchy"", while describing the present-day India as a 40:60 democracy.Mr Guha blamed former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi banning Slaman Rushdie's Satanic Verses in the late 1980s as the root cause of the 'ban culture' in the country.He was quick to add that people today are eliminated for expressing their views and not just getting them exiled or their word banned.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: A hundred secret files relating to Subhas Chandra Bose made public by PM Narendra Modi on the 119th birth anniversary of the freedom fighter on Saturday do not throw new light on much of the existing narrative on Netaji, except for a Cabinet note of February 1995 saying he had indeed died in an air crash in Taipei on August 18, 1945.

&gt;* ""There seems to be no scope for doubt that he died in the air crash of August 18, 1945 at Taihoku,"" said the note, adding that the government had accepted that position.In fact, bulk of the secret Netaji files made public on Saturday relate to hundreds of petitions and demands for fresh inquiry into Subhas Chandra Bose's death made by politicians, family members and well-wishers from 1960s till now.A host of suggestions were made in these representations, including one by journalist Ashish Ray asking Narasimha Rao to get a DNA test conducted of the ashes of Bose kept in Renkoji Temple in Japan.

&gt;* Though bizarre, a suggestion by D N Sinha of All India Qaumi Ekta Committee suggested that bringing Netaji's ashes to India would fetch Congress an extra 10-20% votes.National Archives of India will release into the public domain digital copies of 25 declassified files every month.However, some of the declassified files give an interesting insight into how Jawaharlal Nehru's government treated Bose's legacy.Papers show that since October 1950 Bose's wife and daughter, based in Vienna, were being financially helped through various government channels, from the Indian mission in Switzerland to Nehru sending a cheque of 100 pounds to her.A note signed by Nehru (March 14, 1954) shows Rs 2 lakh were set aside for mother and daughter.

&gt;* It was proposed that a trust comprising Nehru, B C Roy and Bose's wife would be formed and that the money would be sent through non-official source like AICC.

&gt;* However, the file also mentions that one person who deposed before the Shah Nawaz Khan inquiry committee said the box was tampered with.Another file talks about letters from Lalita Bose who ran the Netaji Mission in Calcutta, writing to PM Morarji Desai to have a statue of Netaji in front of Red Fort, and have a public holiday in schools and colleges across the country on 23 January and also to provide land for the Mission, but the PM refused to oblige any of the three requests, giving his reasons in a polite letter.

131,"Which other mainstream media outlet has been openly making fun of Modi (not BJP/ not the government)? I mean real stingy satire, not the kind of safe cartoons (like unreal times )which are scared to poke the bear . Or is there nothing to make fun of?",2016-01-24 12:39:53
132,They have more brains than Modi and his cronies,2016-01-24 12:59:39
133,"&gt;Avalokiteswara is represented as both male and female in Indian sutras. In ancient India, it was conflated with both male Hindu deities like Vishnu as well as female deity Taara. In the same way, in China, it was conflated with Guan-Yin, the Taoist deity. Also, the word part is not ""Ishwara"", it is ""Svara"", meaning ""Voice"" and Avalokitesvara means ""One who hears the voice of the worlds"".

Guan yin is not taoist, I was told that She's a character from Chinese/East Asian folk religion. Taoism is about 天人合一(being one with nature) through meditation and 養生(health) and seeking guidance from elders which makes them separate from Chinese/East Asian folk religion as they believe you don't go to heaven or hell when you die and fade to nothingness. 
I don't see ASEAN natives like Thai or Malay animists changing Avalokiteshvara in any way, shape or form.

&gt;Because those ""Basic Concepts"" are not exclusive to Ramayana and Mahabharata. They come from Jataka Tales, which are stories of past lives of Buddha.

I've heard and chatted with acquaintances that the East Asian elites weren't too trusting of Indic culture/influences and hence their elites did everything they can to remove it from the public eye. It was written in their own history books too just that it's all in East Asian languages and shielded off from the western websites like wikipedia and so on.

&gt;Why should they be? Do East-Asians owe us anything for Buddhism, considering that India itself rejected the religion and switched back to Hinduism? They do acknowledge that Buddhism came from India, hate India for rejecting Buddhism, and they are adopting Buddhism into their own culture.
If anything, we owe them for preserving Buddhist sutras, because these sutras have helped Indian historians reframe the history of ancient India. Our knowledge of kingdoms of Magadha, Kosala, Anga etc. come largely from Buddhist Pali canon.

They just merely adopted Buddhism into their culture while the ASEAN natives incorporated and elevated Ancient Indian Hindu/Buddhist thoughts and cultures into their psyche and everyday lives.  Big difference. And the modern day East Asian is either an Atheist or a Christian as both are fast rising in their countries.
India is already out of their everyday discussion and everyday lives unless they are discussing rape, poverty and failed democracies(from taiwan news channel like TVBS for example if you understand mandarin). All the Indian politician/Modi talk about China and East Asia viewing India as the ""Land of Buddhas"" is utter BS and couldn't have been further away from the truth on the ground.

Similar to Europeans, They and their cultures are just too pragmatic and ruthless to be associated with. I just wish more people knew that instead of trying to kiss their A** by highlighting some vague ancient links and just leave our ASEAN brothers &amp; sisters in the ditch.",2016-01-24 13:00:41

&gt;* Celebrations broke out at the BJP office today long before Amit Shah was reelected the party's president in the presence of a large gathering of leaders.

&gt;* Seniors LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi were missing when Mr Shah was crowned again to the sound of conchshells and drums.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and several BJP chief ministers proposed the name of Mr Shah, whose re-election sets the stage for a number of big decisions by the party and the government, including an expected cabinet reshuffle.This will be Mr Shah's first full term.

&gt;* The 51-year-old, seen as a close confidante of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took charge as BJP chief in July 2014, midway during the tenure of Rajnath Singh who joined the government as Home Minister.PM Modi will host dinner tonight for party leaders including Mr Shah.Sources say the Prime Minister is expected to rejig his council of ministers once Amit Shah's team is ready.Led by Mr Shah, the BJP will soon plunge into its campaign for polls in five states later this year.

&gt;* During Mr Shah's previous term as BJP chief, the party came to power in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, but also suffered defeats in the Delhi and Bihar polls.BJP leaders say under Mr Shah's ""energetic and focused"" leadership, the party has expanded its reach in Assam, Kerala and West Bengal, three of the states that go to polls this year and where the party has never been a significant presence.Mr Shah is also expected to lead PM Modi's campaign in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

&gt;* The previous time, senior party leader Yashwant Sinha had expressed his willingness to contest but later decided against it.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: To scale up its offensive against the Modi government on the issue of minority status to AMU and JMI, opposition parties have decided to approach some NDA allies, who were earlier constituents of the United Front, as they plan to corner the government in Parliament during the Budget Session.MPs from Congress, Trinamool Congress , JD(U), RJD, NCP, CPI, CPI(M) and AAP had on Friday issued a joint statement condemning the government's move to ""strip"" Aligarh Muslim University and Jamila Millia Islamia of their minority status.They will now seek to forge a larger unity on the issue in Parliament when the Budget Session convenes next month.

&gt; * Many of them were with us during the United Front days and share the same view on such issues,"" JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi told PTI.Tyagi said efforts are on to ensure the issue is raised in a big way during the Budget Session so as to ""prevent"" the government from ""taking away"" the minority status of JMI and AMU.A meeting of MPs sharing a common view on this matter will also be held before the Budget Session to chalk out the strategy, the JD(U) leader said.Tyagi said that apart from MPs from the eight parties, which have signed the joint statement, ""Indian National Lok Dal has also decided to support us.

&gt; * We will now try to reach out to some NDA allies"".He said the issue is a ""larger one"" and ""not confined only to the minority status of JMI and AMU.

&gt; * We will carry out a signature campaign during the Budget Session itself,"" he added.Tyagi had earlier this month written to the President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding scrapping of the search committee set up to recommend names for the Vice Chancellor of Delhi University, alleging ""high-handedness"" and ""serious violations"" of norms and procedures.He had also submitted a note on ""violations of the statutes of Delhi University and JNU in the appointment of the Vice Chancellor"" and termed it a ""challenge to the autonomy"" of institutes of higher learning.In the joint statement on the issue of minority status for AMU and Jamia, MPs had expressed their ""displeasure and deep concern"" against the ""nasty"" move of the central government to ""strip"" them of their minority status.The MPs had also condemned the statement of the Attorney General Mukhul Rohtagi that the two are not minority institutions.In the joint statement, they had pledged to raise the issue in the forthcoming session of Parliament and ""fight"" for the basic rights of minorities as enshrined and guaranteed in the Constitution of India,"" and decided to reach out to ""all secular-minded political parties"".The Attorney General has told the government that Delhi-based Jamia Millia Islamia is not a minority institution as it was created by an Act of Parliament, days after he told the Supreme Court that the legislature never intended the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to be a minority institution.The HRD Ministry had approached the Law Ministry seeking an opinion on the issue.

&gt;* The situation in the state was discussed at an emergency cabinet meeting this morning chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the BJP began its process to re-elect Amit Shah as president.

&gt;* Sources say the government consulted the Attorney General and decided that the situation in Arunachal Pradesh amounted to a crisis that warranted central intervention.

&gt;* The turmoil began in Arunachal Pradesh on December 16 as 21 rebel Congress lawmakers joined hands with 11 BJP and two independent members to ""impeach"" Speaker Nabam Rebia at a makeshift venue.

&gt;* Nabam Tuki has alleged that Governor Rajkhowa, acting as a ""BJP agent"", helped the rebel Congress lawmakers in their attempt to topple his government by calling an assembly session ahead of time.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to go all out to welcome French President Francois Hollande to India.

&gt;* After all Hollande is the guest of honour at India's Republic Day, a privilege only a few heads of state get to experience.

&gt;* But Modi chose an odd way to do that by taking Hollande to Chandigarh, a city where apparently there was nothing else to show the French premier other than the airport and the city's unique, albeit not terribly exciting, rock garden.

&gt;* But the Indian prime minister decided to make up for that by still offering the sort-of photo-based hilarity that we have come to expect from him when dealing with the rest of the world, whether it involves a monogrammed suit or walking around terracotta warriors in China.

&gt;* Modi has something of a history in awkward interactions with foreign heads of state, from backslaps to ignored handshakes, and now there's a whole new addition to the list.

All modi hater are shallow, they can troll on 

1)Camera affinity  of Modi

2)Dadri Case 

3)Foreign Trips 

4) Manufactured chutiyas speaking chutiapa on TV and believing shit  pages like SUSU and truth of Gujrat.


I loose shit when the critics are not being critical.

191,"President's Rule In Arunachal Pradesh Amid Opposition Criticism

---

&gt;* New Delhi: Arunachal Pradesh has been placed under President's Rule a day after it was recommended by the cabinet in an unscheduled meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* The turmoil began in Arunachal Pradesh on December 16 as 21 rebel Congress lawmakers joined hands with 11 BJP and two independent members to ""impeach"" Speaker Nabam Rebia at a makeshift venue.

&gt;* 27 MLAs in the 60-member Assembly, including Chief Minister Nabam Tuki, boycotted the session calling it illegal and unconstitutional.

&gt;* A day later, the rebels and opposition lawmakers gathered at a community hall to ""vote out"" the Chief Minister and elect his replacement.

&gt;* Nabam Tuki has alleged that Governor Rajkhowa acted as a ""BJP agent"" and helped the rebel Congress lawmakers by calling an assembly session ahead of time.

&gt;* New Delhi, Jan. 25 (ANI): Senior Congress leader and lawyer Kapil Sibal on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah of being hand in glove with rebel Congress leaders to topple the government in Arunachal Pradesh.

&gt;* Addressing a press conference here, Sibal read out a transcript of a telephonic conversation between rebel Congress leader Kalikho Pul and a businessman that stated that the entire crisis in Arunachal Pradesh was pre-planned.

&gt;* Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh will be meeting President Pranab Mukherjee today to put forth the governments view this regard.

&gt;* The Congress had earlier dubbed the governments move to recommend Presidents rule as unconstitutional and alleged that it exposed the dictatorial tendencies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* Arunachal Pradesh was rocked by a political crisis on December 16 last year as 21 rebel CongressMLAs joined hands with BJPs 11 MLAs and two independents to impeach Assembly Speaker Nabam Rebia at a makeshift venue.

BJP has true inner party democracy and every leader from ABVP to Modi has faced resistance. Unsure of your logic here.

&gt;it was the PR machinery that made him out to be the second coming that turned the tide.

How does a state level CM, without a 570 crore budget to his aid somehow fight against established players like Advani? 

If you think the entire election and his popularity is all some media created hype - by a media who hated his guts and still do, I think we will never agree on a common meeting ground and best is to end the discussion here.

&gt;I went to 3 of his rallies, one where he was in person and two with the hologram, there were people who only heard of Modi in passing before, became his hardcore fans.

If we are doing anecdotes, I have heard, even in 2014 (before the elections) some villagers discussing Modi in a remote hamlet in TN - where outside of MK, Jaya and MGR no other leader is even considered talk worthy.

&gt;I mean who the fuck is kejriwal, just a CM of a small state, with a party which has no standing at national level, it was Modi as a PM who came down to Kejriwal's level in the Delhi election that boosted Kejriwal's level up.

Kejriwal had always been trying to clamour for Modi's attention. But yes, this I will concede, your point is fair.",2016-01-25 17:44:20

264,"&gt;That is the point he is trying to make, he critiques the Govt. Not people's policies, the Govt's policies. 

Which explains why he loudly critiqued Modi, an Opposition leader, rather than the government during the 2014 polls.

Idealogy has always trumped ideals for him, like most Leftist intellectuals.",2016-01-25 23:14:03
265,"When Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister 18 months ago, his huge electoral victory brought sky-high expectations that the country's economy, unshackled from the indecisiveness of the previous Congress-led government, would soar. Yet, as 2015 came to a close, the Indian economy was hardly flying high.

&gt; * Sadly, investment has not grown.

&gt; * One factor holding back investment is that major reforms, especially regarding land acquisition, simply have not happened.

&gt; * A second factor holding back investment is the continuing financial problems of Indian banks and of many large corporations.

&gt; * But, whatever the state of the global economy, the bottom line is that India cannot attain its potential without a strong revival in investment.

270,"My speciality in economics is economic history, to be precise, economic history of last century. Indian state has been *the* major obstacle in our growth since, well, forever. Tirathankar Roy, himself an economic historian compares market policies under British from 1857 to 1947 to the policies we carried on from 57 and says it's the biggest case of an economy closing down in recent history.

A lot of things which Indian state fucks up don't affect our life directly but change their course completely if you consider indirect effects. [Take this](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/delay-in-projects-completion-cost-railways-over-rs-1-lakh-crore-cag/story/227305.html) for example. India is still ranked 130 out of 185 states on economic freedom, who do you think is culpable? The poor market, growth, jobs etc. I can't even begin to start where and how Indian government has indeed screwed the economy from 47, Milton Friedman himself made some observations in 53 and 60. I, of course, know the relevant literature but I'd need a lot more time and a better frame of mind to explain.

Another example I can think of is public sector bank and NPAs. How do they affect our lives, you ask? They make taking credit for normal people difficult, why do you think banks aren't passing on the rate cuts from RBI to the customer? A normal person is unlikely to realize things like this, perhaps if he did, the situation wouldn't be same.

I'll try and put it like this, until as recent as 1986, India's per capita income was higher than China. Now, we can't even dream of getting close. 

As far as education goes, I favor state myself but more in primary education than higher. All the best institutes in the world are privately funded, India had regulations preventing private investment in education which is why we never had any prop up during early times. Indian education at higher is cheap but it's for a very, very few people. Compared to population size, the number of decent institutions we have is laughable and everyone except from tier 1 colleges needs to be retaught how to work. People from below tier 2nd are almost unemployable, there's a reason people apply in thousands and lacs for peon and sweeper post, even MBA, B.Tech and PhD holders. What good is education like that, even if it was cheap?

[17000 MBAs, B Techs apply for 114 sweeper jobs in UP](http://indianexpress.com/article/education/17000-mbas-b-techs-apply-for-114-sweeper-jobs-in-up/)

[3 lakh persons have applied against 368 posts of peon in the state secretariat. - over two lakh applicants are at least graduate with BTech, BSc, MSc and MCom degrees. Applications also include 255 candidates with a PhD degree in hand.

Health is another giant altogether. I will say, public sector healthcare in India is decent, it could be better.

&gt; I must confess I am not an economics student and most of my knowledge in the area comes from reading Smith, marx, hayek etc. 

People with historical relevance often not quite relevant in mainstream economic thought, Smith, of course, remains influential but the work has been improved upon. Hayek's philosophy is interesting, economics... err.

&gt; However, his ultimate goal seems to be a more market centric approach.

I never understood why Keynes got an anti-market reputation, he loved markets. He believed in capitalism and wanted to make it work better with intervention. Modi may say what he will, I follow policy and he's quite the opposite of minimum govt. They haven't decreased much regulation, trade barriers, or reduced compliance cost of taxes and regulation.

Almost every mainstream economist is market oriented, Piketty can rephrase his arguments for public discourse but even he is market oriented, as I quoted above. Also, almost every economist is a (New) Keynesian. :-) The old ideological debate has not existed for decades now, in the discipline, that is. It only exists in public discourse. For example, almost 45% of /r/Economics users subscribe to either Marxism or Austrian school, less than 1% of academic economists do. 

&gt; I am not sure, but doesn't neo classical also encompass these elements?

Neoclassical was microeconomics, it dealt with individual firms, people, industry and so on. See this - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_synthesis

Paul Samuelson laid foundations of the modern economic discourse. Friedmanites and free market oriented people are monetarists, his insights have been also incorporated in New Keynesian if not his policy prescriptions. There isn't all that much difference between Freshwater and Saltwater, except maybe a few normative disagreements.",2016-01-26 00:08:39
271,"Let me tell you this (as a person studying economics for a while now) I think the two statements you've made are ill informed. The distinction between what is neo-classical and neo-keynesian is not how Indians frame policy, but how economists think about effective policy measures.

Unless Modi actually comes out with clear work/literature denouncing + supporting claim(s) can you even begin to understand which wall he leans towards. 

To be fair, most (not all!) of what happens today, is *realpolitik*, and nothing more. So before we actually go on thinking about ideology, I think we'll have to make a fundamental distinction between what is ideological and what is not. ",2016-01-26 00:10:44
272,"And let me tell you something, no government is going to be a representative of a single theory. Its ridiculous to put such a proposition. But it would also be ridiculous to suggest that government is not leaning or more representative of an ideology.

One need not come out with a PHD thesis to do so. Policies and frameworks of government therefore are ascertained to certain schools of thought. Especially since Modi himself doesn't make policies but his advisors do. He then implements them according to what is convenient at the time and there yes there is some realpolitik involved but not so much so to suggest a Focault type ideologue.

Is that too hard for you to understand?

277,"I did not mean to offend. But yes, let me clear the air about what I meant earlier. I am not saying one needs to have a PhD to actually come up with a representative ideology. 

The branding of *Thatcherian* policies was first made when things went foul in the UK with a very displeasing M3 growth and low productivity. To get a sense of what the Thatcherian ideology You could read this:

*Sargent, Thomas J. ""The ends of four big inflations."" Inflation: Causes and effects. University of Chicago Press, 1982. 41-98.* 

If one were to look at Reaganomics, then we've actually got stuff written on that too, 

*Galbraith, John Kenneth. ""The way up from Reagan economics."" Harvard Business Review 60.4 (1982): 6.*

What you'll notice here is that these papers really came out once there was an established norm, that these heads of states pursued policies which have common threads attached to them. To be really honest, Modi (or his policy advisors) do not really tie policies on one big umbrella - and I mean those which concern the economy directly. So unless we've actually been able to establish a pattern to what Modi sir's actually upto, we shouldn't really be branding him into a Keynesian/Austrian/Neo-Keynesian/NTT/whatever..That's all.",2016-01-26 01:10:58

&gt; * The ministry has decided to exempt start-ups from inspections related to key labour lawsincluding the Industrial Disputes Act, the Contract Labour Act, the Employees State Insurance Act, the Trade Union Act and the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Actin a bid to dispel fear and encourage young entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses in India.

&gt; * Thus such start-ups, as defined by DIPP (department of industrial policy and promotion), may be allowed to self-certify compliance with the labour laws, labour secretary Shankar Aggarwal said in the letter.

&gt; * As per the labour ministry, start-ups will not be inspected in the first year of their establishment, and in the next two years, they will not be inspected until the central analysis and intelligence unit of the labour ministry verifies a written complaint and advocates any inspection.

&gt;* The leitmotif of the Indian political story between Republic Day 2015 and that of this year has been the fall of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, albeit in slow motion, from the exalted perch he had occupied so stunningly in May 2014.

&gt;* The suit, rightly or wrongly, conveyed the impression of a chaiwallas son having become enamoured of power, of flaunting expensive clothes in complete contrast to his rhetoric of working for the poor, of letting his electoral triumphs swell his ego to the point of becoming arrogant.

&gt;* Before Modi was to begin to his speech on Friday, three men stunned the audience  and the nation  by shouting slogans against him, in the hope of prodding the government to respond sensitively to the suicide of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad.

&gt;* But, really, why should people view Modi as arrogant, given his remarkable propensity to talk and tweet, his near-permanent presence in our lives, staring out of newspaper advertisements or from TV screens or delivering soliloquies to the nation on the radio?

&gt;* Nor did he express his disapproval of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley who described as a ""manufactured revolt"" the decision of writers to return to their Sahitya Akademi awards in protest against what they believed was rising intolerance in India.

&gt; * It was argued that like the separation of state and church, separation of state and economy was also needed for comprehensive, risk-free economic growth.

&gt; * Had the government been more conciliatory, its approach less arrogant, by now the GST, the measure reform that is thought to be a new trigger point, would have seen the light of day.

&gt; * To tide over the economy, the Indian state has to be more polite, it has to carry along all the stakeholders of the society, all the democratic institutions have to play an important role, and a very serious effort has to be made to make the Opposition realise that it is an important element in economic revivalism.

&gt; * To the Indian policy makers, I would like to quote Kaletsky again: Capitalism 4.0 will recognise that governments and markets make mistakes not only because politicians are corrupt, bankers greedy, businessmen incompetent and voters stupid but also because the world is too complex and unpredictable for any decision-making mechanism to be consistently right, so pragmatism must be the watchword in public policy. Mr. Modi, you need to be more pragmatic and you have to realise that an old instrument would not work in the new world.

---

&gt;* On 21 January 2016, addressing a packed hall of students and scholars at DelhisJawaharlal Nehru University, the French economist Thomas Piketty gave a talk in which he discussed the history of taxation, inequality and capital in the twenty-first century.

&gt;* Though his work on inequality fundamentally deals with the situation in the West, his argument holds good even in India, particularly in the context of the deeply entrenched caste hierarchy and the rampant culture of discrimination it spawns.

&gt;* Besides barring the Dalit students access to public spaces inside the campus, the Hyderabad University authorities also stopped Rohiths monthly fellowship of Rs 25,000, part of which he used to send home to his mother.

&gt;* We used to live in a lane in Guntur where, even today, only SC families live. My children are as much Dalit as I am, she asserted, scotching the BJPs attempts to dismiss Rohiths death as a non-Dalit issue, and to project him as a member of the OBC Vaddera caste to which his father belonged.

&gt;* In this process, two narratives have unfolded side by sideone representing the dignity of the grieving mother of Rohith and his family, and the other highlighting the inadequate response of the BJP leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to the incident.

&gt; * A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reassured investors that India would not change tax laws retrospectively, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley seemed to suggest that the Union budget he will present on 29 February would have its share of tax reforms.

&gt; * Speaking at the platinum jubilee celebration of the income tax appellate tribunal on Monday, Jaitley said the government is at an advanced stage of considering recommendations of the Parthasarathi Shome Committee set up to suggest changes in the tax regime to make it more taxpayer friendly.

&gt; * The tax administration and reforms committee, or TARC, set up under Shome by the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, submitted its report in June 2014.

&gt; * It has suggested many reforms in the tax administration itself, he said.

320,"&gt; Is the power really in the hands of the common man?

Of course. Didn't we throw out a government that was corrupt and brought in someone who promised action? But the reason I feel the common man seems to get a raw deal is because 1) our system is too decentralized, and 2) we (including the poor) consider state and for the upper classes, national politics more important than local ones. 

No matter how much Modi tries, he will not be able to bring microeconomic changes to a small population in a specific part of the country.

---

&gt;* As the Narendra Modi government declassified its files related to Subhash Chandra Bose on Saturday, it became clear to most historians that nothing of any great importance had been revealed in them

&gt;* As historian Ramachandra Guha explains here, the war criminal claim comes not from a letter by Nehru but from a mostly unknown witness seeking publicity before the Khosla Commission in 1970.

&gt;* Journalists such as Aditya Kaul apologised for falling for the fake letter, Rahul Kanwal deleted his Facebook post which had reported it and India Today deleted its original tweet where it had reported news about the letter.

&gt;* Social media is driven by controversy not fact and political vendetta ensured that Nehru was pilloried all day.

&gt;* But there was a backlash, as a smaller if more thoughtful set of users started to mock people who had fallen for the fake Nehru letter.

&gt;* India's next mission to Mars will have a French connection and the two countries could together attempt to put a lander on the red planet.

&gt;* A lander on Mars is not easy, but it will be interesting to undertake,"" Jean-Yves Le Gall, president of the French Space Agency CNES told NDTV.India and France on Monday forged a new friendship in space technology at talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande, who is on a two-day visit as the chief guest for Republic Day celebrations.Among the 14 agreements that India and France signed after the two leaders held talks yesterday was a letter of intent on CNES participating in the Indian Space Research Organisation or ISRO's next Mars mission, expected around 2020.Mr Le Gall said France would bring to the partnership its scientific expertise on the planets Mars and Venus.

&gt;* ""The 450-crore Mangalyan mission was launched on a homegrown PSLV rocket from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on November 5, 2013.In September 2014, ISRO successfully placed the low-cost Mars spacecraft in orbit around the planet in its very first attempt, breaking into an elite club of three - only the US, Russia and Europe had so far undertaken successful missions to Mars or its orbit.The Mangalyaan has spent more than 15 months orbiting Mars and is currently located around 200 million km from Earth.

&gt;* The Mangalyaan is in fine health, says ISRO as it orbits around Mars in a highly elliptical orbit making scientific observations of the atmosphere of the planet.If India and France jointly succeed in putting an object on the surface of Mars called a landing they would become the second nations to have done it.

334,"&gt;At first blush, it seemed I hadn’t travelled far at all. My first public colloquium was delivered in Urdu at the Maulana Azad National Urdu University in Hyderabad. With most females in burqa, and most young men bearing beards, **MANUU is more conservative in appearance than any Urdu university (there are several) on the Pakistani side.**
Relative to its Pakistani counterparts, it is better endowed in terms of land, infrastructure and resources.

Similar to the first generation NRIs who are are way more conservative compared to their indian family and friends

**Edit:** some explanation on what I meant above:

One would imagine that NRIs should be less conservative compared to Indians living in india but they are not.

Similarly, Indian muslims studying in indian universities should be less conservative compared to pakistani muslims studying in pakistani universities.

But they are not.

When faced with modern customs south Asians tend to become more conservative instead of merging with the new customs.

There's an INCREASE in air pollution levels in the last few months. The environmental agencies are alarmed at the rate of deforestation in recent months. Do you know why? Because people don't have cooking gas, so they are using firewood to cook food. And not just villagers in remote areas, no. Top level bureaucrats are doing this. 

Go to Nepal and you'll see people thanking the Modi government for improving the health of Nepalis. How? There is no fuel, so everyone has to walk everywhere. The news articles of decrease in International Crude Prices is a cruel joke to these guys, who have to buy petrol in black at NPR 450 per litre (approx INR 300 per litre). 

Go the the poshest restaurants in Kathmandu, and you'll see half the items in the menu stuck off. They don't have the raw material to cook those dishes. 

I was staying in a 4 star hotel last week. Had a minor cut while shaving and asked the reception for a band-aid. Nope, medical supplies not available sir. Many pharmacist shops are closed for weeks. 

So yes, there is a reason behind the frustration of the average Nepali. Do we know whether India is orchestrating this blockade? Nope, but it is very likely. (I'm an Indian by the way).

Now let me predict what's going to happen. The current Nepali govt. is going to crumble, and the previous PM is going to come back into power within the next 2-3 months. India will slowly remove the blockade and things will limp towards normalcy.

&gt;* This personalised message was sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to 18 lakh personnel of police forces and paramilitary forces on the occasion of the Republic Day.The message was sent from government's bulk SMS pool and was received from 'DZ-PMModi' sender link, according to a police official who received the message.The message was sent to the personnel ranging from the Director General rank officer to the constabulary, working with both state and central governments, as part of Prime Minister's initiative to connect with them.The link given on the said SMS takes an individual further to an Android-based mobile phone application which is a repository of his speeches and official activities as the Prime Minister.This is perhaps the first time that a Prime Minister has directly communicated to all policemen across the country.During the three-day conference of police officers held in Gujarat in December last year, Prime Minister Modi had expressed his desire to greet and wish each policeman of the country.After that conference, he had asked all state and central police DGPs and other police organisation heads to send to his office the list of contact numbers of all policemen before January 26 so that he could send the SMSes on Republic Day on their phones.

344,"EDF signs preliminary deal to build six nuclear plants in India

---

&gt;* French utility EDF said on Tuesday it had signed a preliminary agreement with Nuclear Power Corp of India Ltd (NPCIL) to build six nuclear reactors at Jaitapur, in the west of India.EDF is taking over the long-delayed project, which could become the world's biggest nuclear contract, from fellow French state-controlled group Areva, which will sell its reactor arm to EDF later this year.The Jaitapur project is at the preliminary technical studies stage after getting initial environmental clearance in 2010, EDF said in a statement.

&gt;* A contract for pre-engineering studies was signed by Areva and NPCIL last April.EDF said that in the next few months it would continue work started by Areva and NPCIL to secure certification for the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) reactor in India and to finalise the economic and financial conditions.The six 1650 megawatt EPR reactors with a combined capacity of nearly 10,000 MW would make Jaitapur one of the world's biggest nuclear sites and the contract, if finalised, one of the largest in the history of the nuclear industry.But Indian legislation on manufacturer's liability has long blocked French, US and Russian nuclear projects in the country.General Electric Chairman Jeff Immelt said in September that GE will not invest in atomic energy in India until accident liability laws are brought in line with global practice.With the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy in mind, India's parliament passed a law six years ago that makes equipment suppliers responsible for an accident.Strong local opposition to the project, haggling over price, massive delays and cost overruns at EPRs under construction in France and Finland and the takeover of Areva's reactor arm by EDF are also delaying the huge project.French President Francois Hollande, making a state visit to India, said on Monday that an agreement to build the six nuclear reactors should be concluded within a year.Hollande and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a joint statement they had agreed to hasten the nuclear talks and aim for construction to begin in early 2017.EDF also said its EDF Energies Nouvelles unit had agreed to a partnership with India's SITAC to build four onshore wind farms by the end of 2016 with a total capacity of 142 MW in the state of Gujarat.

---

&gt;* The company, which is 84% owned by the French government, was widely expected to undertake the project after it acquired a majority stake in Areva in July 2015.

&gt;* Much of that is due to a lack of interest from foreign reactor makers, who have objected to a law that holds manufacturers liable in case of an accident.

&gt;* In September 2015, for instance, General Electric decided not to invest in the nuclear energy sector in India over uncertainties regarding the liability law.

&gt;* In a joint statement issued by Hollande and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Jan. 25, the leaders said that they plan to conclude techno-commercial negotiations by the end of 2016 and to begin operations at the plant by early 2017. It is not clear how the companies will work out modalities regarding the liability clause.

&gt;* India currently faces a severe power shortage and the Modi government is looking at nuclear energy to bridge that gap and bring electricity access to some 300 millions Indians.

Not that it matters why you win or lose, but the BJP lost and will continue to do so going forward. 2014 was a watershed election and BJP had major anti incumbency going for it and benifitted from a vote split. Which it won't in 2019. Plus rural India is in a mess, just like it recently lost in rural Gujarat it will lose because of the rural vote on 2019. 

Furthermore once BJP looses it majority, the likes of Shiv Sena won't support the BJP, and they certainly won't support the Narendra Modi as PM. Their second biggest ally is Akali Dal, which will lose its seats to AAP . So thats 50 seats lost on allies. If they manage to create a coalition, it will be without Modi as PM. ",2016-01-27 16:11:15

&gt; * ""The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has given its approval for the Hybrid Annuity Model as one of the modes of delivery for implementing the Highway Projects,"" said a statement from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.Under this model, the government will provide 40 per cent of the project cost to the developer to start work while the remaining investment has to be made by the developer.

&gt; * ""Adopting such a model for projects not found viable on BOT (Toll) mode, shall be more effective in terms of maximising the quantum of kilometers implemented within the available financial resources of the Government,"" the statement said.The main objective of the approval is to revive highway projects in the country by making one more mode of delivery of highway projects, it said.It said by adopting the model, all major stakeholders in the PPP arrangement - the Authority, lender and the developer, concessionaire would have an increased comfort level resulting in revival of the sector through renewed interest of private developers/investors in highway projects and this will bring relief thereby to citizens/travelers in the area of a respective project,"" the government said.It will facilitate uplifting the socio-economic condition of the entire nation due to increased connectivity across the length and breadth of the country leading to enhanced economic activity, it said.Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has recently said, ""No one (private players) was ready to participate in the PPP-based projects as they had lost faith (in the previous government).

&gt; * ""One of the documents developed by the Planning Commission for infrastructure including highways is the MCA for Annuity Projects -version April, 2014,"" the statement said.The statement said the latest MCA provides an alternative model in the form of Design, Build, Operate and Transfer (DBOT) where the project is financed only to the extent of a certain percentage of the cost by the private investor.This investment is recovered through annuity payments to be made by the government/Authority over a specified period commencing from the date of commissioning of the project, it said, adding that the balance percentage of the project cost is provided by the government during the construction period.Since the need for improved road connectivity is a continuing imperative, the MoRTH including its implementing agencies like the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had to increasingly resort to the public funded engineering, procurement and construction.The government said there is an inherent limitation in implementing projects on EPC mode as such implementation is restricted by the financial resources available with the government.

&gt; * Accordingly, it was decided to consider the Planning Commission MCA for Annuity Projects -version April, 2014,"" it said.This model also provides an increased comfort level for the lenders and concessionaires as traffic and inflation risks are taken by the Authority.An important feature of the Hybrid Annuity Model for highways development is the rational approach adopted for allocation of risks between the PPP partners - the Government and the private partner i.e.

---

&gt; * They were accused of being part of a hit squad of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India and arrested for allegedly planning a series of terror strikes across the nerve centres of Karnataka, including the Kaiga Nuclear plant, the Hubli airport, and offices of major companies like Infosys, Dell, and IBM.The crime was of the highest order and so were the charges  under Sections 120B, 121, 121A, 122, 124A, 153A(1AB), 153B(1A) of the Indian Penal Code; Sections 10, 11, 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

&gt; * The accused were arrested and webbed in several cases after the initial one and were taken to police stations and prisons across the country, consistently delaying trials.In the Hubli conspiracy case, the trial got shelved for almost a year when the Gujarat government refused to let them out of Sabarmati Jail.

&gt; * Sadiq, who was earlier arrested in 2004 by the Gujarat police for alleged SIMI links, was reporting every week to the local police station at the time of arrest.Apart from the above arrests in Karnataka, nine out of the 18 accused in the so-called Hubli conspiracy are those who were arrested in Madhya Pradesh (one absconding accused named in the First Information Report was not named in the charge-sheet).

&gt; * The Hubli conspiracy is part of a webbing of terror cases that extended in an outward spiral from the arrests in Preetampur in Madhya Pradesh.Likewise, the so-called Belgaum conspiracy case was against 11, in which one accused is from 13 people arrested in Madhya Pradesh, and another one from the Hubli conspiracy case, along with three of those who were wrongly arrested for the Hubli court blast, while the rest were new.Two of the primary cases that have constituted this outward spiral have now proved to be false.

&gt;* Foreign invaders thus created a caste of charma-karma (dealing with skin) by giving such works as punishment to proud Hindu prisoners.""

&gt;* Later, new social movements like Bhakti, directly, and Sufi, indirectly, partly reduced the intensity of the caste oppression and untouchability.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister will hold meeting with his council of ministers, (including the ministers of state who are not part of the Cabinet) on the last Wednesday of every month from now on, to assess the impact of the government decisions that are being taken.This is being seen as a new initiative taken by the Prime Minister to address the gaps in implementation of policies, the need for improvement in some sectors and also to resolve inter-ministerial knots that may be affecting the delivery system.

&gt; * According to sources, these meetings are meant to enhance the governance system.In these monthly meetings, a couple of ministries and departments will be the focus.

&gt; * The idea is to review the working of the ministries and hence of the ministers concerned.At the first meeting, ministries related to the agriculture sector were in focus and the respective ministers made their presentations.

&gt; * Therefore, the government is very keen to regain its pro-people image.PM Modi also met with BJP chief Amit Shah and his full team of office bearers recently, where he took feedback from the party on how the government's functioning is being assessed by the people and how much of the Centre's schemes and policies are working on the ground.

&gt; * Then again, even if one were to assume that Modi was there only to address the concerns of Bodos, by not speaking about reconciliation and rehabilitation, he ignored the same Bodos whose votes he had come to solicit.

&gt; * If Modi couldnt speak even for Bodos, little wonder he ignored others in the bargain, Bangladeshi Muslims and Santhals for instance.

&gt; * The ABSU, which spearheaded the Bodoland agitation with the Bodo Peoples Action Committee (BPAC) in the 1980s and 1990s, is a pale shadow of itself, and has ceded considerable political ground to the BPF.

&gt; * Agreed, the Bangladeshi issue is not endemic only to the Bodo areas, but by not talking reconciliation, leave alone rehabilitation of one and all, Modi has ignored what lies central to the Northeast: peace.

&gt; * The ministry has decided to exempt start-ups from inspections related to key labour lawsincluding the Industrial Disputes Act, the Contract Labour Act, the Employees State Insurance Act, the Trade Union Act and the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Actin a bid to dispel fear and encourage young entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses in India.

&gt; * Thus such start-ups, as defined by DIPP (department of industrial policy and promotion), may be allowed to self-certify compliance with the labour laws, labour secretary Shankar Aggarwal said in the letter.

&gt; * As per the labour ministry, start-ups will not be inspected in the first year of their establishment, and in the next two years, they will not be inspected until the central analysis and intelligence unit of the labour ministry verifies a written complaint and advocates any inspection.

&gt;* His failure to get it through parliament despite holding a majority in the lower house has hurt investor sentiment, contributing to outflows that have made the rupee Asias second-worst performing currency in the past three months.

&gt;* In the interview, Gadkari said the measure has the backing of regional parties holding power in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Biharwhich together account for 36% of the nations 1.3 billion people.

&gt;* The Congress is demanding several changes, including capping the overall rate at 18% and scrapping an additional 1% tax designed to compensate manufacturing-heavy states that fear losing revenue once the measure is implemented.

&gt;* In a statement earlier this month, Congress called its proposals meaningful and constructive. It also accused Modi of repeatedly shifting his position on the GST, and urged him to stop hoodwinking, misleading and pulling wool over the eyes of India.

405,"Conservatives in the UK or conservatives in Germany are right of center - but naturally comparing them to Nazis is ridiculous.

However I don't think the RSS or the Sangh is that close to the center at all. In many ways it's more right-wing than most mainstream republicans. And some elements of the Sangh are far far right compared to even Trump.

Swadeshi is anti-globalization and protectionist in practice. I don't think the Sangh really has an economically right-wing streak to it - most parties in India don't really classify well along economic lines at all. You have to be pro-poor in India, end of discussion.

&gt;Of course. Trump is their presidential candidate. Congressmen and senators are known to be crazy in the US as well.

Some of the things the people in Indian parliament have done (not just from the right of course) are wayyyyy worse than America. It's not even a contest. 

Look at it this way : Modi was not found guilty of 2002 right ? But he still became PM. In America if you are governor of a state where 1000+ people died, you will NEVER get to any position of power, your political career would be totally ruined irrespective of how many clean chits you get. There are people that say completely outrageous shit in positions of power in India, far far worse than what republicans say.

The thing is, BJP and the Sangh are far more conservative socially than mainstream republicans. Definitely most are worse than Trump. Don't look at it from the PoV of an Indian, just look at it from a neutral PoV as ""an outsider"". For an Indian Trump would be 100x bad. For example - as a Hindu, I would find majoritarianism to be immediately dangerous personally in India (of course it would hurt others). But that's not really important.

Of course it's not just something that's the BJP's fault - I think India in general is just very traditionalist, conservative and backward. Obviously politics will be in a total shit heap. The value of life in India is extremely low, social inequality is tremendous and the electorate is gullible and uneducated.",2016-01-28 22:10:58

Between 1980 and 1984, did any serious fiasco take place on the part of the Congress central government apart from the handling of Bhindranwale? And did she not put that matter to a *decisive* end?

---

&gt;* The National Investigation Agency is probing whether or not the December 28 blast that ripped through Bengaluru's Church Street area in 2014, has a link to dreaded terror group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

&gt;* The development comes after NIA sleuths were able to crack down on a countrywide network of ISIS sympathisers, eventually arresting 16 suspects.

&gt;* MUMBAI: The quality of foreign direct investment (FDI) coming into the country has improved substantially, according to Reserve Bank of India data.Much of this FDI materialised in the September 2014-November 2015 period after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Make in India campaign and bettered portfolio inflows during the preceding 15 months.Gross FDI inflows amounted to $62.6 billion, 31% higher than $47.6 billion in the preceding 15 months.This is more than triple the amount of net portfolio inflows of $14.3 billion in the same period.

&gt;* ""FDI and portfolio flows over the past year-and-a-half suggest that conscious efforts of the government to encourage more stable direct investments are yielding results,"" said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank.

&gt;* Was the much derided fake letter, purporting to be from Jawaharlal Nehru to British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, describing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal, that was widely circulated on social media recently, sponsored by the Modi government or the Bharatiya Janata Party?

&gt;* Regardless of the actual complicity of the government or the ruling party  or some of its members  in promoting this crude forgery, this much can be said with certainty: BJP propagandists have been at work for quite some time now, photoshopping history to present a highly slanted version of Netaji.

&gt;* It is an incontrovertible historical fact that perhaps influenced by Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, his political mentor, Subhas Chandra Bose, right from the outset, was a vociferous advocate of secularism, going to the extent of drawing a distinction between nationalist Hindus and Muslims in the Congress and those who were communalist.

&gt;* If any more proof is necessary to underline Netajis opposition to the Hindu Right over anything else, it is provided by his approach to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections which Bose contested as head of his newly formed party Forward Bloc, shortly after leaving the Congress in a huff.

&gt;* The generous use of Persian and Urdu instead of Hindi names for Netajis rebel army, its motto, decorations, provisional government and the way Bose ended his fiery speeches with Inquilab Zindabad instead of Jai Hind or Bharati Mata ki Jai were all anathema to the Hindu Mahasabha and its fellow travelers.

&gt; * Total stressed assets (bad and restructured assets) in the banking sector has risen to 12 per cent of the total bank loans, while gross NPAs of the banking sector, as a percentage of total loans, could reach 5.4% by September 2016, according to the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) financial stability report (FSR) from 5.1% in September 2015.

Upon scouring through the comments on that link, I found someone posted these counter arguments:

&gt; Mr. Sandipan could not - rather did not - take into account that this letter was written by a secretary Shyamlal Jain. Now consider these points:
1. Jain was dictated to type on typewriter. He could have made grammatical mistakes in spellings.
2. Jain gave an affidavit sworn by oath before Khosla Commission constituted to probe Bose's death in airplane crash that he wrote the letter. 
3. Jain narrated the contents of his letter by memory, which tally with the contents of the purported letter.
4. There is no motive for Jain to tell a lie.
5. Objections raised by Sandipan are historical wrong. After Hitler attacked Poland etc. Just before attacking USSR Stalin join hands with the Allied Countries. It was much before 1945. Mr. Sharma when did WW2 start? When Hitler attacked USSR?
5. Mr. Sharma must know the original letter - and not its copies - are signed by the author.
6. Draft letters are corrected several times before the final approved one is prepared.
7. The letter in the image shown here is clearly the draft one and not the final approved one.
8. If forged, who forged it. PMO under Modi? Are you suggesting PMO does not have English knowing competent persons?

462,"&gt; Yes, unfiltered.

You are in a minority. Children should not be exposed to things when they don't have enough maturity. 

Do you teach unfiltered science to a child? Do you tell him that newtonian mechanics is outdated and general theory of relativity is used to calculate orbital mechanics? Should you not teach him Bohr's model first before exposing him to quantum mechanics? This is because a child does not have the maturity to handle comple science. It's the same with Humanities.

A child does not have the maturity to deal with all the complexities of history. He does not realise that modern morality had not developed then and it is foolish to think present day Muslims are equivalent to Muslims of medieval age. In fact, right wingers still don't realise it when they compare temple demolitions done at the time of Babar to Babri Masjid demolition. That is exactly the result of teaching hate to young children who don't have the capability to reason. Even in my past comment I mentioned that almost every great personality of yore had a complex personality. Which is why it is not necessary to expose children to Einstein's or Newton's dark sides while teaching them science.

&gt;Funny you bring that up. The textbooks actually DO tell the kids that Shivaji sacked Surat twice and that Chauth was levied by him in places he didn't rule. Without the term ""barbarity"", his acts are narrated in full. While Aurangzeb's aren't. Now do you see a problem?

As I've said, as far as I can remember these were not taught to 6-10th standard students. Most children don't take Arts in plus two. Majority either take science or commerce. And 12th graders are a lot more mature than 6-8th graders. So I don't yet see a problem. Also I clearly remember that our teachers told us that the earlier Mughals were quite liberal while Aurangzeb was a bigot so i don't know what you are talking about.

&gt;Panagaria and Bhagwati's story of hardships under the Marxist cabal, and many other lost intelligent men will testify to the ostracization of right wing intellectuals at the very start of their careers.

Are Bhagwati and Panagariya historians? Then why even bring them to this debate? And I wasn't aware that they were 'ostracised'. If this is true, then I learnt a new thing today. I would appreciate some articles by reputed sources which say so. Thanks.

&gt;For more than 3 decades people who thought outside the Marxist box have been not allowed tenure, not been appointed to committees, not given grants, not given awards, and have systematically been prevented from giving their best. Why do you think ICHR, JNU, NCERT, basically all government controlled institutions have been strongholds of the leftist academia? Do you really think it was a random turn of events?

Let me very clear, when I say I am leftist I don't mean marxist. In India left means marxism; being leftist means that I am liberal/libertarian. If you go through the history of liberal/libertarian politics then you'll see that most of their policies are worth supporting (including pro-abortion, anti-war, feminism, civil rights, liberty and equality, LGBT support) whereas right wingers worldwide are mostly nut jobs (who don't support gay rights, anti-evolution, state sponsored religion, etc). So the reason I am a leftist (liberal) has nothing to do with Modi or BJP (although they too are totally against LGBT rights and support weird theories like genetics in ancient india).

Now I ask you do you think it is a random turn of events that not only in India but worldwide in most universities of fame, it is the left liberals who have strength? Have you ever thought that there must be pretty good reasons that most intellectual people are also left wingers. Also that being left winger does not mean that you are against free markets or capitalism? Being leftist does not mean that a person is socialist or marxist. There are many people who support right wing economics while being socially leftist. 

Also Bhyrappa is a tenured professor so I don't know whether he has been victimised against or not but not surprisingly like most right wingers he has an unsurprisingly low opinion for progressive women (Yaana) and Muslims (Aavarana).

&gt;Why do you think ICHR, JNU, NCERT, basically all government controlled institutions have been strongholds of the leftist academia? Do you really think it was a random turn of events?

Although I have responded but to clarify, the reason is similar to why left wingers control academia throughout the world. The reason is same as why universities across the West are considered bastions of liberalism. The reason is throughout history liberals have brought change and throughout history conservatives have resisted change. Throughout history it is the liberals who succeeded in creating a better world (starting from the suffragettes to the monkey trials and even during European renaissance). Therefore it is not surprising that people with retrograde views and opinions are shunned in every modern university. And considering what NDA is doing to institutions like ICHR (where a person with no proper background other than being a Sangh apologetic was made Head), the day is very soon when you'll soon find that education is being saffronised again. I am thankful that I read NCERT books and not Gujarat state board books but in any case, I doubt whether my children would have the same fate.

How many more countries will they devastate, how many more communities they will obliterate. America could do well with a little dose of socialism and it will help India grow faster too. 

Finally, I'm not a die hard fan of modi at all. I just hate the others way more. If modi turns into a psychopath, I will be the first guy to call for his ouster.",2016-01-29 18:14:57
471,"This is the standard Indian self proclaimed ""die hard capitalist"". He is usually huge fan of socialists and big government because they don't have a clue about right wing politics other than right wing religious/social politics and ""bijness frandly"".  

&gt; Compromises must be made at this level but modi has shown he is very pro business too.    

As Ayn Rand said ""Government help to business is just as disastrous as government persecution. The only way a government can be of service to national prosperity is by keeping its hands off.""   

Both Congress and BJP are pro-business socialists. 

Anyway, as I updated in my original comment, I don't think Sanders stands a chance in the the general even if he somehow manages to win the primaries. And if he loses Iowa, he will probably be out by Super Tuesday.

---

&gt;* RattanIndia Power Ltd. whichhas 1.6 gigawatts of thermal capacity in central India, asked government permission to install solar panels at the site in Punjab instead of the coal plant it was planning, said Rajiv Rattan, chairman of RattanIndia Group.

&gt;* The decision highlights increasing interest in Indias solar program after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set out a target to install 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2020 at an estimated cost of $100 billion.

&gt;* Incentives and regulations designed to draw finance from companies to help meet the target have attracted a handful of overseas developers to bid in auctions for power contracts in India, reducing the cost of solar electricity to a record low.

&gt;* The cost of solar power touched a record low of 4.34 rupees (or 6 cents) a kilowatt-hour for contracts awarded on Jan. 19 in the sunny southern state of Rajasthan, where a total of 420 megawatts of capacity was granted.

&gt;* The Indian company won another 40 megawattsat 4.43 rupees a kilowatt hour on Jan. 23 in Maharashtra, where it has over 200 acres.

---

&gt;* In order to make this idea global, India under the leadership of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has launched International Solar Alliance(ISA) on 30 November, 2015 with the French President, Franois Hollande, at the Paris COP21 climate summit.

&gt;* Modi government quickly realised the importance of having renewable sources of energy and launched ISA with French President, Franois Hollande, at Paris COP21 climate summit.

&gt;* While addressing the packed audience in Paris, Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, India said, Solar had created a revolution, as costs had declined sharply, technology continued to evolve and grid connectivity was improving.

&gt;* In an exclusive interview with techstory.in, Tanya Batra, Vice President- Marketing, Sunkalp Energy, New Delhi and Gyanesh Chaudhary, Managing Director and CEO, Vikram Solar, Kolkata share their views about the newly launch ISA.

&gt;* I feel India would be a testing ground for implementing the objectives highlighted in ISA working paper, and hence would greatly benefit in growing solar in leaps and bounds within the country.

---

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday carried out a bureaucratic reshuffle to bring in new officers to head crucial departments such as agriculture, telecom and information technology and moved out others who were unable to match the governments expectations.

&gt;* A government official suggested the reshuffle, originally necessitated due to some retirements, reflected the governments commitment to closely watch the performance of civil servants too and take corrective steps.

&gt;* Uttar Pradesh cadre IAS officer JS Deepak has been appointed as the telecom secretary and replaced Rakesh Garg who will now head the minority affairs department.

&gt;* Deepak, who earlier was the IT secretary, will still be reporting to Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who holds the charge of both the IT and the telecom departments.

&gt;* Sharma had landed into a controversy, during her previous stint at the Centre as Doordarshans director general, for awarding contracts for broadcasting rights to UK-based SIS Live for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.
