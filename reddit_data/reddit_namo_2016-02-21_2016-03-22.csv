0,"Fuck BJP. 
I am from Haryana and I always supported them in the last 3 years. I had no interest in politics until my brother who's abroad made me realized that this NaMo was the last hope for our nation. My family always voted for congress but i voted for BJP in 2014's central and state election.

Haryana had a Jat chief minister for 20 years before BJP came to power. Both of the previous CMs did a lot for their jat community. Most of the posts in the government jobs were allotted to their jat supporters, relatives etc. In fact one previous C.M Chautala is in jail for these very corrupt prcatices.

Jats also dominate the haryana police which is one reason why these protests spread so much without any police resistance. They also dominate in educational institutes both as faculty and students in many areas.

Now, Jats have a strong brotherhood among them. For them, their caste comes first, no matter what. Jats have a concept of Chaudhar meaning power, hence they are called Chaudhary. When khatter became CM they lost their Chaudhar. They have hated him from day one and wanted revenge in some form. BJP won because most non-jat voted for them and now they are betraying these very people.

Curfew was imposed in the state and also in my town. My family is still there, i can't reach them because jats have blocked all roads. My dad was telling me that jat mobs have burned many shops, banks even the power station and hospitals. Also now they are blaming non-jats for all this mayhem.

If these people get this reservation than this is the biggest slap on the face of Law and Order in this country.",2016-02-21 20:43:31
1,"his cronies have a habit of blowing shit out of proportion

India's Daughter documentary, SRK comments, Aamir Khan comments, JNU shit

All this was tiny, petty shit. No one would have even given two shits about them. JNU does random shit like that all the goddamn time. Celebs make comments all the time. BBC makes documentaries all the time

But NaMo and cronies can't handle that",2016-02-22 15:11:34

4,"Govt is playing victim?

LOL?

5,"Excessive sexual thoughts are usually due to a spiritual root cause. They can be controlled and overcome by chanting and with spiritual healing remedies.

---

&gt; * Even though I could not control the sexual thoughts, I was disgusted by them and also by myself.

&gt; * The reasonbehind the excessive sexual thoughts was a witch.

&gt; * That is why she is putting sexual thoughts in his mind.

&gt; * If the sexual thoughts are caused by negative energies to put obstacles in a seekers path from doing higher levels of spiritual practice, then to rid oneself of sexual thoughts one should chant the Name of Srikrushna, which is Om Namo Bhagavate Vsudevya.

7,"Is it a NaMo app or a PMO app? If its the former, I have reservations about it. If its an app for the PMO which will be passed on to the next PM in office, its totally fine",2016-03-04 18:28:08
8,"I mean seriously, how come r/India has not realized that every single ""student"" you see raising his voice for ""azadi"" is nothing but a intern politician. 

All politicians begin like this. If you see the history of your current politicians ...they ALL begin as students, whether it be ABVP or something else.

So, please next time you hear a ""student"" (or a ""scholar"") being captured by police for some slogans, before you go bat-shit crazy about lack of freedom, imagine a young NaMo getting caught - and then react. It is nothing special. Happens all the time in politics. They go to jail, get publicity, then come out and campaign, and then get a ticket, then become a MLA, then a MP and then CM and then PM.

Not that it is good or bad - it is just politics. THE ONLY way to be a successful politician is to be in the public eye. And more often than not, the only way to get in the public eye is to get caught by the police. 

So, when the next Kanhaiya comes across - please don't consider him as the 3rd coming of Jesus (or the 11th avatar of Vishnu) - Since we all know who the 2nd coming and 10th avatar is. Right?

13,"Do I have any other choice other than approving him ? Nope. So I have to even when I don't want to.

It feels almost similar to the US Presidential Election to me except opposite in ideologies. In US they have Republicans who don't really have a good candidate(sane one) whom they all can universally support despite having a legacy of past. Similarly in India the centre-left (Liberals) were on short of any party or a good candidate to support and vote to power (Fuck RG). While the bandwagon of right wing was on all time high after the two terms of MMS and all the propaganda of right wingers (Thanks to APCO). 

Which led NaMo to power and giving full majority to a single party in 30 years. 

Now what about 2019? Going by the current trends of the indian politics I don't really see a real opposition to BJP/NDA they will again play the same rhetoric with a pinch of Nationalism/Jingoism and gain power for another 5 years easily. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTION. And this is what the right wingers on internet love so much, when ever you say that man this government needs to go, they come over say -- who you gonna vote? HA Rahul Gandhi!! ",2016-03-12 00:41:54
14,"&gt; Why can't he be the PM

Capabilities aside, after Namo and Kejriwal and even Raga, PM ship is a popularity contest. And to win a popularity contest you have to be a diva and you have to bitch about other divas. I don't think RR has the inclination to do either.",2016-03-14 16:30:21
15,"&gt;Boss you need to put in little more effort.

I can try as much as I want but I can never be dumb enough to bend over 360 degrees to justify nonsense that people like you can

&gt;Zee news isn't the main property of zee. Ndtv on the other hand has just news as main business.

How does this prove that Zee News has not benefitted from distorting the truth to defend the current government? 

So Zee TV is a big business? Does this mean there can be no means of them benefitting from government generosity? By that logic, no crony capitalism ever exists because the beneficiaries are only big businesses. 

What were NaMo and his chaddi buddies crying about for the last decade then?
