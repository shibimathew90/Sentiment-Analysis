Check out comments on firstpost and facebook after the incident. It is filled with vile and juvenile hatred for the victims. All the extremist views are emboldened because our Leader doesn't speak shit about it. Is that better than opportunistic politicians looking to score brownie points?

33,"Because Modi ji is a sincere politician and doesn't want to lie. 

Firstly, he honestly doesn't give a fuck about one dead Muslim in a village in UP. He has perused the facts of the ""accident"" (as his union minister put it) and would know that a mob killed the Muslim. A Hindu mob which was assembled by the pundit in a temple. Meaning, the killing had the popular support in the village, and if you read the statements coming from the Hindu right, they haven't outrightly condemned the incident either. That is why the local branch of BJP has lent its support to the killers. And more importantly, last time some Muslims were killed by a mob, Narendra Modi won the CM election for three consecutive times. There is absolutely no political incentive for NaMo to condemn the incident. 

Secondly, there is an India beyond MSM, English press, and reddit. And in that India, many Hindus support the action of the mob. And those Hindus will cast their vote in the upcoming elections. Amit Shah knows that. NaMo knows that.

---

&gt;* An eatery named Namo Restaurant and Mess on the outskirts of Nagpur, which served alcohol, has been closed down by authorities after protests by BJP workers.

&gt;* But the protestors, including Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Samir Meghe and corporator Pragati Patil, were firm and said they would protest again if the outlet is allowed to open after six months.

&gt;* The name of the bar was kept as Namo deliberately to embarrass the chief executive of the country, said Meghe, who insisted that the restaurant should not be allowed to reopen.

&gt;* Political activists said the Namo Restaurant was started a year ago in an unauthorised manner and the local gram panchayat had refused to give it a no-objection certificate (NOC).

&gt;* BJP legislator Samir Meghe, corporator Pragati Patil and Youth Congress leader Kunda Raut joined the protesters, who resolved to continue their campaign till the outlet was closed.
