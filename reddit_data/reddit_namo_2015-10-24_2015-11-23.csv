&gt; * TNA: Days before polling for the crucial third phase in Bihar, the BJP poached Bhim Singh, an important leader of the 'extremely backward castes' (EBCs) from JD(U) while making it clear that it was all set to project PM Narendra Modi as the tallest ""backward leader"".The induction of Bhim Singh midway through the polls is to make an important statement to the coalition of castes which is expected to make the difference between victory and defeat.In the process, the party blinked on Modi's scathing criticism of Bhim Singh, a one-time aide of CM Nitish Kumar and minister in his government, for making light of the killing of a jawan in cross-border shelling by Pakistan in 2013.

&gt; * Besides a signal to EBCs who together account for one-fourth of the electorate, the party also values the move as a refutation of the claim of its 'secular' opponents of a consolidation of 'backwards' against the BJP, a prospect that will mean the electoral annihilation of the party.Significantly, while announcing Bhim Singh's entry, Sushil Modi flaunted Narendra Modi's accomplishment as the first 'EBC' politician to become PM on the strength of his appeal among people.

&gt; * The BJP has several EBC faces -Prem Kumar, Ram Chandra Chandravanshi (Jharkhand minister) and now Bhim Singh,"" Modi said.

&gt; * On PM Narendra Modi's EBC connection, he said, ""EBC and Dalits are solidly behind PM Narendra Modi.

1. As long as Hindus vote per the socio-economic reality of caste, rather than a fabricated unity of religion, India can resist becoming a Hindu Pakistan. 

2. It will be interesting to see the kind of conclusions drawn by Amit Shah. Will that fat fuck think that polarisation doesn't work, or will he think that he didn't polarise enough ?

3. In Delhi, BJP leader made the Ramzade-Haramzade remark, they lost, badly. In Bihar, they put out blatantly communal ads, made religious remarks, and again lost. Though I think BJP would continue to be a party of Yogi Adityanaths, the RSS pedigree is too tough to undo. 

4. In Bihar, we saw a united opposition taking on Sangh and BJP. The results are for everyone to see. Polarization works both ways. You have a united opposition to deal with.

5. Brahmins and allied upper castes live in their own insulated bubbles. Remember when Lalu made a remark on caste and he was booed in a CNN-IBN discussion, and it was reported widely that youth doesn't recognise caste. Lel. 

6. NaMo is very interested in managing PR. As someone who roots for BJP's downfall, I hope the preoccupation continues :) 

7. You can't have the PM of the country conducting 27 rallies in the state, and then say that the election are not a mandate on him. ",2015-11-08 11:22:26
22,"&gt;As long as Hindus vote per the socio-economic reality of caste, rather than a fabricated unity of religion, India can resist becoming a Hindu Pakistan.

Interesting point. Caste politics is better than religious politics for now.

&gt;It will be interesting to see the kind of conclusions drawn by Amit Shah. Will that fat fuck think that polarisation doesn't work, or will he think that he didn't polarise enough ?

Very concerning. I think there were two experiments running simultaneously. Media and intellectuals, who as a fact hate BJP, were creating a situation where people question BJP. BJP was trying to do a tightrope walk at first by allowing a few leaders to make communal statements and when that didn't seem enough they went ahead with cow ad. Looks like Medi+Intellectuals 1- BJP 0.

&gt;Though I think BJP would continue to be a party of Yogi Adityanaths, the RSS pedigree is too tough to undo.

I have the same feeling and after two decades of supporting them I have finally reached a point where I am okay with a Lalu supported Nitish winning even though I know Lalu in any form is harmful.

&gt;You have a united opposition to deal with.

I think this is not a big deal for BJP. Right now all the parties are in denial mode. Give them time they will come around.

&gt;Remember when Lalu made a remark on caste and he was booed in a CNN-IBN discussion, and it was reported widely that youth doesn't recognise caste. Lel.

It is so called intellectuals and journalists sitting in studios of Delhi/Mumbai who believe such things. It can't be emphasized enough but the intellectual/educated/rich/privileged class of India is in complete disconnect with real India. You should hear some of these people talk. They believe the position they are in because of their effort, intelligence and ability and rest of India is dumb. That includes randia.

&gt;NaMo is very interested in managing PR. As someone who roots for BJP's downfall, I hope the preoccupation continues :)

I had high hopes. While I still think he wants to do good he is more obsessed with projecting that he is doing good than doing actual good. Case in point is swachh bharat abhiyan. No infrastructure was created for swachh bharat in spite of all the fan fare. We are yet to see any solid reforms, even discussion.

Pappu wants achche din in just 12 months. Such a Shame Double Standard thinking……

We have elected a prime minister not a
magician. (Must Read)…..

Why is Narendra Modi making more foreign visits ???

1. For the first time after 42 yrs Indian
Prime Minister visited Canada not to attend some meeting but as a specific state visit, in a Bilateral deal, India was able convince to Canada to supply Uranium for India’s Nuclear reactors for next 5 years. It will be of great help to Resolve India’s Power problems. . . .

2. Canada approves visa on arrival for all Indian tourists. . . .

3. Australia is set to sign a Nuclear Power deal with India to supply around 500 tonnes of Uranium to India……

4. Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Indra Nooyi (Pepsico), Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), Jeff
Bezos (Amazon), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) discusses possible investments……

5. Israel inks $5 million deal for Joint Educational Research programme……

6. $20 billion investment from Xi and his Chinese counterparts……

7. 2 Billion Euros support from France for sustainable development in India……

8. Airbus to increase outsourcing in India from 400 million euros to 2 billion euros over the next five years……

9. French National Railways has agreed to co-finance an execution study for a semi- high speed project on upgradation of the Delhi-Chandigarh line to 200 kmph…….

10. Canada agrees to supply 3,000 metric tonnes of uranium to India from this year to power Indian atomic reactors…….

11. Japan and India agree to jointly produce mixed rare earth.

And While we are all yearning for a transformation, development, etc. There is
someone who is actually setting up the
infrastructure for it……

Marketing of ‘Brand India’ has never been so
important……

Number of days Modi stayed abroad touring
15 countries as a PM on official trips = 45……

Number of days Rahul stayed abroad (Bangkok) without informing his voters = 57…….

Now read the description below:
1. BJP Govt. convinced Saudi Arabia not to charge “On-Time Delivery 1 Premium charges” on Crude Oil – Young Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan &amp; External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj sealed the deal. Saved the country thousands of crores… . .

2. India will build 4 Hydroelectric power stations + Dams in Bhutan (India will get lion’s share in Green energy that will be produced in future from these projects) . .

3. India will build Biggest ever dam of Nepal (China was trying hard to get that) – India will get 83% Green energy produce from that hydro power station for free – in future. . . . .

4. Increased relationship with Japan and they agreed to invest $ 30 Billion in DMIC (Delhi – Mumbai Investment Corridor)..

5. Increased strategic relationship with Vietnam and Vietnam has now agreed to give contract of Oil exploration to ONGC-Videsh (UPA was not ready to take this at all because they were worried about China – and getting into a conflict of interests on south China sea)

6. Increase Oil Imports from Iran, despite the ban by USA. . Iran agreed to sell in Indian Rupees and it saved our Forex, not just for now, but protected India from future currency fluctuations. India also gets to build “Chabahar” port of Iran, encircling Pakistan. Because we well have exclusive access for our Naval ships in this port.

7. Australia- despite Australia being a major supplier of Coal &amp; Uranium. . . NaMo was able to convince Tony Abbott and now Australia will supply Uranium for our energy production. . .

8. China leaning President Rajapakse lost elections in Sri Lanka – Remember UPA lost “Hambantota” port development – read latest report of CIA, where they mention RAW has played a major role in power shift of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has backed out of Chinese contract and shifted to Indian project managers.

9. With China, as Trade Deficit was increasing, NaMo forced their hand. Anti-Dumping will come soon so China will invest heavily into India. – China has already committed $ 20 billion Investment in India. That’s nearly ₹140,000 crores.

10. On Security – I think adding Ajit Doval to his team is the best decision by NaMo. See the recent tie-up with Pentagon, Israel &amp; Japan. . Now see how we stopped the Terror Boat and listen to his words … “Any Mumbai like attack from Pakistan and Pakistan will lose Baluchistan!” That’s the language of deterrence that I want to hear as an Indian. We won’t hit first, but if you do, we surely won’t turn the other cheek…. . . .

11. India approved the border road in the NorthEast and around India- China border – Remember just because of China’s opposition, the ADB (Asian Development Bank) didn’t give us funds during UPA regime and UPA held that file under “Environment Ministry control – Remember the infamous “JAYANTHI TAX “? No one bothered about the disastrous effect on our armed forces.

12. India managed to bring back 4,500+ Indians from War zone in Yemen and also brought foreign nationals of 41 different countries, which put India’s name onto the highest platform globally in conducting that rescue mission – PM Narendra Modi specially talked to the new Saudi Arabian king Salman and told him to allow Indian Airforce planes to fly – as Saudi Arabia was attacking on Yemen and Yemen skies was declared NO-FLY Zone: thanks to this we got an assured clear window of a few hours and guys guess who coordinated this? Ajit Doval, Sushama Swaraj and Gen V K Singh. All in person…. When was the
last time you ever heard of ministers involved personally in such efforts that didn’t fetch thousands of crores?? Guess the religion of those rescued?? But it isn’t secular.

13. India’s Air defense was getting weaker by the day, UPA was very happy to let it happen despite repeated specific inputs from the armed forces, NaMo renegotiated Rafale fighter Jets deal with France personally and bought 36 Jets on ASAP basis. At better than rack rates. No middlemen, no commissions…

14. $35 billion investment by Japan over a period of 5 years and along with it their expertise in making bullet trains……

15. Till recently we were exclusively buying Nuclear Reactors from Russia or USA and it was much like beggar kind of situation because they were worried about usage of Nuclear reactor for some other use. So only what they opted to give us, we could get. . Now Narendra Modi was able to convince France and now France will make Nuclear reactors with the latest technology in India. On MAKE IN INDIA efforts.. with collaboration with an Indian company as a partner. . .

16. During 26th Jan. visit of Barack Obama , NaMo convinced USA to drop rule of Nuclear fuel tracking and sorted out Liabilities rules which now open the gates for next

We had leaders like Nehru, we built temples of modern India, we made 5 year plans, we had a few noble lauerates to boast of and a certain section also had good british education. India still has the largest english speaking population. Did we fall behind others because we were less educated? Absolutely not!!

According to the professor who took the class, India probably paid the price of having too much education with elites having their grand schemes and plans trying out experiments and implementing naive and idealistic visions. 

No Keynes or Friedman, just give people space to work, promote their entrepreneurial spirit, do not complicate things a lot and stop with bullshit, people will take care of the rest. Ofcourse they will get educated with time, but they will need to start at the bottom and rise up. 

Even the meaning of education these days is different, I guess vocational education is much more important compared to the usual history and geography. Skill India don't kill India Om Namo Namo :P .

52,"&gt;She just restricts herself to the yoga postures

She doesn’t. She teaches *Kundalini yoga* classes, which consist of much more than just yoga postures. There are many disciplines of yoga that are just about yoga postures, but Kundalini yoga is not one of those – Kundalini yoga teachers learn in their teacher training program not to deviate from the teachings and to not pick and choose just parts of the teachings. There is a very specific structure to each class. Chanting mantar (some in Sanskrit, others in Gurmukhi) is an integral part of a Kundalini yoga class, it cannot be skipped.

I’ve attended Kundalini yoga classes at over 50 yoga centers in the US, Europe, and Asia. I’m a 2nd generation Kundalini yoga teacher (my mataji is the head of the teacher training program in my home country), I’ve worked for IKYTA in the USA, the International Kundalini Yoga Teachers Association, and until recently I worked at a private secondary school in Amritsar where students from 40 different countries learn to become Kundalini yoga teachers.

I’ll give you an idea of what a Kundalini yoga class consists of.

To tune in, the following two mantar are chanted:

&gt;Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo

&gt;Aad Gureh Nameh, Jugaad Gureh Nameh, Sat Gureh Nameh, Siri Guru Day Vay Nameh

This is followed by one of more kriya (sets of yoga postures).

Afterwards, there will be a meditation, in which more mantar are chanted or silently meditated on. Common ones are:

* Guru Guru Wahe Guru, Guru Ram Das Guru
* Ek Ong Kar, Sat Gur Prasad, Sat Gur Prasad, Ek Ong Kar
* Hari Nam, Sat Nam, Hari Nam, Hari
* Sat Narayan, Wahe Guru, Hari Narayan, Sat Nam
* Gobinde, Mukande, Udare, Apare, Haring, Karing, Nirname, Akame
* Ra Ma Da Sa Sa Say So Hung

Then there will be a relaxation of 10 minutes, during which everyone lies down and listens to a recording of a mantar being chanted.

The class is closed by chanting the following mantar:
