1,"&gt; [Female circumcision anger aired in India](http://www.dawn.com/news/712748/female-circumcision-anger-aired-in-india-fm)

&gt; The mutilation occurred not in Africa, where the practice is most prevalent, but in India where a small Muslim sub-sect known as the Dawoodi Bohra continues to believe that the removal of the clitoris is the will of God.

&gt; “Female circumcision is clearly a violation of human rights, the Indian government refuses to recognise it as a crime because the practice has full-fledged religious backing,” he said.

&gt; “No government has the courage to touch a religious issue in India even if the practice is a crime against humanity.”

Lets see NAMO take a stand on this since he is so close to the community!

2,Oh yeah I forgot to add: Your Thai king once banged an Indian male prostitute while singing vande mataram at the top of his voice and waving a national flag while watching NaMo live at Madison Garden.,2014-09-30 08:12:22

4,"No matter how much you guys masturbate to NaMo remember

1) He is all for business. Even if it means prices go up and forest are destroyed. No wonder greenpeace is now being banned

2) Expect the right wing to intensify their collective shoving of their pre-dated ideas up our asses.",2014-10-01 11:00:19

10,"I would take Siddarth's argument seriously if he weren't such a hypocrite.

If oil prices had gone up, he'd be the first person blaming NaMo saying he's not done anything yet, ache din kahan hain, etc. 

Secular logic:

When good things happen = luck / anything but Modi. 

When bad things happen = Modi incompetence. ",2014-10-05 01:26:27
11,I read that Namo tweet before this and interpreted as following: Since we form the gov. we have reduced the petrol and diesel prices. They could have kept the same and let the companies profit but decided to lower the price.,2014-10-05 01:40:11
12,"Modi is a good pm,  but saying he is the best we can do is a understatement..  I do agree we have not been able to produce good cm, mayor who can take his place but remember we have changed a lot in 10 years..  

10 years ago no one would care for a bill or a girl or anything what so ever..  This gen will give new cm and mayor who may ( touch wood) be better or as good as namo",2014-10-06 13:10:09
13,"To extend your logic - Why would either side violate ceasefire and invite a reaction from the other side?

**Reasons Pakistan started it**

* Give cover fire to help sneak infiltrators across the LoC
* Test new govt's patience to prove that NaMo is either a wuss and cannot do anything to stop Pakis from killing Kashmiris or provoke him into escalating the response in order to demonstrate how Kashmir is disputed territory
* Disrupt law and order in J&amp;K to terrorize EC and delay/disrupt assembly elections
* Unite bickering Pakistani factions by giving them a reason to hate India
* Just for lulz

**Reasons India started it**

* Give Indians a reason to hate Pakistan (like we need any more. this would also invite ire from local jammu residents for using them as guinea pigs when BJP is trying to *pataao* them in coming elections)
* Arnab bribed BSF cuz he wants to bash Pakis on noisehour 
* Just for lulz 

Now which of these reasons sound logical?",2014-10-07 14:06:11
14,"Saar, where do I sign up ? I mean who wouldn't want to be in the clear when a massive alien force intervenes.

Also the stated purpose is to ""Defeat the armies of our enemies"". Namo army wale toh gaye saare.

But ? Why exactly are we inviting the aliens in the first page. Do they respond only to a Rajasurya yaga ? I mean, what if the aliens are from a  planet outside the solar system , won't they be pissed at calling the yaga by the name of a lesser star ? Don't want to risk aggravating the new alien overlords.

20,"But I've seen marriages after a bollywood style ""love"" become very successful. I've seen girls from decent households ""runaway"" and marry auto drivers and roadside vendors in typical movie style with friends from both sides pitching in to to help the love lorn couple. It was all a sense ""aww cute couple"" and ""true love wins blah blah"", and it always turns better than I initially think, and ends in happily ever after. With the girl being the one who inspires other girls/women in her social circle after the successful marriage for showing that women are independent and smart enough to make decisions for themselves. I don't know all the details of this particular case, but in general, I agree with other commentators on this thread that this might have been a close shave for the girl and the guy. It is very likely that they both might have been killed for this. Namo Namah!",2014-10-16 02:00:35
21,"I agree with every point of this. Raj Thakre disappointed his followers badly. he mostly followed by age group of 18 to 40 (we call them young voter). but now young voters have new face to follow NaMo who is more open, out spoken, well connected, keeps his promises, innovative.

22,"Also, do consider he was fighting the LS in the same space as BJP-SS with the exact target group as opposition. Because of NaMo, he couldn't repeat the performance.

This time the situation was pretty much the same, except even NCP was acting as an opposition against congress this time.",2014-10-20 14:10:51

26,"&gt; Party cannot force Jaitely...

Yeah...NO ! 

The same party took two of the biggest figures of BJP- *M.M Joshi / LK Advani*, then rendered them pretty much useless.

Yet you want to believe that they cannot ""force"" Jaitely to take a decision !!

If NaMo/BJP **really** wants to out all the black money holders, it will happen.

28,"&gt; What I don't get is why NRIs watch such crap in droves.

Being NRI doesn't change your taste in movies.

Most NRIs I have know tend to insulate themselves. They are here just to make money by buying Subway franchises and send their kids to murican universities. They still watch desi channels in movie and argue about NaMo rather than worrying about whom to vote in local elections.

I recently went to see the musical ""The Book of Mormons"" and I was the only brown guy amongst a 1000+ white audience.",2014-10-24 20:20:04
29,"&gt; I don’t believe in having extravagant weddings. I have told my kids to keep it as simple as possible. It will be a small family affair.

Yes, a small family affair with NaMo.",2014-10-25 07:09:09

99.99% true. They rarely mingle. 

Case in point - self, others. I try to mingle with locals here.. but it is a bit difficult.
