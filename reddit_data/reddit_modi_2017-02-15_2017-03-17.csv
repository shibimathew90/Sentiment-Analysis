1,"neighbourhood criteria: Learning on job, AAP govt shakes up system

---

&gt;* This was perhaps the biggest setback for the government in a sector that has seen some successes and left a lot to be accomplished.In its two years , the government earmarked a big budgetary allocation for education , was receptive to innovative ideas and made an earnest effort to shake up the government-school system.

&gt;* Its ""Chunauti Mission"", launched on Teachers' Day in 2016, was an acknowledgement that 3.5 lakh youngsters in Classes VI-VIII were unable to read their textbooks.

&gt;* Most others still use old teaching techniques, but kids learn and retain faster when they identify an alphabet with its sound.

&gt;* ""There was incredulity around Chunauti Mission's gain, with the Government School Teachers' Association itself claiming that the original number of 'non-readers' had been inflated to ensure a tangible result later.

&gt;* Both students, parents and teachers are pleased with the way their ""model"" schools are transforming because of the infrastructural and curricular changes.

---

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Left-ruled Kerala accounts for maximum number of RSS shakhas, over 5,000 per day among all its 'prants'(regions), and the number is rising, a Sangh office bearer claimed.Even Gujarat, the state which is seen as a stronghold of both Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and BJP, has only around 1,000 shakhas, which are the daily morning meetings of its members.

&gt; * ""The Left is losing its ground in Kerala as more and more people are joining RSS.

&gt; * ""In the last few years, there has been a rise in the number of Shakhas in the state and this is also one of the major reasons that our workers are being attacked there...,"" RSS's Akhil Bharatiya Saha Prachar Pramukh Nanda Kumar told PTI.Kerala now accounts for the highest number of RSS shakhas, more than 5,000 per day, he said.For its operational convenience, RSS divides Uttar Pradesh into six prants with combined 8,000 shakhas per day, and Maharashtra into four prants with combined around 4,000 shakhas per day.Claiming that the rise in the number of RSS's shakhas started in 2010-11, long before Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister , Kumar said this is a result of the organisation's plans to expand its presence and connect with the youth.The organisation is aiming to almost double its shakhas across the country to about one lakh.

&gt; * Also, in a bid to give itself a modern look, RSS recently replaced its iconic Khaki half pants with trousers.

&gt;* The civic polls will see a tough fight between BJP MLA Raj Purohits son Aakash Purohit, and former BJP senior leader and corporator Janak Sanghvi, who defected to Congress after he was asked to make way for Aakash in ward 221.

&gt;* He said people were angry with the BJPs demonetisation move and the dynastic policy that PM Modi has been attacking all throught his tenure.

&gt;* Raj Purohit has been insisting his sons nomination shouldnt be seen as a case of dynastic politics as he had worked with the BJPs youth wing, which is what got him the ticket.

&gt;* In 2012, a similar controversy had erupted after, Aakash was nominated as a BEST committee member, surpassing two veteran former BJP corporators.

&gt;* Singhvi is also trying to take advantage of the Gujarati versus Marwari undercurrent in the ward and is banking on the effect of demonetisation on the trading community.

&gt; * This is the highest number of satellites ever launched in a single mission.The space agency's trusted workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV-C37 , on its 39th mission, took off in the morning, at 9.28 am, today, from Sriharikota space centre with the 104 satellites, of which 101 belongs to international customers.The first to be let off was India's high resolution Cartosat-2 series satellite made especially to monitor activities of India's hostile neighbours at a resolution of less than a metre keeping a bird's eye view on both Pakistan and China.As the scientists at the Mission Control centre broke into cheers, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman A S Kiran Kumar announced: ""All 104 satellites successfully placed in orbit.

&gt; * Compared to successful launch by the Russian Space Agency launching 37 satellites in one go, India became the first country to script history by launching 104 satellites in a single rocket.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee congratulated Team ISRO for the successful launch.It was a significant achievement for ISRO as last time it had launched 23 satellites in one go in June 2015.

&gt; * PSLV first launched the 714 kg CARTOSAT-2 Series satellite for earth observation, followed by 103 co-passenger satellites, together weighing about 664 kg at lift-off into polar Sun Synchronous Orbit, about 520 km from Earth.ISRO scientists have used the XL Variant -- the most powerful rocket -- earlier used in the ambitious Chandrayaan and during the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM).Of 101 co-passenger satellites, 96 belong to USA, five from International customers of ISRO -- Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, respectively.Two other Indian nano satellites, totally weighing about 1,378 kg, will also ride piggyback in the rocketThe nano-satellites belonging to international customers are being launched as part of the arrangement by Antrix Corporation Ltd (ANTRIX) the commercial arm of the ISRO.Cartosat-2 Series, which is the primary satellite, will be similar to the earlier four satellites in Cartosat-2 Series.After coming into operation, it will provide remote sensing services.Images sent by it will be useful for coastal land use and regulation, road network monitoring, distribution of water and creation of land use maps, among others.Cartosat-2 Series has a mission life of five years.The two Indian Nano-satellites INS-1A and INS-1B were developed as co-passenger satellites to accompany bigger satellites on PSLV.The primary objective of INS (ISRO Nano Satellite) is to provide an opportunity for ISRO technology demonstration payloads, provide a standard bus for launch on demand services.INS-1A carries Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function Radiometer and INS-1B caries Earth Exosphere Lyman Alpha Analyser as payloads.

Issues (or electoral drama): there has been a huge anti incumbency against the sitting MLA Sarita Arya (INC) but with BJP giving a ticket to sanjeev arya (son of recently defected congressmen yashpal arya) the contest had become a photo finish as sanjeev arya is a total outsider to the city. While the congress candidate is well known personally to a large section of the electorate. Adding to the drama was independent Hem Arya (formerly of bjp) who is pretty well known as a capable leader in the area. 

All in all it seems that bjp might have won the seat primarily due to three factors 

 1 Money power : yashpal arya is rich af and well if the grapevine is to believed he threw a lot of money. Plus there was a 10k strong rally on 14th in a town of 40k so you imagine the scale. 

 2 Anti incumbency against the sitting MLA

While we are at it, we should also ban and imprison editors of Hindustan Times, ToI, etc. because they also mobilise certain segments of society towards a legal political party.

&gt;* Nepal (125), Sri Lanka (112), Pakistan (141), Bhutan (107), and Bangladesh (128) surpassed India in economic freedom.

&gt;* It said Modi, who in June 2016 made his fourth visit to the US in two years, has bolstered bilateral ties, particularly in defence cooperation.

&gt;* Extreme wealth and poverty coexist as the nation both modernises rapidly and struggles to find paths to inclusive development for its large and diverse population, it said.

&gt;* India is a significant force in world trade, the report noted, but corruption, underdeveloped infrastructure, and poor management of public finance undermine overall development.

---

&gt; * While Sanskrit is a marker of Hindu nationalism for the BJP, it might be surprised, even shocked, to know that the first people to leave behind evidence of having spoken Sanskrit aren't Hindus or Indians  they were Syrians.The earliest form of Sanskrit is that used in the Rig Veda (called Old Indic or Rigvedic Sanskrit).

&gt; * Amazingly, Rigvedic Sanskrit was first recorded in inscriptions found not on the plains of India but in in what is now northern Syria.Between 1500 and 1350 BC, a dynasty called the Mitanni ruled over the upper Euphrates-Tigris basin, land that corresponds to what are now the countries of Syria, Iraq, and Turkey.

&gt; * Moreover, the Mitanni military aristocracy was composed of chariot warriors called maryanna, from the Sanskrit word ""marya"", meaning young man.The Mitanni worshipped the same gods as those in the Rig Veda (but also had their own local ones).

&gt; * If Sanskrit, the liturgical language of Hinduism, has a history that predates its arrival in India, that really does pull the rug from out under the feet of Hindutva.Ironically, twin country Pakistans national myths go in the exact opposite direction: their of-kilter Islamists attempt to make foreign Arabs into founding fathers and completely deny their subcontinental roots.Both national myths, whether Arab or Sanskrit, attempt to imagine a pure, pristine origin culture uncontaminated by unsavoury influences.

&gt;* Read this with the fact that taking government consumption out of GDP figures brings down growth rate for the rest of the economy to only 5.2% for 2016-17, as was pointed out in this article published in Mint .

---

&gt;* India is reviving a three-decade-old plan to build its first passenger aircraft as the South Asian country struggles to join an exclusive club of Asian nations that have advanced far ahead in creating their own home-made jets.A 14-seat aircraft, called Saras, is undergoing preliminary tests, Jitendra Jadhav, director of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research at state-controlled National Aerospace Laboratories, said in an interview in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

&gt;* The development of the twin-turboprop plane suffered a setback in 2009 when a test flight ended in a fiery crash, killing all three crew on board.India may need a few hundred small planes that can carry less than 30 people over the next five to seven years for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to succeed in his plan to boost air links in remote areas of the country, according to Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation.

&gt;* India's air force, which has committed to purchasing 15 of the Saras planes, needs to test the aircraft before certifications and sale to commercial airlines, Jadhav said.The process of getting full certification could take as long as three years, he said.Delays in production of new aircraft is common across the world, even with established companies like Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. announced a fifth delay last month in delivering Japan's first locally made passenger jet to its launch customer, while China's Advanced Regional Jet ARJ21 took 13 years to design, build and bring to market.India's Saras program was conceived about 29 years ago.A separate plan to build a bigger, 50-70 seat commercial aircraft is stuck pending government funding, Jadhav said.

&gt;* Feasibility study for the project, which would need a private party to manufacture, has been done and the proposal has been with the government since 2013, Jadhav said.

&gt;* ""The government should sanction funds, only then we can do it,"" Jadhav said.

81,"Don't care two shits about RaGa. He isn't running the country and if he was, he'd be smart enough to know his limitations, unlike Modi. Also, he'd be in a coalition whereas Modi is a strongman. 

A monumental decision like demonetisation should not be taken without wide-ranging consultations, nor should the RBI be railroaded the way it was. IMHO, it could only have happened the way it did because nobody in Modi's vicinity has the balls to stand up to him and say, sir, with all due respect, but you're wrong.

Bhakts even defend his shenanigans by sperging, ""DUH, A POLITICIAN MADE MORE PROMISES THAN HE CAN DELIVER. THE SUN RISES IN THE EAST"" or ""WOW, THE LEADER OF THE FUCKING COUNTRY SAID HE WAS LIKE GOD, THAT'S TOTALLY BREAKING NEWS"". Well, then why was there a need to remove the previous establishment, if he's going to be doing the same shit? Heck, why even a revolution against the Brits?

84,"Nor only in his vicinity, but this trend follows in the general public, too. Millions of people were badly hit by demonetisation, we were told ""kala dhan ayega... Hum kala dhan nikalenge"". What we got was unexpected tours to bank, standing in queues for hours, lack of currency, etcetera. And the worst of all this was ""bilkul sahi kiye hai Modi ji"" - chanted by the so called educated, informed members of the society. 

Most of these bhakts had no notion of the effects of demonetisation. They all knew the same song, which they recited over and over, everywhere. When asked about the benefits of banning these notes, they would say ""future me pata chal jayega. Dekhna tum, ab tarakki hogi"" 

I remember standing in the queue of my local bank. The environment was hostile. The aggression which common man showed was something you don't want to witness. Most of the people were ready to harm anyone. 

These were those people who had earned their money the hard way, the 9-5 way. Saving a little over years, they had wanted to ensure their future endeavours, their childs fees, savings for the rainy day. 

Not one industrialist or businessman was to be seen in those long lines. Why? Because they had back channels. They knew the managers, 70-30 sharing was done, and they were free to go. No worries.

The tone of your previous comment is at loggerheads with what you're trying to say in the next. By using aggressive language, in a passive-aggressive voice, you're lampooning a ""typical Modi hater"" by saying they don't care about development or corruption but only about a narrative. I'm pointing out how that itself is a narrative. 

The down votes aren't all just from paid shills, as your victim complex forces you to think. People like me disagree fundamentally with the argument that ""I don't care how narcissistic or egomaniacal he is, he's doing progress"". First of all, I don't want leaders that are magalomaniacs. Secondly, I don't see how he's different from the other politicians that he was supposed to be different from. Last but not the least, as a Gujju, I'm well aware of his overwhelming PR machinery drumming up deeblubmund, while reality is different. Many a times a month, for almost a decade and half, did we hear the victory cries of ""100 CRORE MoU"" signed, but never a follow through of those projects, and eventually years later we learn either the projects were scrapped, or only a fraction of the money came through, or his cronies got all of it.

&gt;* The business of putting commercial satellites into space for a fee is growing as phone, Internet and other companies, as well as countries, seek greater and more high-tech communications.

&gt;* Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has often hailed India's budget space technology, quipping in 2014 that a rocket that launched four foreign satellites into orbit had cost less to make than Hollywood film 'Gravity'.

101,"Demonetisation exposed the BJP as a hollow party where there is no internal dissent or free-thinking. It's a party entirely made-up of sycophants who slavishly defend every diktat of the Dear Leader.

Worse, not a single word was raised to defend the autonomy of the RBI as its independence was being railroaded. 

As bad as the economic fallout of DeMo has been, what is far more terrifying is just how ominpotent Modi has become - and frankly, has *allowed* to become, by senior BJP leaders. 


Sadanand Dhume, who himself is an independent-minded center-right journalist(a rare breed these days), put it brilliantly when he wrote:

&gt; There is little evidence the government has the appetite or imagination to successfully address jobless growth, weak public-sector banks, large loss-making state-owned firms, and rigid land and labor markets that lower Indian competitiveness relative to its East Asian peers.

&gt; Along with a soak-the-rich approach to taxation, black-money hysteria will likely slow job creation by prolonging a sense of uncertainty among Indian investors. For the first time in years, tax raids on allegedly crooked businessmen and officials have returned to newspaper front pages. **This suggests that Mr. Modi plans to fight the 2019 national elections not as a job creator but as a moral crusader.**

The whole [column is worth reading in full](https://www.aei.org/publication/a-modest-indian-budget-to-modify-expectations/). 

The BJP and Modi has ditched every last pretense of significant reforms. Reading the 2014 stories in retrospect is now equally hilarious as it is pathetic. Remember how they railed against NREGA? The 2017-18 budget has record allocations to NREGA. They are, in Arun Shourie's words, ""Congress plus Cow"". Nothing else.

It turns out that the closest thing India ever got to a true center-right government was Vajpayee and his government. Modi has given up on job creation and has now embraced Indira Gandhi's populism, where demonisation of those of different classes is now in vogue. Unlike Indira, he will mix Hindutva into this cocktail. I expect him to win in 2019, not as a reformer, but as a demagogue because this is the path he has chosen and this is the path he will complete.",2017-02-17 11:30:32

&gt; ""There was only 4 per cent of cash to replace on the day of announcement of demonetisation. It violates the solemn oath printed on the note that promises to pay the bearers by denying people withdraw own money. It is one disaster after another, started shifting from one goal post to another. First one want to attack black money then you realise that black money turning white in banks, then start talk about counterfeiting. Ironically, terrorists are caught with new currency in their hands.""

&gt; Criticising the new tune of the government on 'cashless economy' he said: ""May be good objective but our digital infrastructure needs revamp. Half of India is unbanked, many people have no access to electricity and internet. There are no POS readers everywhere in country. How can we go cashless when we are not prepared for it?. It is like taking out 86 per cent of blood supply from individual's body, ask him/her not only to walk but also do Bharatanatyam. That's what cashless economy is.

125,"Not sure. I'm guessing there are multiple reasons because it's a complex issue, and even the anti-modi people come from a full spectrum (just like the pro-modi ones and the neutrals).

Some reasons which may be factors:

* The media in our nation loves to polarize issues. A lot of it is almost entirely anti-modi and anti-BJP due to the people who own/run said networks.

* There is a new culture (starting in the west and ending up in India) where it's now fashionable to get offended on behalf of certain segments of society, while casually vilifying and demonizing others, being ultra-politically-correct, feigning taking offense to views and words that are not strictly within those boundaries, while completely shutting down any real conversation - known as the Regressive Left. In the west, secular debate isn't like this. It's more of a racial issue there. But in India, this has been taken up by the self-anointed protectors of 'liberalism' and 'secularism', concepts which mean *totally* different things in India.

* The overall self-loathing of some people, driven by perceived inferiority in the global context.

* The culture of censorship that has developed in some of our top colleges, where liberalism=good and conservatism=doubleplusbad... except, of course, when certain segments of society engage in it. A lot of the general thought and philosophy of the country is shaped by people who went to these institutions, and that has in turn influenced the fairly young demographic of randians. Colleges are supposed to expose you to different views and challenge your biases, not shepherd you into a single file and eliminate all nuance from your thought-process.

* In contrast, the administrations of many colleges in India are backward, regressive, kulcha-warriors, engaging in moral-policing and other stupid crap. That contrast probably drives the youth to be more vociferous against 'the system'. You come up against this type in a few more positions of authority too: society uncles, cops, bosses, etc. which then gets offset onto a political party perceived to represent them (whether it actually does or not is up for debate).

* The same feigned outrage and angst on behalf of people (many fictional, some real) is given a voice here. 

* The new, and infuriating culture of whatsapp-forwards, by 'unkils', spreading more nonsense and further alienating the youth has probably evoked a lot of this vitriol as well.

* Obviously, there are some legitimate grievances which would cause a select few to lash out and hate the government too. And some of it may be due to misinformation and ignorance as well.

* Confirmation bias. Seeing trends when you look for them. Seeing patterns where there are none. Connecting dots that are part-misinformation, part-fact, part-conjecture, part-hyperbole, part-falsehood. Similar trends could probably be seen for any party/government, but by not seeking them, they suddenly cease to exist in the public consciousness.

* The rise of paid shills. This one is a virtual certainty for at least a small group on both sides. Perhaps the anti-modi camps are focusing more on reddit and facebook while the pro-modi camps are focusing on twitter, and whatsapp? I don't know. That's just conjecture, but a plausible line of thought to explain the disproportionate loathing here.

* Happy/content/neutral people have less motivation to post than the dissatisfied/upset/angry people. The same reason bad things seem to stick in your memory while good things fade away. The people most unhappy with the current government will probably be the loudest. The rest have less reason to engage them and bother with proving them wrong, or being involved beyond voting. 

* Good things aren't news-worthy. Bad news rises to the top. What elicits the most outrage and controversy will make the cut. The things that the government does that are positive, and work as intended, will never be heard of, outside of small circles. This affects how people view the government (any government). If the previous one didn't do anything positive but also managed to keep out of the news for the bad stuff, then they'd have a far more positive image than a government which did a lot more net good, because it found itself getting a whole lot more bad press for less significant (but more newsworthy) controversies.

The point is, it's easy to spot a confirmation bias when there is literally not a single thing that a party can do, to earn even the remotest ounce of credit-where-it-is-due from some people. And r/india is literally brimming over with the voices of those people. I don't want to name names, but it's pretty obvious.",2017-02-17 19:18:41
126,"I thought your post is inspired by Gurdaas Maan's new song in which a young Bhagat Singh time travels to see how Punjab today is, and is giving a second thought on sacrificing his life. 

Despite all the flaws, I feel we have done a bloody good job. When we talk about pluralistic societies, which are heterogeneous and yet democracy has flourished, it is only India. Apart from the western world, it is only India that is a major, liberal and strong democracy. Even though we are far from being a true democracy, in some ways we are an oligarchy, an illiberal democracy, a broken system and there is a huge politico-business empire, yet we are still moving in the right direction, and things are only improving. Despite there being calls for a Nagalim or the separatists in Kashmir, we are still one country, and have thankfully not homogenized into one Hindi, Hindu identity.

I agree with you wholeheartedly, that it has become fashionable to shit on our early leaders, especially Nehru. All of them made mistakes, but they were bound to happen for a new country. Nehru was the PM for 17 years! We wish Kashmir had been solved, we wish Article 356 would not have been turned into an instrument for declaring President's rule, but every country has its share of blunders. 

It's grossly unfair to create a narrative that nothing has happened in the past 70 years. At Independence, our literacy rate was 17 per cent! We have a lot of shortcomings still, but we also had a long journey to make. 

As our demography turns younger, I believe things will change for the better. Politics aside, Punjab saw people moving towards Arvind Kejriwal, a Hindu Haryanvi Baniya, only because they saw a brighter future. I am not saying he'll deliver, or that he is a messiah, but the fact that the electorate is moving beyond identity politics is heartening.

Ideally, I'd like the narrative today to have a greater focus towards healthcare and education. Even Modi is faced with this. Despite sustaining a similar growth rate as UPA, he is not able to deliver jobs. The electorate won't go by the growth figures, they ask why their kids are still unemployed. Apart from trying to spur labour intensive MSMEs, Modi can't do much with a broken public education system where high school kids can't count till 100. There is a limit to how many unskilled construction jobs that can be created. A well-educated, healthy population, even in the absence of industrial growth, can at least migrate abroad, or become job-creators.


Amidst all the pessimism that r/India has, I am always reminded of the line Siddharth says in Rang De Basanti, *Koi bhi nation perfect nahi hota, usse perfect banana padta hai* (No nation is perfect, it has to be made perfect). ",2017-02-17 19:20:23

&gt; * Over the last three-four years, the Aeronautical Development Agency has been made awareby several foreign airframers, including stealth pioneer Lockheed-Martin, Dassault, Boeing, BAE Systems,and even MiG Corp that theyd be willing to assist the Ghatak programme in a possible variety of ways  either as offsets, or a commercial consultancy arrangement.

&gt; * Livefist can however confirm that the Narendra Modi government has decided that the stealth component of the Ghatak programme will be entirely in-house, and will be limited to academic institutions and private industry in country.

&gt; * Scientists on the AURA/Ghatak programme confirm to Livefist that concept UCAV is tied in several ways to the fifth generation AMCA development (Livefist had a big update here this weekon the AMCA), which itself could see technology infusions from a line-up of interested suitors, including Saab, Boeing and Dassault Aviation.

But there *was* a thread here, a few months back, around mid-December, *just* as the DeMo cash shortage was *starting* to ease off, and Modi's popularity was supposedly at its lowest. The post asked for people to comment on whether they were for or against Modi/BJP (I forget which). 

A *lot* of people replied, mostly one-word comments, largely by people who rarely comment, if ever. Both, the comments and the votes reflected that the vast majority of posters, I'd say &gt;70% were pro-Modi. A few of them elaborated that they had not been supporters but were now pro, and were tentatively being optimistic about him. About 5% out of the Pro camp, were regular and active commenters who tended to view the government favourably, (although almost all of them disagree with, and are critical of, the government/party on at least a few points). I don't think even a single regular commenter who was pro gave more than a 1-5 word response in the top-level comments.

Unsurprisingly, about 25% were simply anti-Modi (one-word replies) with a few commenting on how they used to be supporters but DeMo either affected them personally or they felt it was bad for the economy/country as a whole. A few others asserted that they had always been against Modi and still were.

The last &lt;5% though, were absolutely *frothing* at the other commenters, essentially going ballistic about *how dare* people still like Modi, and ranting about their talking-points. They were the usual crowd, and if you've been around here for more than a month, you already know all their usernames. They alone post between 20-40% of the content on r/india, with *every last post* being something negative about India/Government/BJP/Modi. They are the exact same ones who will *always* comment, *without fail* on *every single post* that depicts India/BJP/Modi in a poor light, regardless of how trivial, sensationalized, or misleadingly click-bait-y the post is. They are almost *always* missing from any post that is positive, unless it has over 15-20 comments and is reaching the top of r/india, and even then, it will only be to mock and make snarky remarks at the people/article/post. And there is not even one among them who I can say is even remotely capable of the slightest bit of nuance, or giving credit where it is due. 

It's pretty sad to see this group tbh. They're so invested in their views, that in their pursuit of vindication, they seem to actively be hoping and rooting for *our government* to fail. I've witnessed at least two of them say that there is *nothing* that the government can do, no matter how positive, that would make them view it favourably, or even give it the benefit of doubt.

So it's clearly a small group, but they're *extremely* vocal and active, while the larger majority tends to be neutral-to-positive, but is relatively silent.

Again, it's nothing concrete, but my observation is all I have to go by, given that there is little other way to collect reliable data (especially about the views of lurkers). Vote-patterns tend to also be revealing. But I'm not going to get into it here.",2017-02-18 00:56:18

&gt; * The utterly complex local timetable which can take railway officials over a fortnight to chalk out won't rob them of sleep as often, thanks to the brainpower from IIT-Bombay.A team of professors from the Indian Institute of Technology here collaborated with the Central Railway to write algorithms that have simplified the process of creating railway timetables to a degree that the suburban railway schedules can be created in as little as five minutes.With the software it has developed, the team created a periodic timetable that unifies the many processes rail staff would need to employ.

&gt; * The new system is not only a notch above the existing scheduling process, but it also sidesteps various bumps the railways faces, such as fluctuating number of rakes, availability of platforms at certain terminals, and various glitches and deficiencies the railways battle every day.The professors predict that the software would in time be adopted by suburban rail networks across the country with small tweaks to suit each city's requirements.On Thursday, a team comprising Professors Narayan Rangaraj and Madhu Belur, M Tech scholar Soumya Dutta and Central Railway's deputy chief operations manager (goods) KN Singh gave a presentation on the software to the railway's operations department.The authorities that sat in on the meet included chief operations manager RD Sharma and senior divisional operations manager Anil Patke.Central Railway's chief public relations officer Narendra Patil told Mumbai Mirror that they had been working on this project with the IIT professors for the last two years.

&gt; * ""This will not only help us in more efficient and easier planning but also give us a lot of options for adopting time tables for suburban operations according to our needs,"" added Patil.Professor Rangaraj, from IIT-B's Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, said he and his colleagues wanted to help the railway administration with planning things by employing updated planning tools.

&gt; * ""With the help of this software, you can also easily find out how many trains you can ply on the given routes,"" he said.The project has been chosen to be presented at a global seminar by the International Association of Railway Operations Research (IAROR) in France to be held in the first week of April.

&gt; * In its petition, Lokniti Foundation, had prayed that The Aadhar Card or such other biometric identification may be made compulsory for verification of the mobile phone subscribers that can ensure 100% verification of mobile phone, but pursuant to the attorney generals submission, it appears that the bench has decided to not purposefully violate the constitution benchs order that keeps getting a biometric UID/Aadhaar number voluntary (although some concerns have been raised whether it does condone the mandatory usage of Aadhaar at a later date).

Bobde and Nagappan observed, we are also of the opinion that the institutional integrity and judicial discipline require that pronouncement made by larger Benches of this Court cannot be ignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately explaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements made by such larger Benches. Its order reads: By a reasoned order, the matters are referred to a Bench of appropriate strength. It further said, The Union of India shall give wide publicity in the electronic and print media including radio and television networks that it is not mandatory for a citizen to obtain an Aadhaar card; The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition for obtaining any benefits otherwise due to a citizen.

&gt; * Meanwhile, following the attorney generals submission in the Supreme Court recorded in the February 6 order stating that Aadhaar is not mandatory for telephone connections, keeping the orders of several high courts in mind and pursuant to the revised order of the EC, there is a logical legal obligation for government and non-governmental agencies who are implementing Aadhaar-related schemes and systems to use the order of the EC as a template to revise their orders and circulars to comply with the courts order in letter and spirit.

150,"A lot of countries inherited the British legal system and did well - see Australia and much of the Anglosphere. I'm not sure if blaming the British is really relevant, even if it makes you feel better. 

Also, nothing has prevented India from devising its own system if its unhappy with the one its inherited. The problem here is not the system, but the culture of corruption. No matter how good your system is, if the people are easily corrupted then it will fail to deliver adequate justice. 

The judicial branch especially is one area which has been extremely neglected in India and the Modi government has done nothing about it, like all previous governments. ",2017-02-18 10:01:03

152,"To my mind, there are two major challenges. 

The **first** is the black economy. It was estimated at around 5% at the time of independence but now the latest estimate is closer to 62%. There have been 40 commissions on the topic in India over the years and some of them have been doing estimates. It has been an-ever rising trend. 

In fact, according to Arun Kumar, India's leading authority on the black economy, India [would have a 15 trillion dollar economy](https://youtu.be/AHTVbMV5x9w?t=27m7s) right now if it had no black economy. 

The **second** challenge is insufficient job creation in the formal sector. Creating jobs, as measured by the NSSO surveys, is not enough. That's because most people in India don't have formal contracts with employer and social benefits. 

This is problematic for poverty, because it leaves them *very* vulnerable for even minor shocks such as an child going ill and needing attention at home. But there are also economic implications, because informal employment is typically very low productivity. 

This means that if a large portion of society remains stuck in informal work, then India's GDP growth will taper off as it moves up the value chain. Already, India has a much larger share of informal employment than even peer countries like Vietnam. China only has 25%, whereas India is at 93%. I'm not counting informal employees in the organised sector(because they are a lot closer to productivity to those in the unorganised sector). I'm just counting those with formal contracts, wherever they work. 

The total amount of formal employment in India has been [very slow](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=15804). From 1991 to 2011 it only increased by about 8 million jobs even as the workforce expanded by 230 million. Modi talked loosely about creating two crores jobs per year.

There are naturally religious sorts or conservative muslims who would naturally dislike 'militant' (hate that term) atheists.

For the most part from what I've noticed people from the western left of center tend to believe that it's important to introspect first, and criticize other cultures later. Problems in the middle east or the fact that there are far-right governments and theocracies in other parts of the world don't bother them as much because it's not their country.

I really don't see much of an equivalence between even this SJW position and Indians that are on social media and opposed to the BJP or Sangh.

http://nirmukta.com/2008/09/30/why-i-criticize-hinduism-the-most/

This is the general idea really.

I mean we really need to acknowledge that the West is miles ahead of the developing world, so in their eyes the middle east, India and Africa are just slightly varying levels of backwards. Which really isn't too far from reality.

Another thing - Maher, Harris, Hitchens and Dawkins are all scathingly critical of religion and all of them started with Christianity. We simply don't have that sort of thing in India. If you criticize Hindu society or hinduism you are instantly labelled as Anti Modi, Anti BJP, or anti Hindu.

There are massive differences between the right in US and India. Outright supremacism is still extremely fringe; in India outright supremacism is quite characteristic of almost every community in the country.

I am not responsible for Sangh activities or positions and I do not care what they wish for. Just like I do not care for the wishes of the mullahs and fake liberals. Your insinuations are getting tiring.

&gt;that Mamata Banerjee are literally ISIS is really stupid

Less or more stupid than *Mudiji==Literally Hitler* and *India is a fascist country* or we crossed a threshold in 2014 and India *suddenly* became intolerant? And more importantly since when did you become an opponent of hyperbolic statements that appeal more to emotion than logic and reasoning? (You thought it was reasonable to equate Putin and Modi to Hitler not because their actions warranted the comparison but because that is the *norm* or some such BS.) 

As for Momota, her appeasement of the Mullahs is quite disgusting, something for which you seem to have given her a pass, but why not the Sanghis then? She literally runs a fascist state. As I have mentioned before, you cannot criticize her policies, cannot draw cartoons and caricatures of her, can't peacefully assemble to protest *against Pakistan*, can't celebrate Hindu festivals or those are treated as second class. What would you call a fascist nation which favors Islam? ISIS is pretty close to something like that IMO. Of course she is not *literally ISIS* because she is not allowing sexual slavery, beheading and a whole host of other wonderful things but seems reasonable to compare them (again the precedent being comparisons of Modi to Hitler and your opinion about such comparisons being justified).

As the say in UP:

&gt;Krishna kare toh raas leela; hum kare toh character dheela,
Woh kare toh swami; hum kare toh hurami,
Woh kare toh chamatkar; hum kare toh balatkar,

&gt;Wanting to have sharia law is a meaningless question because it can range from sharia law in India,

Sharia law in India will imply non-Muslims are second class citizens. That is core tenet of the law. Also, you must look deeper into what the problem in Pakistan is. The lawmakers and military men decided that it was alright to call their country an *Islamic Republic* and state that they will be ruled by God's laws to appease the plebs. But the secular leaders/institutions i.e., the lawmakers and army did not actually want to give up power to the clergy. This has resulted in great confusion about the nature of the State that they have, and has backfired terribly. 

This is why an oft repeated idea of 'Hindu Nation' being tolerant it idiotic. Even though Hinduism is far more benign than Islam (IMO) it would still morph into a state where Muslims will be second class citizens and with time people will demand more orthodox rules to be implemented. 

So, that is the problem with these people wanting Sharia Law. If you cannot find it in you to criticize those who want Sharia in India then I find your rantings against Sanghis quite hypocritical. Why can't they have a Hindu nation guided by Hindu Laws? At worst it would be no better than one guided by Sharia.

&gt;If you start to demonize or subjugate a minority

In what way is this subjugation or demonization if all people are subject to the same laws? Do you even know the meaning of these words? Establishing Sharia Law in India is subjugation of non muslims and those muslims it will disadvantage (the heretics, the gays and the apostates), establishing a secular law without references to any religion is not.

176,"&gt;you don't really want to acknowledge what vast swathes of India is actually like.

I fully acknowledge what vast swathes of the nation is like, which is why I said India is not secular. I did not label it as liberal democracy nor did label it as Hindu nation.

&gt;The problem is though, is that here we're comparing INDIA with these muslim countries.

And

&gt;This is a country where we still have women murdered for being witches, human sacrifice, mass open defecation and tribal councils (khaps) where punishments like gang rape of the accused's sister as some sort of honor protection system happens.

This is contradictory. It is so strange that you point these out and yet say that the middle east is better that India. Witches are punished there too and the society is quite tribal. At least some of those barbaric punishments are not written into Indian law. As for shitting on the streets, if it had not been for the black gold, the Arabs would still be shitting in the deserts.

&gt;With Malaysia, Turkey and Jordan I'm really not sure how to convince you - if you can't actually go to these places, try watching some travel programs about them and see what their society is actually like

Like I said, numbers. Instead of opeds hard numbers will convince me. Whatever progress Turkey made under secular governments will now be reversed, and they will revert to the same level as rest of their Arabic brethren. You can go on Quora and see a large number of foreigners giving glowing reviews about India. Oh, they will mention the Cow, the pollution, the poverty and corruption but are unlikely to observe the internal tensions in the society, the same with any travelogue.

&gt;India OTOH is just barely above the absolute rock bottom of the world in terms of living standards and affluence. 

But living standards and affluence is not what we are talking about, is it? It clearly shows why you prefer travel documentaries to pew research numbers and why you judge a nation by the number of people shitting on the road. Shallow parameters for a quick judgement.

It is the society as it currently exists and the kind we want to build that is under scrutiny here. Does the Indian constitution state that the victim of a gangrape must be punished as an adulteress? Does it say that one woman's testimony = 1/4 a man's testimony? Does it allow thieves to be maimed? Does it allow criminals to be beheaded in public squares? Does it blatantly discriminate against minorities? Quite the opposite really.

&gt;Just above failed states and some of our more rubbish neighbors.

Failed states include Somalia and Afghanistan. Just putting it in perspective shows how ridiculous your statement is. But from our previous conversations (about Putin for example) you like and support hyperbole that confirm your own biases so not really surprising.

&gt;But that's Hindus implementing reform on Hindus. It's always going to be much easier to reform your own community.

The recent Triple Talaq case was filed by a Muslim lady, her case was fought and publicized by a Muslim women's advocacy group.  And yet the mullahs have opposed it. Only when the Supreme Court, like the coward it is, asked the govt to submit its opinion (why?) did this govt. get involved.

&gt;Much of Hindu society is extremely backwards compared to the West - casteist, collectivist, traditionalist, superstitious, lots of problems in how we view human rights and women : should the West go to war v/s us ? Should they try and force us to reform ? 

Looks to me like they are. Casteism and untouchabilty is illegal. I am not asking to go and rough up Muslims who do not follow the law, but surely there must be some recourse for those who do not want to abide by the Qazi's unfair judgement. Who wish to fight back against the injustice done to them by the religious clerics.

&gt;That JNU stuff -

You asked for an example of SJWs and I gave you one. Right wing, not fascists or Hindutavavadis, profs have long been driven out of our Universities. The West is only now realizing this, far leftist hold on our Universities is much stronger IMO. ABVP has learned from the best and now the Left is crying foul. In fact, Modi himself has learned from the *Family* in how to be dictatorial, develop a personality cult etc. but the liberals have only now woken up to all this it seems.

&gt;Nobody supports Maoist terrorists. Much of the clampdown on them happened during congress rule.

I merely pointed out that people die due to far left wing terrorism... a lot in this country. Surely that implies that the ideology is far from dead. MMS described it as one the biggest threat to the republic less than a decade ago.

&gt;The far-left terrorists/anarchists/separatists have zero political power, as it should be. The far-right is not that way, obviously.

I can write the exact opposite of that statement, with zero substantiations or basis, but I refuse to.

&gt;Honestly I don't even understand why people are so obsesed with Muslims in India.

Why are you obsessed with Hindutvavadis? Majority of Hindus are not Sanghis and while they hold backward beliefs they are not advocating for a Hindu nation. So why the obsession with them? Islam is at least as backward as Hinduism (and I am being generous) but your rants seem to be directed against one specific religion? Why? Why can't you just leave the Hindus to be backward? You seem content to leave Muslims to be backward.

As for the Muslims, one must be concerned about them for the reasons you wrote. How can our country progress if 20% of it's population (the absolute maximum projected population of Muslims, not current, most likely it will be lesser), more if you include SC/STs who are also in a bad shape, will always remain backward. Reason enough to care.

&gt;The statistics are messy, but communal riots where hindu extremists propagated murder, rape and destruction of property post-independence paints a worrying picture.

If you say so. But I would really like some statistics. And an explanation. How do you separate riots and killings done as retribution for actual or perceived injustice and how many done due to rumors spread by Hindutva forces or by other political factions? Congress is really not exempt from stoking communal feelings and I presume riots instigated by them and other secular parties do not count as Hindutva violence? Your statement was a complete non answer to my question.

Also, what is the obsession with *post independence*? Are you saying we are to just forget history and welcome little Taimurs? You are not going to throw that retarded thread that was doing the rounds here are you? According to OP of the thread it was really about proving *Muh Abrahamics better than Dharmics*.

&gt;What's much more worrying is that unlike America or Europe, our version of the KKK or neo-nazis is not fringe at all.

Yatha praja tatha Raja. The Muslims are no better than the Hindus and vice versa.

&gt;A lot of Hindus are becoming conservative these days too: can we really do anything about it ?

Well they do get a lot of flak for it. And I mean a lot of flak from left leaning media, and rightfully so. The minorities get a pass and I do not agree with that.

&gt;And what Muslims do in impoverished segregated parts of town have very little impact on the whole of Indian society, or the direction in which politics goes.

You are dead wrong. Religion and politics have always been deeply intertwined in India. Why do you think Mamata wanted to provide a salary to Mullahs and not to Pujaris? Muslims may not have many leaders but people know their vote counts and at least locally they can get their demands met as long as they vote as a block.",2017-02-18 23:23:10

178,"&gt; I am not responsible for Sangh activities or positions and I do not care what they wish for. Just like I do not care for the wishes of the mullahs and fake liberals. Your insinuations are getting tiring.

No what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter what you or I want for a secular legal system in India: the Sangh wants to push for a Hindu law all over the country.

There has been lots of gradual reform in muslim (and hindu) personal law post-independence, and this is what that paper was about. My point is that Sangh doesn't really want a secular law at all - they want a Hindu law. This is not necessarily a good thing because it's actually quite rubbish for things like divorce; but in a different way from muslim law. Both are bad in their own way.

&gt;Less or more stupid than Mudiji==Literally Hitler and India is a fascist country or we crossed a threshold in 2014 and India suddenly became intolerant? 

I don't say that and very few media houses in India say that. Similarly with Trump or Putin not many people call them Hitler outside of a few specific contexts. Yes of course some people exaggerate, that doesn't make it a mainstream view of any political party, or even any prominent media house.

It's far worse than calling WB a caliphate because calling WB a caliphate is used as a victimhood excuse to bring in or encourage far right hindutva activities of the worst kind. Calling Modi Hitler has no intention of bringing in terrorist anarchists or al qaeda into India. So obviously it's less harmful.

With Modi it is true that the state government of Gujarat was involved in the 2002 riots (even if he wasn't) and that many of his backers in the Sangh were involved in the riots. Targeted killings of muslims have happened under his watch (note: this doesn't mean he carried them out) - people who support this sort of violence AND carry it out are in positions of power: MP's in parliament and MLAs in state legislative assemblies. This is very very different from the ""left"" - how many actual naxalites, maoists, islamists or people wanting a caliphate are in positions of government power ? ZERO - and this is the point.

&gt;As for Momota, her appeasement of the Mullahs is quite disgusting

It's not really all that different from any left of center politician anywhere in the world. What she does isn't even all that different from what Tories like David Cameron have done in the past. You do know that Bush went to a mosque *right* after 9/11 right ? 

This is the sort of thing Mamata does. There are hoardings of Mamata banerjee wearing sikh garb, her wearing muslim garb, her with santa claus in christian areas in Christmas, and similar hoardings in core Hindu areas like Kalighat. People just see her wearing a ghomta (ghungat) when speaking to muslims and then start ridiculous conspiracy theories. CPM had always appeased muslims and so did congress before them. In a state where about 25% of the population is muslim obviously nobody would want to lose their vote.

India is a backwards country, and tribalistic attachment to communities and vote bank politics is obviously going to be more pronounced. 

&gt;Sharia law in India will imply non-Muslims are second class citizens.

It kinda depends on the country. In a lot of places non-muslims are left alone and not really discriminated in any meaningful way.

&gt;This has resulted in great confusion about the nature of the State that they have, and has backfired terribly. 

Yes probably, but on the flipside if they didn't do this Pakistan would probably be in an even worse state like Afghanistan.

&gt;This is why an oft repeated idea of 'Hindu Nation' being tolerant it idiotic. Even though Hinduism is far more benign than Islam (IMO) it would still morph into a state where Muslims will be second class citizens and with time people will demand more orthodox rules to be implemented. 

Hinduism is less benign to the rest of the world because India isn't really involved in any internationally relevant conflict zone. So Hindu society doesn't really have any strong anti-west feeling. Hindu society is naturally represented extremely well in Indian democracy, so there is no question of being oppressed - in muslim countries a lot of their population is oppressed by dictators, monarchs or extremely pervasive western interference (of course if the west didn't intervene someone else would, that's another issue).

The whole issue of global jihad and terrorism is extremely recent (post 2000s) and it's quite obvious that it all went south after the Iraq and Afghan wars.

And about being socially progressive in general ? India is more progressive than Pakistan, Yemen, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, probably Egypt and some African countries. But there are quite a few muslim countries that are on par with India or better.

Other than that I think India has always been inherently sectarian, and that intolerance has always existed.

&gt;She literally runs a fascist state

In what way is Mamata fascist ? Fascism implies majoritarian killings of a minority, totalitarianism and a cult of personality. I don't see any of these things in WB.

&gt;you cannot criticize her policies, cannot draw cartoons and caricatures of her

News channels do it all the time, people do it on twitter and facebook too. But yes of course it was really stupid of her to arrest that JU professor.

&gt;can't peacefully assemble to protest against Pakistan

What ? If this was about her not wanting to let VHP or RSS into WB that's perfectly okay imo.

&gt;can't celebrate Hindu festivals

Never happens - this is propaganda from right-wing sources that has been debunked many times.

&gt;those are treated as second class

How ? Hindu festivals dominate the landscape of WB, have you not heard of Durga Puja and Kali Puja ?

&gt;If you cannot find it in you to criticize those who want Sharia in India 

Who wants full Sharia law for everyone in India ? How much political power do they have and how many sitting MP's/MLAs directly support this ? Excuse me if I don't bother with irrelevant fearmongering that come out of far-right sources.

&gt;In what way is this subjugation or demonization if all people are subject to the same laws? 

That wasn't about UCC at all. It's the general idea of what parts of the Sangh want to do.

&gt;Tell that to the French and the Belgians.

It happens in America too with native Americans, african americans and latin americans voting en bloc for the Democrats.

&gt;but in India it makes perfect sense

Still just a conspiracy theory.
",2017-02-19 00:02:04
179,"&gt;No what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter what you or I want for a secular legal system in India: the Sangh wants to push for a Hindu law all over the country.

Discussion isn't really about Sanghis though, except you want it to be.

&gt;My point is that Sangh doesn't really want a secular law at all - they want a Hindu law.

Like I said, I don't give a shit. Opposing UCC before it is tabled is regressive. 

&gt;I don't say that and very few media houses in India say that.

You have got to be kidding me here. There are so many articles, proclaiming India is becoming fascist, how illiberal India has become and Opeds in NYT about it. This is what Award Wapasi was all about, at least that is how the media portrayed it.

&gt;It's far worse than calling WB a caliphate because calling WB a caliphate is used as a victimhood excuse to bring in or encourage far right hindutva activities of the worst kind. Calling Modi Hitler has no intention of bringing in terrorist anarchists or al qaeda into India. So obviously it's less harmful.

A convenient excuse for dishonesty and forwarding your preferred agenda, and by you I mean the media houses and the so called liberals.

&gt;With Modi it is true that the state government of Gujarat was involved in the 2002 riots (even if he wasn't) and that many of his backers in the Sangh were involved in the riots. Targeted killings of muslims have happened under his watch (note: this doesn't mean he carried them out) - people who support this sort of violence AND carry it out are in positions of power: MP's in parliament and MLAs in state legislative assemblies. This is very very different from the ""left"" - how many actual naxalites, maoists, islamists or people wanting a caliphate are in positions of government power ? ZERO - and this is the point.

Reminds me of a story about a large tree that once fell and obviously generated a lot of impact in which people of a certain minority (and electorally unimportant) religion died in droves. Now who was responsible for it? Were the people punished for it? What happened to the family to whom the tree belonged?

&gt;It kinda depends on the country. In a lot of places non-muslims are left alone and not really discriminated in any meaningful way.

Examples, and I shut up about it.

&gt; Fascism implies majoritarian killings of a minority, totalitarianism and a cult of personality.

Personality cult - check.
Control on Press - check.
Corruption - check.

It does not need mass killings.

&gt;What ? If this was about her not wanting to let VHP or RSS into WB that's perfectly okay imo.

Nope it isn't. Using that logic tomorrow BJP can bar CPI from staging protests, they are after all still commies and far left. Or Waqf organized rallies or the Owaisis and so on. They can cite communalism, but the real reason is that they dislike them.

&gt;Never happens - this is propaganda from right-wing sources that has been debunked many times.

Yeah, the HC rapped her for it. She was asking Hindus to not celebrate Durga Puja (visarjan or whatever they call it) on the day they wanted to because it coincided with Muharram. But of course it is propaganda! 

My position is the state should provide for security for both events, that is why it exists! Or religious communities should be asked to make a sacrifice alternate years, one community should not be forced to do that every year, be it the majority or minority.

&gt;That wasn't about UCC at all. It's the general idea of what parts of the Sangh want to do.

Like I have said multiple times, it is you who bring up the Sangh and not me. I have nothing to do with them and I feel that the idea of UCC has a lot of merit. If the only argument you have against it is far left fear mongering, then I think we should end this here.",2017-02-19 00:35:07

185,"&gt;politicians are all the same 

Economically more or less everyone is the same - pro poor populist with some neoliberal economics. There's corruption but this exists in every political party. Political parties in India tend to reflect the mindset of the people, and is quite representative.

Congress = corrupt, lots of infighting, doesn't really take much of a stand on important issues, looks the other way with many dangerous kinds of conservatism in every community, Machiavellian (this is a feature of Indian politics). Fallen out of favor since they have been branded by  the left, right and state populists as corrupt out of touch liberal elites - which is not undeserved as many of them are selfish opportunists with no clear ideology.

Most State level parties - extremely corrupt and thuggish regimes typically led by a cult of personality, tend to exploit caste vote banks: so you have lalu yadav, the UP yadavs and mayawati; and then mamata.

BJP - fiercely majoritarian, appease their vote banks: forward caste hindus particularly baniyas &amp; brahmins, jains. The party of NW Indian hinduism and the party of the urban 'aspirational middle class'. Openly majoritarian and when you look at the affiliations of many of their sitting MPs they are members of very obviously supremacist groups. Corruption exists in the BJP too.

On economics - most of them have similar policies. On corruption and potential damage to the economy through corruption or bungling (demonetization for example), they are similar. They all have their own problems obviously, but now since the BJP is in power people focus on them.

&gt;A lot of times they simply believe in calling out bs that is propagated from both spectrums and because perception biases exist

There are those that do that, and those that are hesitant to be critical of the likes of the BJP, Hinduism and Sangh - or Trump and the alt right if you look at America. Dave Rubin is a classic example of a so-called centrist in America being this way. Who is nothing of the sort.

&gt;Hillary didn't need to be ""equally bad"", she just needed to be sufficiently bad

Trump is infinitely worse. The American people are incredibly gullible to elect a scam artist like Trump. He's not Hitler, but he'll do enormous damage to US politics for decades and create massive amounts of instability in the world order and the economic system. Much of the criticism leveled at Hillary is irrelevant bullshit that exist in spades in the GOP. NeverHillary bernie supporters and jill stein voters are a special kind of stupid.

&gt;What a centrist would do however is not be a blind supporter and/or hater of a particular party.

There's a point at which ideologies and political parties make it clear that they are far beyond the spectrum of being moderate. Trump is an example of this, if you find him to be reasonable on a lot of issues - that's a problem.

Centrist = not far left, not far right, somewhere around the center. Centrist politics in the West is exemplified with what most mainstream western european politics is like. Trump is outside this spectrum. A source like the Economist is an example of a centrist publication.
In India where economically all parties are similar what differentiates them is social conservatism and majoritarianism. This is where what the BJP does is uniquely bad, and something no centrist should ever support.

Just like Trump, with the BJP there are issues where there simply isn't a valid centrist position - there are people who are apologists for the BJP, the Sangh, Modi or Hinduism (usually all of them) and they are extremely easy to spot. Attitudes towards demonetization are an excellent potential red flag.

&gt;If congress does something right they will appreciate it and not hate on good policies being brought out by AAP or the BJP.

The congress isn't in power at the center, neither is the AAP. Naturally the BJP will be scrutinized more.

&gt;bill that Jaitley and co got passed that absolved all political parties of limits on their banks accounts that get 'party donation fund'. 

I hope you realize how ineffective this bill is. It's nice that he wants to address it, to be fair. But don't expect any meaningful change as nobody else wants any meaningful change on this.

&gt;unless the person in question is RaGa. Then you have a license to laugh your ass off

This by itself shows your bias. Rahul Gandhi doesn't have a commanding presence, he's a mediocre speaker and doesn't enjoy much support online. He's a part of the dynasty and has little to no political experience. But he's been demonized in a very specific way that has little to do with anything I just said. He's labelled as a bumbling idiot, similar to how Mamata is targeted - which simply isn't true at all. Bush was targeted in a similar way, so was Al Gore and Ed Milliband. Anyone who does this is just getting swayed by social media propaganda.

&gt;politicians very frequently change their parties and loyalties and so supporting any one party is bs

Alka went from the congress to the AAP - which isn't really strange since the are political parties that are actually quite similar in their economics and social conservatism. Alka Lamba has very little relevance in Indian politics overall, as is the case with the AAP.

Subramanium Swamy is like an Indian alt righter - but he has a huge amount of support in the BJP base.",2017-02-19 12:25:52
186,yes.... Modi is more insider than these fake gandhis.,2017-02-19 12:31:42
187,"&gt;Discussion isn't really about Sangh

The Sangh is always relevant because they have tremendous power now and their anointed candidate is PM. Everything that happens in India is going to get linked to what hindu right wants. Because the hindu nationalist party is incumbent.

&gt;Opposing UCC

I didn't oppose UCC. Like I said, I would love for India to have a French styled hard secularism. I'm just saying why hoping for it is unrealistic.

&gt;India is becoming fascist, how illiberal India has become

India is definitely seeing a rise in Hindu supremacism - the middle class has become a lot angrier and majoritarianism is extremely mainstream. More so than the West. India definitely has always been conservative by and large but majoritarian thinking is definitely on the rise. You shouldn't need op-eds to tell you that.

&gt;people of a certain minority (and electorally unimportant) religion died in droves

Like I said before - the congress party up until the 90s before the BJP really existed contained leaders and cadres that were rabid jingoists and hindutvavadis. You should look up what the RSS did during 1984. This is one of the problems of the congress party, it often didn't have a consistent ideology and just changed it at a whim to get votes.

&gt;Examples, and I shut up about it.

Malaysia, Jordan and Turkey. Lot of the Emirates. You'll probably disagree and think India is more progressive and inclusive because of our laws. Which mean little on the ground unfortunately.

&gt;Personality cult - check.

Mamata doesn't really have a massive rabid fan following. You don't really see anything even remotely equivalent to Modi fans. People expected Mamata to be some kind of messiah to oust the CPM, obviously that was unrealistic.

&gt;Control on Press - check. 

If you watch bengali news media, they are regularly scathingly critical of Mamata. The same is true with national media and social media. Other than the 1 JU professor nothing much has happened to indicate curbs on press freedom beyond what is typical in India.

&gt;Corruption - check

TMC is extremely corrupt, just like CPM. But this has nothing to do with fascism.

I think you have an extremely distorted view of what fascism is. Hitler and Mussolini are the best examples, and it's not just about totalitarianism. Because then Stalin would be a fascist, which he was not.

&gt;It does not need mass killings.

Fascism needs supremacist thinking and subjugation of minorities - leading towards targeted killings and eventually genocide. It's a far right ideology. Neo-nazis are fascists, or more accurately neo-fascists. The KKK are fascists, the Bajrang Dal is, ISIS and AQ probably are.

&gt;Nope it isn't.

Maybe to you - I'm quite happy with not letting the RSS and VHP in WB. I don't like supremacist organizations but that's just me. And no I do not value the freedom of speech of these groups at all. I still think the congress never did enough to curb more rabid strains of hindu conservatism and this eventually destroyed them, in part.

&gt;She was asking Hindus to not celebrate Durga Puja on the day they wanted to because it coincided with Muharram

No - please do read what happened. In 1 tiny village BOTH Durga Puja and Muharram were not given permits to construct pandals. There was never any targeted attack against hindus; but of course if you want to believe the far right fringe online I can't help you.

And about delaying visarjan - what ? Durga Puja is celebrated every year in Bengal and most prominently in Kolkata, you won't find people cribbing about a delayed visarjan; most people are quite happy that there are more days to see the pretty lights and pandals. More so for out-of-towners.

&gt;My position is the state should provide for security for both events, that is why it exists! Or religious communities should be asked to make a sacrifice alternate years, one community should not be forced to do that every year, be it the majority or minority.

That's basically what happens though. It's just that in 1 village *both* pandals were not given permits as the 2 communities could not come to an agreement. Stopping hindus from celebrating durga puja is an utterly absurd claim that emanates from the Sangh IT cell. Or rather the WB BJP that finds little support from the central BJP and flocks to extremists.",2017-02-19 12:51:33

Agar Holi me bijli milit hai, to Eid par bhi bijli milni chahiye. Bhedbhav nahin hona chahiye (If a village gets a graveyard, it should get a cremation ground too. If there is electricity during Ramzan, there should be electricity during Diwali too. If there is electricity during Holi, there should be electricity during Eid too. There should not be any discrimination).”

It therefore seems that Modi was accusing the SP of discriminating on the basis of religion and caste, and was not claiming that they are singling out Hindus for special discrimination.

Indian politicians has never been shy of asking for votes in the name of religion. In the run-up to the LS elections in 2014, or the various state elections after that, the BJP too never shied away from asking votes in a religiously coloured manner ([The Cow Ad in Bihar](http://www.ndtv.com/bihar/holy-cow-bjp-ad-rubs-it-in-before-final-voting-in-bihar-1239849), [Ramzada vs. Haramzada](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/union-minister-spells-out-choice-in-delhi-ramzada-vs-haramzada/)), but at least the PM could claim that he was asking for votes in the name of development. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case any more. ",2017-02-19 17:08:25

&gt; * Further, if legal documents are not submitted the adoption will be deemed illegal and against the spirit of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the commission said.

223,"&gt; However, I don't expect people like you to criticise him or even understand this.

Firstly, you know you should really come down from your high horse if you want to actually discuss things. If you are coming here to just tom tom your intellectual superiority over others - you are really impressing no one other than yourself. 

Second, you should also try and process the world for the kind of a complicated place it is. I think you will agree with me that governance and elections are two completely different things. The keys to victory - however you may define them - could be different in both.

You *might* also agree with me that Modi stayed clean of the religious rhetoric in Lok Sabha elections. He stayed with the same message in Bihar and he lost. The other side had two previously gnawing at each other enemies hugging in a shitty, artificial embrace. However, the people bought it.

Similarly, look at the kind of shit that is happening in UP in the last few months. It is completely crappy. Eventually, Modi's ability to drive reforms is dependent on the electoral power that he collects at every level.

If you have been following the stories from UP - SP, BSP, Congress - the courting for minorities has been very open and very loud.

&gt; Ramgopal Yadav has stood by Akhilesh in the fight for control over the party. ""I will live for Muslims and die for them. If it comes to Muslims' interest, I will also fight against him (Akhilesh)"", he said.

The Nash equilibrium has forced Modi/Shah hand. They HAVE to speak to their constituencies without shitting on others. 

Modi is playing a nuanced game. He understands that people in UP are largely religious / communal / casteist little shits - so he has to get to them one way or the other. 

By the way - I hope you do realize that while this may be a little more blatant - every election everywhere goes through some version of this.

[Here](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/how-politicians-divide-conquer-and-confuse-american-workers-based-on-race/458835/)

&gt; Since the 1960s, American workers have been subjected to a steady drumbeat of political messages designed to divide them by race and class, resulting in a dramatic weakening of bargaining power and job security. That is the conclusion of an analysis of nearly 50 years worth of political and economics data by Ian Haney López, Boalt Professor of Law at U.C. Berkeley.

So - while we all love sunshine and lollipops, some of us are forced to process the tough gritty real world. Others can sit on the sidelines and judge.

Eventually, personally speaking, I want to see Modi not being able to credibly claim that his hands were tied at the end of his term. I want him to have a good chunk of power so that we can see what results he can deliver.",2017-02-19 20:49:11
224,Straws? Modi does not need my defending. He is doing fine with what he has. It is your moral high ground that I am questioning. ,2017-02-19 20:53:30
225,"Ok, seriously speaking this is how I see it...

In UP Samajwadi party has taken the appeasement to the next level. There really have been instances of discrimination with no electricity cuts during id but wasn't so during Diwali. 

So what Modi is saying isn't wrong. 

However does it mean his statement polarises the electorate? 

Imo, not exactly. The electorate is already polarised with muslims voting for sp/congress. Akhilesh's appeasement has done the polarisation already. But that's only on one axis. 

The other axis of Hindus isn't polarised and votes both sides. Modi here is trying to polarise the non polarised side against the already polarised.

If we accept AAP, Congress and sp, BJP is the other side of the coin.  ",2017-02-19 21:01:24
226,"&gt;Firstly, you know you should really come down from your high horse if you want to actually discuss things. 

Firstly, people like you should be able to criticise Modi when he resorts to blatantly communal politics. But you don't do so, instead you abuse your fellow countrymen. Here is what you said:

&gt; He understands that people in UP are largely religious / communal / casteist little shits

Maybe you should come down from your high horse and not abuse and generalise your fellow countrymen. However, for the likes of you, party comes first before the country and Modi comes before anyone else. 

You are the same guy who was telling me to get with the times and use services like ""Big Bazaar"" when I criticised demonetisation without realising that it is not even available in the majority of the country. You basically go to any lengths to defend BJP and are now writing long paragraphs to defend Modi's openly communal remarks. 

Have a little shame. ",2017-02-19 21:04:01
227,"&gt; There really have been instances of discrimination with no electricity cuts during id but wasn't so during Diwali. 

Source? 

&gt; The electorate is already polarised with muslims voting for sp/congress.

That's one way to look at it, the other would be to say that given BJP's track record, no Muslim in their right mind would vote for them.

&gt;Modi here is trying to polarise the non polarised side against the already polarised.

He is also trying to claim that the current UP government discriminates against Hindus.

&gt;If we accept AAP, Congress and sp, BJP is rhe other side of the coin. 

But we don't, we regularly call out the other parties when they indulge in religious polarisation. For some reason though, BJP supporters find religious polarisation acceptable when BJP does it. Probably because most of them are Hindus and they don't mind when they are favoured. ",2017-02-19 21:12:45
228,"All his BS about development was just a mask to hide his bigotry. So, I am not surprised with his rhetoric. Wait till 2019 to see the real ""Sanghi Modi"" again",2017-02-19 21:23:39

SP Govt is building tourism spots centres around Hinduism. But let's ignore that because it's convenient for BJP's narrative.

If we search we will find many examples of electricity cuts during Eid, but we will ignore them casually.

Propaganda works best when we cherry-pick facts instead of telling blatant lies.

Neither INC nor SP or any other party really gives a fuck about Muslims or their Development. Forget about doing more for Muslims, they don't do anything at all for Muslims but will use them as vote banks. My complaint about those parties is not that they give preference to Muslim community but instead that they don't push for reform among Muslim community.

253,"There are a lot of centrists around the world who understand that problematic minorities are better left alone. You can obviously try and promote reformist voices in their community; this is what the likes of Bill Maher and Sam Harris tend to promote - but openly majoritarian or anti-muslim policies are just akin to poking a hornet's nest. Why bother ? 


People just want to live in peace. Instability is never a good thing, and people just like to avoid unnecessary conflict on their doorstep. Obviously if there are terrorist tendencies in any community the security agencies are going to look into that - no govt on any side of the political spectrum is going to be against that. Sadly with the BJP you have cow vigilantees getting a free pass, so there's that.

If you think this way, majoritarian parties are never going to be the right choice. In countries where there simply aren't any viable center right option, a lot of fiscally conservative and center-right people will avoid the likes of Trump or even Modi. Sadly options for the center left aren't that great in India either. India doesn't really have an Angela Merkel, or David Cameron or Theresa May. Hell we don't even have the equivalents of George Bush, John McCain or Lindsey Graham. I mean what is the world coming to when these people seem moderate.",2017-02-20 01:37:13

&gt; * We saved Rs 15,192 cr in 2014-15, Rs 20,951 cr in 2015-16 and nearly Rs 14,000 Cr in 2016-17 till December 31, 2016 through DBT, the official said.The government says it has saved almost Rs 14,000 cr in its Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) by deleting 2.33 cr ration cards so far and better targeting of beneficiaries through DBT.

285,"well, I do want Chidambaram and co punished. But, let's be honest, it was easy with Amma because no Indian (high wattage A list) politician was ""dumb"" enough to openly orchestrate such an extravagant wedding. Jayalalithaa's ottiyanam (waist belt), studded with more diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor had ever seen, would alone feed an entire  starving nation. When RK Ragavan and his team entered JJ's poes garden residence all the evidence that could underpin the disproportionate  case were there in all its glory. [In 2000, it took three days for Special Court to assess Jayalalithaa-Sasikala’s jewels](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/it-took-three-days-to-assess-jaya-sasikala-jewels-in-court/article17301734.ece1?homepage=true). This kind of convenient material  evidence is not possible for  Swamy's other cases. 

Regarding Swamy's hand in JJ-Sasikala case, well, public memory is too short and the media is no exception. Sasikala's conviction has given a hero's halo for Subramanin Swamy.The media , however, has forgotten that consistency and credibility have never really been Subramaniam Swamy's virtues.

After filing case against her in 96, Swamy was in ADMK alliance and won the Madurai seat with Jayalalithaa's blessing of 12th Lok Sabha. How these two--Swamy and JJ-- tortured Vajpaayee and brought down his government merits a litany in itself. 


1. Swamy's  [Reddit chat in 1998](http://m.rediff.com/chat/suswchat.htm), he answered a question regarding his U-turn on Jayalalithaa:

""At the moment I have no cases pending against Ms Jayalalitha since in 1996 even before I entered into an alliance with her party the DMK govenment moved a petition in court and took away all my cases and vested it with the public prosecutor""

2. why didn't Swamy object to the Vajpayee Government's endeavor in helping Jayalalithaa?

[BJP had handed over the Law Ministry to the AIADMK, transferred 46 minor cases from the special courts to the regular bench and even secured the appointment of a CBI director who is not known to be inimical to her](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sonia-gandhis-turn-to-experience-jayalalitha-after-aiadmk-chief-squanders-vajpayee/1/253704.html).

It was unfortunate that our Viraat Hindu, Swamy , didn't utter a word against JJ when she got law ministry to herself. By getting that ministry , she got rid of many cases. 

Check [this](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Jayalalithaa-wealth-case-timeline-of-events/article10887817.ece) out. DMK(they are corrupt themselves, that's a different story) deserves equal,if not more,  credit for JJ's conviction. Two moves by DMK sealed the fate for JJ&amp;co. 1.moving the case to Karnataka 2. Getting BV Aacharya as the prosecutor. 

On the day of the judgement, Swamy put a tweet and  walked away with all the fame. 

Swamy is a ticking time bomb for Modi camp, now he's slightly showing signs of turning against Modi/BJP (after waiting 2 years for Ministry). For the last 2/3 weeks, he is actively supporting Sasikala ADMK government appearing on TV debates so much so that one might mistake him for an ADMK spokesperson.

&gt; * Whereas in the west the notion of ""secularism"" indicates the separation of state and religion, in India the term eventually sought to accord 'equality' to all religions  equal respect, freedom and importance.

&gt;* It is clear that if one were to look at the state budgetary allocations, Modis claims fall flat on the ground.

&gt;* As per documents available with Twocircles.net, it is clear that while Akhilesh Yadavs government has spent a sizeable amount on graveyards, it has at no point done so at the cost of crematoriums.

&gt;* On the other hand, the states rural development ministry allocated Rs 100 crore for crematoriums, while the Urban development ministry allocated Rs 100 crore for the same in urban areas.

&gt;* It must also be pointed out that the state government had also allocated Rs 400 crore for the maintenance and upkeep of graveyards (including the cost of building boundary walls) during the same period.

340,"I was pretty close to be sent to a madrasa when I was a kid but couldn't go because I was not in good health. I then joined local part time madarsas where I learnt to read the Quran and did short term courses on Islamic Studies while growing up. I'm currently doing a Diploma degree in Islamic Theology from Islamic Online University in my free time. 

 I have many close relatives and friends passing out of madarsas and can give somewhat an overview of how things work atleast in Tamil nadu.

The madarsa which I'm referring to is the biggest one in South India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Darussalam) and the students who graduate from here take the title of 'Oomeri'.

1. Most big madarsas provide both religious and secular education together with an emphasis on the religious side. Students do take 10th and 12th board exams. Some students study in the madarsa till 10th and join regular schools and colleges after that. My cousin and a close friend did exactly that.

2. I'm not sure about every madarsa but the big ones definitely give secondary school exams.

3. Students who go full time into scholar course complete their college in the madarsa itself doing advanced theological courses. They usually become either full time Islamic research scholars or go as Imams to various mosques across the world. Depending upon the location of the mosques they payscale is also attractive and comes with many benefits. And as I said majority of the students just complete the Hafiz course (memorization of the Quran) and drop out and join regular mainstream education. My cousin did civil engineering from a Chennai college and is now doing an MS in US and another friend of mine is working in Amazon and teach arabic and Quran on weekends.

4. ISIS and radicalization are spoken a lot in urban religious gatherings and not so much in rural areas. Many Muslims think they are a conspiracy by US and Israel to spoil the name of Islam and are not really Muslims. Most Indian Muslims cannot believe that a Muslim can commit such barbaric terrorist attacks so they convince themselves by telling they cannot be Muslims.  I personally belong to the Salafi school of thought and you might find it shocking but Salafis were the first group in India to raise a voice against ISIS and debunk their idealogy when they first started to appear couple of years back. We hold regular de-radicalization and ISIS debunking workshops across Chennai and Bangalore.

5. UCC is considered very threatening. Large scale mobilization was seen across the Muslim community to file the reply to the proposal for UCC. It is seen as a threat to the Muslim way of life. But thanks to that fear many Muslim organizations are looking into educating common Muslims on contentious issues like Triple Talaq and asking them to be eradicated from the Muslims society so that it cannot be used as an excuse to implement UCC.

6. I think we expected something like what Trump is doing now. Muslims across the country were/are shit scared of the 2002 riots and hold Modi as the main culprit. So naturally when he came into power it was expected that the Gujrat model would be implement nationwide. Till now we are happy it's not the case and I think Modi is in for the long game. But whatever happens BJP will never gain the Muslim votebank.

7. I'm an Urdu speaking Muslim but my native is Chennai.! So speak Hindi/Urdu and Tamil fluently. Tamil Nadu has both Tamil Muslims who are ethnic Tamilians and a significant population of Deccan Urdu speaking Muslims.

8. Sheer Kurma is my fav dish. Also love the Bread ka halwa my mom makes.

Whatever info I shared on Madarasas is purely based on personal anecdotes and experience with that once specific Madarasa. I don't know how the North Indian seminaries work and what kind of education system they follow. Poor Muslims send their kids to Madarsas primarily because they cannot afford to raise them. Full time madarsas provide free boarding &amp; food and is the main reason so many poor families send their kids and is rarely because of religious convictions.

 My personal opinion is Madarsas who do not offer normal mainstream education should not be allowed to function. Once the students complete 12th they should then decide if they want to go full time into relgious studies or go into any other traditional colleges.

Thanks OP for the questions. Hope I was able to answer atleast partially.

&gt; * Most people ET spoke to are critical of Namami Gange.The focus in Namami Gange is more cosmetic, like dressing a sick person in good clothes and pretending all is well, said Prof Vishambhar Nath Mishra, a faculty member at IIT Banaras Hindu University and president of the Sankat Mochan Foundation, which has been dedicated to the cause of Ganga since the Indira Gandhi era and through two phases of the Ganga Action Plan.Mishra said his foundation has written several times to Uma Bharti , Union minister for Ganga rejuvenation, but never got a response.Members of the consortium of IITs brought in by the Modi government to adopt and clean stretches of the river also privately lament the lack of progress.

&gt; * The project is neither wellconceived nor very scientifically planned, a senior IIT researcher involved in the exercise said on condition of anonymity.Prof Kavita Shah, coordinator for Banaras Hindu Universitys new Madan Mohan Malviya Research Centre for Ganga, blamed the lack of progress on frequent leadership changes at NMCG and poor coordination between authorities such as IIT Consortium, NMCG, IIT BHU and CPCB.Prof UK Choudhary, formerly with BHUs Ganga Research Centre, likened the current status of the programme to taking Ganga to the beauty parlour via ghats without treating her critical ailments.BJP leaders such as Varanasi mayor Ram Gopal Mohley and Shiv Sharan Pathak, who mans the PMs public relations office, blamed the state government for the lack of progress.As Varanasi prepares for polling in the assembly election on March 8, Swachch Ganga does not seem to be a key campaign issue.

&gt; * Even so, Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, who suspended his agitation on clean Ganga after Modi announced Namami Gange, last week announced that he is fielding independent candidates  Satish Agarwal from Varanasi South and Sunil Shukla from Varanasi Cantt.Swami Avimukteshwaranand, mahant of Vidya Math, said, The National Green Tribunal in its latest observation has said that not a drop of Ganga water is without pollution.

For your claim that communism leads to totalitarianism read William Blum. It has never worked? Russia in 1920s was poorer than colonized India. 30 years later they are first into space, first to give rights and achieve to universal education, universal health care, universal employment. Before you tell Stalin killed 5 trillion to get there, Brazil and dozen other countries were being ruled by worse despots. Why did not they get to space first. In fact mortality rates in those countries were much worse than USSR.

You see, its easy to claim that capitalism is working when you have education, job and health care. 70 years after independence, 30% of the population still lives in grinding poverty. With inequality increasing and poverty indicators getting worse after 1991. And that poverty line is a joke. Double that incredibly low line and something like 60-70% are in poverty.

Reading any political theory should tell you that there is no difference between Capitalism and neoliberalism. Capitalism and democracy are antithetical, Chomsky is a good source.

&gt;* A new inquiry that recently declared Hyderabad scholar Rohith Vemula an OBC and not a Dalit, as certified by a previous probe, went by the testimonials of only two people, rejecting the views of five others interviewed, an HT investigation has revealed.

&gt;* This report has been prepared under pressure from the Chandrababu Naidu-led Andhra Pradesh government, which is a close ally of the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, said Rohiths brother Raja Vemula.

&gt;* According to official records, the new inquiry headed by the joint collector of Guntur district interrogated seven people, five of whom said Rohith was a Dalit from the Mala caste.

&gt;* But Radhika was adopted by one Anjani Devi, who belongs to the Vaddera OBC community and was the headmaster of a government school in Guntur.Those who said Rohith was a Dalit included his grandfather Venkateshwarulu.

&gt;* The fresh probe prompted new accusations from Rohiths family and friends who alleged that the authorities were attempting to rewrite facts for being simply unhappy with Dandes report.

&gt; * Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the United States on Tuesday to keep an open mind on admitting skilled Indian workers, in comments that pushed back against Republican President Donald Trumps America First rhetoric on jobs.

&gt; * Modis comments reflected concern that Indias $150 billion IT services industry would suffer if the United States curbs the visas, known as H-1B, it relies on to send its software experts to the United States on project work.

&gt; * The actual number of Indian nationals working in the United States under the H-1B programme is significantly higher, however, because many visas are rolled over.

&gt; * A senior Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said India hoped to resolve the visa issue with the United States but declined to be drawn on the details.

---

&gt;* VARANASI: Varanasi is inundated with men and machines digging up every other road and lane, earthmovers stationed on already narrow roads, and huge electric cable rolls lining up on roadsides, causing traffic jams all over.The holy city on the Ganga is no pretty sight as it prepares to go to polls in two weeks from now, but clearly Prime Minister Narendra Modis Lok Sabha constituency is in the middle of a transformation: a range of central government-sanctioned projects are on simultaneously, and one can spot men at work almost everywhere.Kyoto or not, PM Modis Varanasi model is steadily taking shape.Although every authority in the town concedes that things are slower than expected, almost everybody expects results to start showing up by the end of this calendar.

&gt;* And when it goes to Lok Sabha polls in 2019, Varanasi is likely to have cleaned up its act like few other Indian cities.Amid all the dust rising up from constant and ubiquitous construction, the city proudly shows off its mint new railway station at Manduadih.

&gt;* Let us see if this time around, this round gets us to Kyoto. Modi had signed the Kashi-Kyoto protocol in August 2014 to revive Varanasi with the help of the Japanese city.There are, however, many a tricky territory en route to Kyoto.The municipality is in a difficult spot over the sewage it generates, treats and dumps into Ganga.

&gt;* The Varanasi ring road project, meant to decongest the city, was to be completed by mid-2017, but that too is delayed due to land acquisition trouble.Varanasi district magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra, however, told ET that most of the issues had been sorted out following a recent favourable order by the High Court and things will get moving post elections.

&gt;* Still, we are hopeful by 2018, Varanasi will be a highly improved and beautiful city, he told ET.The DM, however, categorically rejected any coordination issues between the Centre and the state.

It is in effect showing India that Modi has no real rival power center within his party. Nobody can stand up to him and say ""sir, respectfully, but you're wrong"". The danger here is that if his sycophants keep telling him that DeMo was a success, he could be tempted to make more unilateral disaster moves. 

And that would be the fault not of his sycophants, but of Modi, because he has systematically purged any free thinkers within the BJP as well as those he could from the outside(see the RBI). The greatest cost of DeMo may be political, not economic.",2017-02-23 09:51:07

&gt;* Union minister for labour and employment, Bandaru Dattatreya, said at a press conference this month that the Centre will ensure jobs for 5 crore unemployed people in the country by 2020.

&gt;* Total number of persons available for work among marginal workers and non-workers in 2011 census was more than 11 crore.

&gt;* If one were to take a more short-term view, governments own statistics show that employment creation in India has suffered in the recent past.

&gt;* The latest report for the second quarter of 2016 by the Labour Bureau, shows that the eight sectors of manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation &amp; restaurant, IT/ BPO, education and health, added merely 77,000 jobs in the April to June period.

&gt;* Given these realities, it is imperative that the government focuses on reviving job creating private investment rather than make tall claims, which do not stand up to scrutiny.

Somehow, even after wreaking havoc with his economic policies, the authors theorize that a loss for Modi will endanger economic reforms.

399,"To answer the question: it depends what your ambitions are. Are we talking about formal jobs or informal jobs? That's a crucial difference.

India's formal employment increased from 36,7 million in 1991 to just 44,8 million in 2011. In the same time period, India's labour force increased from 230 million to 460 million. This means that formal employment has shrunk as a share of the labour force. 

[Source](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=15804)

People have nevertheless seen sustained real wage rises in the informal sector in the last 15 years or so, so poverty has been cut substantially and standards of living have risen. But that game only works at lower levels of economic sophistication.

At some point, you need to formalise your workforce. In China, only 25% of the workforce is in informal. In India, depending on what definition you use, it's anything from 83% to 93%. People with informal *contracts* who nevertheless work in the *organised* sector are often counted as ""formal workers"" even if they have no job security, no benefits, no nothing.

Moreover, BJP is pretty amazing when it comes to actually campaigning and winning elections.

&gt;* At one point in a frequently-interrupted speech she made in parliament in 2014 on crimes against women, Dimple Yadav said her father-in-law was ""pleased that at least I am (finally) speaking"".But for this election, she has stepped it up considerably, joining her husband in taking direct aim at the PM, who is leading his party's campaign in India's most-populous state.

&gt;* Sources said she was pressured to run by father-in-law and family patriarch Mulayam Singh , who now has 22 relatives in the state's political practice, including his younger son's wife, Aparna Yadav.In the general election, Dimple Yadav's campaign for the SP was confined to her own constituency.

&gt;* And perhaps you should also look at the Lok Sabha records of some of these high-profile people,"" said an unimpressed Vijay Bahadur Pathak of the BJP.Before this campaign was launched, the Chief Minister made it clear that his wife would get top billing in the SP's promotional material.

Modi actually brought something new into Indian politics by cementing 'development' as a topic of election discourse. Whether he actually delivered on that may be debatable but it's largely due to his sweep in 2014 that last week I read a front page newspaper ad by the Shiv Sena of all parties saying *'Let's talk development, not politics!'*",2017-02-23 20:09:39
439,"&gt; First of all, the 1% IS attributed to demonetization and NOT ""random"" fluctuations. Random fluctuations, if any, will apply on top of this estimate. 

Never said that the 1% was not because of DeMo. I said, our economy regularly goes through fluctuations of around 1-2% in GDP growth rate, and it's nothing to lose sleep over. This time it was caused by DeMo. The last time it may have been caused by a drought. The time before that, by a war, or an international financial crisis, r a rise in oil prices, or a sterngthening of the dollar. Whatever. That rate of growth will come back in due time as a new equilibrium is found.

&gt;1% of potential GDP lost is close to 1.5L crores. Thats real livelihoods of people. Its not in the air as you're desperately trying to portray.

Bullshit and drama. Again, you're confusing 1% drop in *growth rate* to a 1% hit on our GDP. We're not losing 1.5L crores. Our GDP didn't *shrink*. Our economy continued to grow at 6.6%. What is this, the new ""soldier""? ""Real livelihoods"" bol diya toh no argument stands? It is *absolutely* still in the air for the next full year. Drawing conclusions about a policy as a ""disaster"" and painting it out to be the herald of the apocalypse, before even a full financial quarter has passed, is as stupid as berating the quality of a cricket team in a test-match, based on the first over. It's also like talking about the one extra run they could have scored in a span of 10 overs and lamenting its' supposed loss. Pure hypothetical crap.

&gt;It was utter devastation for many businesses and farmers. That GDP will not be added to this year's growth. If you want to live in denial its up to you.

More appeals to emotion rather than any actual point.

&gt;What ""long term"" positives are you hoping to come out of it?

&gt;We already know the long term negatives.

Uh Oh, seems like someone didn't read the article. 

&gt;&gt; India’s growth is projected to slow to 6.6 % in 2016-17 fiscal due to the strains that have emerged in the economy as a result of “temporary disruptions” caused by demonetisation, the IMF said on Wednesday.

&gt;&gt;In its annual report, however, the International Monetary Fund said demonetisation would have only short term impact on the economy **and it would bounce back to its expected growth of more than 8% in the next few years.**

&gt;&gt;“On the upside, larger than expected gains from GST and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth; while a sustained period of continued—low global energy prices would also be very beneficial to India,” it said.

&gt;&gt;The IMF said progress on important economic and structural reforms over the last year has been impressive.

&gt;&gt;“Over the past year, big bang reforms, such as the legislation of a new bankruptcy code, formalisation of inflation targeting framework, and a milestone constitutional amendment enabling implementation of the pan-India Goods and Services Tax (GST), have taken place alongside continued steps implementing the gradualist reform agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” it said.

Huh, whaddaya know, seems like the report was actually fairly positive in its' outlook, unlike that shitty headline which you swallowed whole.

Also, I'm not aware of **any** consensus on what the long-term negatives of DeMo will be. Care to enlighten me? What are these long-term negatives that you know of?

&gt;BTW, really long term negatives include diminished confidence in the our institutions and their competence.

Yeah, because we had *soooo much confidence* in our institutions before this. If BJP's current popularity is anything to go by, this has actually strengthened the public perception of our institutions among a lot of people. Just not among the anti-BJP camp.",2017-02-23 20:15:20

THE PROBLEM: they tried to defeat her, made her look bad and slander and down play her but didn't provide alternatives to policy or governance, intact most non congress govts followed the policies made by congress govts (even the current one albeit changing names in their favour) 
HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF:
Unnecessary alliances of opposition parties 
Glorious examples: AAP-Cong Delhi (AAP a anti congress party) regardless defeated BJP Almost eliminating them from the scene, RJD-JDU Bihar (JDU a party winning on anti corruption even joining with RJD who's supremo is convicted in fodder scam), SP-Cong (SP working on Lohia principles but giving rise to dynamic rule and aligning with congress who both Lohia was against)
Reason: All parties have a only one thing on their minds, defeat modi, not BJP but MODI. They all are trying to defeat modi while BJP Defeats them. 
Solution: Parties need to stand firm with their roots and ideology, bring out original policies, say no to freebies as they only amount to debt to the state.
AAP has the perfect opportunity to become a third biggie but they need atleast 3-4 states, where they have atleast a good number of seats in opposition, target the bjp bastions and capitalise on the collapse of congress in states and take their place as a opposition.

---

&gt;* Musk confirmed on Twitter to a query by Ishan Goel, who asked the CEO's plan to launch Tesla in India.

&gt;* In July last year, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari urged the US-based electric car major Tesla to make India its Asia manufacturing hub and also offered it land near major Indian ports to facilitate exports to South and South East Asian countries.

&gt;* Road Transport and Highways Minister Gadkari visited the Tesla factory near San Francisco last year and offered to promote joint ventures between the firm and Indian automobile companies with a view to introducing pollution-free road transport in India, especially commercial and public motor vehicles.

&gt;* The Model 3 will be Tesla's most affordable electric car at $35,000 (Rs 23 lakh approx) and its deliveries will start at the end of 2017.

&gt;* Tesla's entry in India also comes after Prime Minister Modi met with Elon Musk last September during his Silicon Valley tour.

True. But temp hardships with no tangible benefits is a failure. The primary objective of this move was to tackle black money and I think on that front, this move has failed abysmally.

&gt; * We just need land and a commitment from the government of India, he said.

&gt; * In India the cost of labour and the cost of building are cheaper.On the safety front, Gresta said that since the hyperloop is maintained by a self-driving structure rooted in Artificial Intelligence, human error would be eliminated.

Before sharing that link, do look at the number of states where Congress was in power in 2011-2012 and then see their performance in 2014 General Elections

&gt;I don't think you have even a basic awareness of politics. But, BJP has always been a marginal player in WB, Kerala and TN. All parties aren't equally relevant everywhere.

I don't think you even understand the argument you are making. OP asked ""Why is BJP winning like everywhere?"". So, BJP winning municipal elections in Maharastra or Gujarat is not ""winning like everywhere"". Those are states where BJP is already ruling and has lack of strong opposition. The true test of Modi's appeal lies in winning elections in areas outside BJP strongholds which is why WB, TN, Kerala, Punjab etc defeats matter. Modi is doing well where Congress is the direct opponent but failing in regions where Congress is not the main opponent.

&gt; You are going to feel really sad on March 11.

You can continue to dream. The result will be same as Bihar. If RW portals and handles made you believe BJP has a chance of crossing 130+ in UP, then get ready for some rude shocks on March 11. BJP will lose Punjab, Manipur and UP without much doubt. Question is can they come close to the majority mark in Goa and Uttarakhand.

And yeah, Modi has no chance of coming back in 2019. Cong + SP + TMC + DMK + JDU + RJD etc will result in consolidation of votes in major states. BJP has a ""catchment area"" of around 350 seats and the strike rate of BJP has to be extremely high to cross 272+ again on their own in 2019 (Most of these alliances are in the BJP's ""catchment area""). Add to that the fact BJP will be facing 10-15 years of anti-incumbency in multiple states, and you suddenly realize the challenge Modi has in 2019.

&gt;* The reference was made as the Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) alliance accused the BJP leader of playing the Hindutva card to polarize voters in the sensitive state.

&gt;* Moves to cancel a mega food park, Hindustan Paper Mills and shift a proposed Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) out of Amethi have hurt the people, he said.
