1,People ascribe way too much malice and machinations to leaders. I think Modi and his *actual* advisers know that Rajan is best placed to run RBI. Rajan knows not to overstep his limits and Swamy is just a professional troll who neither take very seriously.,2016-05-21 00:42:12
2,"Man this shit about ""oh these tamilians are so anti-Hindi, anti-India, etc."" comes up every second day here on this subreddit. Don't expect a detailed ""intellectual"" response each time it gets asked

&gt; I didnt mean to say that you start speaking Hindi, but maybe reduce the antagonism that Tamilians seem to harbour towards it.

You are making that assumption. Spend some time here in TN and talk to someone other than an auto-rickshaw driver to know how ridiculous that assumption of yours is.

And if you are referring to people not talking back to you in Hindi, you should also pretend to be a Tamilian in Delhi for a day and see how receptive people up north are to someone who speaks a foreign tongue. Be a Roman while in Rome. 

&gt; it is not hindi at all, but rather an amalgamation of various languages like punjabi, urdu, awadhi and english. The integration is a two way street.

Yeah right; Hindi-Urdu or Hindi-Punjabi have only as many things in common as Hindi-Tamil. 

&gt;UP'ites would definitely vote for DMK/AIADMK if they were to champion an ideological disposition and provide proof of a competent leadership

Yup, but before we get there, DMK has to reinvent itself and be a Yadav party full of local casteist rhetoric. Every state in India is run by local caste and class outfits. Just because BJP and Congress have failed to grasp this basic fundamental in TN politics, you now blame the people of Tamil Nadu for not being nationalistic and voting a BJP/Congress here?

&gt;Even if BJP does enter Tamil Nadu, it will still be run by Tamilians. And if the administration is exemplary then it is entirely plausible that the state leadership is asked to run the nation 

Of course, what is your point here? Truth is, they have not done that yet and Modi flies in here and speaks to the population in a language they don't understand. No surprise then that nobody voted for them. You just answered your own question about why BJP is not a favourite among people here. What do you want to know from me?",2016-05-21 01:03:51

4,"Men start to go their own way and avoid relationships with women now – Ground Report India

---

&gt;* Recently, actress Priyanka Chopra said, She does not need a man except for children. This is somewhat similar to the statement of famous feminist Gloria Steinem, women need men just like a fish needs a bicycle.

&gt;* However in a strange twist, Priyanka Chopra has found her match among some men, who are now choosing to avoid women and relationships.

&gt;* One essential tenet of MGTOW is the avoidance of legal entanglements with women, including, at the very least, marriage, cohabitation, and procreation.

&gt;* Young men and their parents are also made to run around courts for 6 months to a year as judges deliberately postpone bail hearing.

&gt;* While MGTOW men face some hostility from society and feminists in Western countries, in India they look at Ratan Tata, Narendra Modi, Atal Bihari Vajpayi and APJ Abdul Kalam for their inspiration.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Apple CEO Tim Cook has pressed for the company to be allowed to sell certified second-hand phones in India, and is likely to raise the issue at his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is unlikely to accede to the request for now.Modi, on his part, is likely to push Cook to manufacture Apple iPhones and computers in India, a person familiar with the matter said.

&gt; * ""We want to bring back preowned phone to a pristine condition for a user in the Indian market, we may have to bring in some phones to sort of fuel the supply chain and the process will be done in the country,"" Cook said in an interview to a TV channel.The government is in-principle against allowing import and sale of second-hand phones in India to prevent dumping of hazardous electronic waste, said a person familiar with the matter.

&gt; * Samsung, in fact, ran full-page advertisements in national dailies, highlighting the commitment to India through local manufacturing, R&amp;D and design centres.In an interview to NDTV, Cook said the phones Apple was talking about weren't ""refurbished"", and that ""it's certified pre-owned so what that means is it's a new phone because it has a warranty for a new phone.

&gt; * Through these pre-owned phones, Apple wants to reach out to the price-sensitive consumers in India, where a large majority buy phones priced between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000  a segment where Apple doesn't play at all, and doesn't even intend to bring new phones in.In fact, Cook conceded that iPhone prices were high and it wanted ""to do things to lower that"", without lowering quality.

&gt; * That's why the outfit may depute special pointspersons for the coming polls.Though there is no clarity on the timing of the exercise, some sources say that June will be the month when the PM will take the next big step, not just for 2017 but till 2019.

&gt; * WASHINGTON: US lawmakers on Thursday approved amendments to a defence bill that seeks to bring India on a par with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) allies for sale of defence equipment and technology transfer, even as they voted to increase restrictions on military assistance for Pakistan , including immediately blocking $450 million in aid, unless certain conditions are met.The passage of the National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA), 2017, was the scene of much action relating to the Indian subcontinent and Asia Pacific region, as lawmakers moved to codify Washington's Asia pivot, a strategy that includes strengthening New Delhi's military muscle implicitly aimed at countering Beijing's expansionism.Sponsored by George Holding and Ami Bera (House India Caucus chairs) and the chair and ranking member of House foreign affairs committee, Ed Royce and Elliot Engel, respectively, the amendment (enhancing defense and security cooperation with India) seeks to promote greater defence trade and encourage additional military cooperation between the US and India .

&gt; * ""Given the dynamic nature of the Indo-Pacific region and its importance to our own national security and future economic growth, now is the time to build on recent successes and propel the US-India strategic partnership forward,"" US Congressman Holding said while moving the amendment, that, among other things, requires the administration to take ""such actions as may be necessary to recognise India's status as a major defence partner of the US"".

&gt; * ""The secretary of defence and secretary of state shall jointly, on an annual basis, conduct an assessment of the extent to which India possesses strategic operational capabilities to support military operations of mutual interest between the US and India,"" the amendment advised, while calling for ""approving and facilitating the transfer of advanced technology , consistent with US conventional arms transfer policy, to support combined military planning with the Indian military for missions such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, counter piracy, and maritime domain awareness missions"".The bill is by no means law yet.

&gt; * However, the omnibus $602 billion NDAA also contains severe unrelated strictures on Pakistan and recommends restrictions on the country that the US administration is not entirely comfortable with.Expressing frustration with Pakistan's failure to crack down on terrorist groups, lawmakers moved to squeeze military aid for Pakistan, including blocking a $450 million tranche, unless certain conditions are met.The amendments now require the Pentagon to certify that Pakistan is conducting military operations to disrupt the Haqqani network, not letting the network use North Waziristan as a safe haven, actively coordinate with Afghanistan's government to fight the network along their border, and certify Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups.The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or NATO was one of the pillars of the Cold War, bringing together the United States and its European allies into a political and military alliance as they fought the Communists under the USSR-led Warsaw Pact.

36,"Advantageous for BJP. People these days understand the difference between a Vidhan Sabha election and a Lok Sabha election. Example: Delhi's ""Modi for PM, Kejriwal for CM"" mandate.

Now if you look at the recent trends, almost all the election results have more or less resulted in a clear majority for a party/alliance. So people want to have strong governments and don't want to take the risk of a hung assembly, or post-poll alliance. Now, since Congress is being annihilated everywhere, it creates a vacuum in the nation politics that only BJP can fill. No other party is even close to being the primary opposition, let alone the ruling party on a national level.

Nitish babu has high ambitions, but he's not even the major alliance partner in his own state, Lalu has more seats. Even if we're assuming a third front rising to the occasion, who will give up their PM dreams to let the other one become the PM? Nitish, Lalu, Mulayam, Mamta, Mayawati, Sharad Pawar, Kejriwal, RaGa, Patnaik..the list just goes on.

That is what happened with Bedi.

You know if those are the grounds for Kejriwal's hatred, Modi should be the most hated guy in India. Besides, Bedi didn't get the opportunity to reach this level.

But it still remains that those degrees are verified and the onus is on you to prove to others it is fake. So far you don't even have a logical argument for how Modi could make a fresh fake with such obvious mistakes given his resources. You not being convinced is irrelevant.",2016-05-22 19:42:17

&gt;* In the recently concluded elections in Puducherry, Congress won 15 and its ally DMK two.

&gt;* BJP leader and former IPS officer Kiran Bedi was on Sunday appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, a post which was under the additional charge of Lt Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Island for nearly two years.

&gt;* A Rashtrapati Bhawan communique said the President has been pleased to appoint Ms. Kiran Bedi, to be the Lt.

&gt;* The appointment comes three days after the Congress-DMK alliance won 17 seats in the 30-member state Assembly.

&gt;* The LG post in the Union territory had been lying vacant after the Narendra Modi Government sacked UPA nominee Virendra Kataria on July 12 barely a year after he had been appointed.

If you dig deeper you will understand that cause lot of Muslims (I think Sufis and Shias) and Christians(Mainly a section Catholics) are supporting BJP and many leaders from the minority are joining its ranks. BJP or RSS don't proclaim that Hinduism is the dominant religion and ""others"" must fall in line by embracing it. 

As I understand hindutva it maintains that every Indian is of Hindu culture or heritage ( Muslims and Christians being Hindus converted by outsiders).  This brand of hindutva has roots in self respect and organisation (great stuff) but also parochial and archaic beliefs : India is/was great and no one gets to tarnish its honour. You are nationalist if you do certain stuff like raising slogans. Exaggerating the threat posed by minorities ( not so great stuff)

And not many minorities support BJP afaik.

&gt;No party is corruption free in the Indian system its a fact, anyone denying it lives in fools paradise. What BJP has managed is reduce red tape and increase the ease of doing business and reducing corruption at the central level for obtaining clearances.

With the current demonization of the media (to a certain extent deserved) the only sources that are purported to be reliable by the establishment are that of the establishment itself. Though prima facie things seem better in some areas.

&gt;BJP is trying to reinvent itself and become more inclusive but the MSM and its rivals won't give it a chance.

I don't think MSM can make or mar such a reinvention. Also I don't believe realpolitik practised by Modi and Shah involves reinvention. Slogans and speeches yes. But the rank and file knows it has the support of head honchos in hara kiri. Modi follows a number of social media riff raff who wantonly propagate hate.

I must say you have your head in sand.

&gt; Are Hindus at risk of losing life or limb?

How conveniently you forget the Kashmiri Hindus? Burning of all in Godhra? If Hindus retaliate, the media becomes cry baby on how Muslims are being killed. Shame on these vultures.

&gt; Are Hindus not allowed to practise or propagate their religious beliefs?

Hindus dont propagate to proselytize. Neither do they have words like kafir or ""will burn in hell"". Look for missionary activities and conversions to Islam. 

&gt; Are Hindus bring discriminated against in employment or domicile/housing opportunities? 

You are parroting what media shows all the time. Doesn't the reverse happen? i.e. Hindus being discriminated

If it didnt show up in news, it did not happen. right?

&gt; Well wasn't polarisation/consolidation of Hindu votes key to its victory in Assam?

Isnt that how democracy works? Majority (you can be thankful that Islam isnt a majority here) voters decide who wins.

&gt;  Has secularism not being reduced to a cuss word?

You dont know how secularism works. Unless you wear a topi and goto iftaar, you are not secular. Are you fucking kidding me?

what happens to Muslim is what everyone asks. Are they babies or the vote banks in whose minds you want to create fear? remember the otherwise dumb MMS went around telling how India will burn if Modi comes to power?

&gt; Which sources if any in the media/social media do you consider neutral?

The MSM is sold out. I dont trust them at all. 

I dont follow anyone neutral. However, I am learning to see the difference over the years. for e.g. look at the intolerance, beef, JNU - all are orchestrated campaigns. 

Unfortunately all of us go by what ""intelligentsia"" says and we dont use our brains. The award wapasi was sham, church attacks was a sham, beef issue came up only during Bihar election and fizzled away.

&gt;* India is set to launch a scale model of a reusable spacecraft on Monday, a project that in time could pit the nation against billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in the race to make access to space cheaper and easier.

&gt;* The winged vessel -- one-fifth of full size -- is due to blast off on a rocket fromSriharikota base on the southeastern coast, reach an altitude of 70 kilometers (43 miles) and glide back at supersonic speeds to Earth for a splashdown in the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Space Research Organisation said.

&gt;* ""While Indias effort is behind the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin, there are still others further behind and all of the solutions remain to be proven, both technically and from a cost perspective,"" said David Wireman, a Dallas-based managing director and aerospace specialist at consultancyAlixPartners LLP.

&gt;* ""Space is no longer a domain thats dominated by the U.S. and Europe,"" saidAjey Lele, a New Delhi-based senior fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi controls the Department of Space, whose successes give the premier an opportunity to market India as a destination for high-technology investment.

116,"&gt;&gt; No I don't think so.

&gt;I must say you have your head in sand.

Why? Because I disagreed with you? 

&gt;&gt; Are Hindus at risk of losing life or limb?

&gt;How conveniently you forget the Kashmiri Hindus? Burning of all in Godhra? If Hindus retaliate, the media becomes cry baby on how Muslims are being killed. Shame on these vultures.

Didn't I put in a rider 'to a large extent'? Of course the KPs need to have justice. Godhra as well.

But do you think retaliation is the best way? Where the administrator starts showing uncharacteristic ineptness when killings do happen. If you truly believe minority appeasement is despicable then prodding the Hindu hordes into violence is a whole new level of Adharma. And you have the gall to call out the media for pointing out the atrocities but not the killers themselves!  Are our media biased? Yes. Have they been atrocities by both religious mobs? Yes. You can't condemn some and give a clean chit to others.


&gt;&gt; Are Hindus not allowed to practise or propagate their religious beliefs?

&gt;Hindus dont propagate to proselytize. Neither do they have words like kafir or ""will burn in hell"". Look for missionary activities and conversions to Islam. 

Hindus don't. The Sangh has begun to. See the activities that Aseemanand was involved in with tribals. 

&gt;&gt; Are Hindus bring discriminated against in employment or domicile/housing opportunities? 

&gt;You are parroting what media shows all the time. Doesn't the reverse happen? i.e. Hindus being discriminated
 
Again why should I take your eyes for it
&gt;If it didnt show up in news, it did not happen. right?

Again why should I take your word for it? Does a Hindu in Bangalore, Kanpur, Meerut, Calcutta or Cochin feel discriminated against because he is a Hindu? I'm not too sure.

&gt;&gt; Well wasn't polarisation/consolidation of Hindu votes key to its victory in Assam?

&gt;Isnt that how democracy works? Majority (you can be thankful that Islam isnt a majority here) voters decide who wins.

Of course it does. The plank you use to get votes could be development or it could be scaremongering. 

&gt;&gt;  Has secularism not being reduced to a cuss word?

&gt;You dont know how secularism works. Unless you wear a topi and goto iftaar, you are not secular. Are you fucking kidding me?

&gt;what happens to Muslim is what everyone asks. Are they babies or the vote banks in whose minds you want to create fear? remember the otherwise dumb MMS went around telling how India will burn if Modi comes to power?

Media and Sangh might have a different definition but the original spirit still holds true to keeping religion apart from Government. That definition is lost in the noise.

&gt;&gt; Which sources if any in the media/social media do you consider neutral?

&gt;The MSM is sold out. I dont trust them at all. 

&gt;I dont follow anyone neutral. However, I am learning to see the difference over the years. for e.g. look at the intolerance, beef, JNU - all are orchestrated campaigns. 

&gt;Unfortunately all of us go by what ""intelligentsia"" says and we dont use our brains. The award wapasi was sham, church attacks was a sham, beef issue came up only during Bihar election and fizzled away.

&gt;You will see more issues coming up related to Ram Temple as UP elections near.

&gt;Learn to see the pattern.

Sedition chrages against students however much you might disagree with them was not wise. Subversion of universities is also not the way forward. What the congress did for 60 years is what BJP is doing now. So I guess we all have to get used to different narratives of the past and the present.

With so much hate and fear in our hearts the true issues hurting our people get ignored.

&gt; * Congress officials and Kishor declined to comment.Separately, a party source said this week that Gandhi's long-awaited promotion to take over Congress from his mother might happen ""sooner than you think"".Kishor, for one, is realistic about Congress' chances of catching up with the BJP.

&gt; * ""Since Kishor joined Gandhi's team a few months ago, the leader has set a frenetic pace, joining student protesters on the barricades, showing solidarity with drought-hit farmers and hitting the campaign trail up and down the country.He has landed rhetorical blows on Modi, taking the floor of parliament in March to liken a tax amnesty announced in the budget to a skin-lightening cream that turns black money white.The latest state polls, which also included Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal where regional parties expectedly dominated, suggest that Gandhi's impact has been limited so far.State polls are especially important for the BJP because state legislators elect members of the upper house of Parliament where PM Modi's goods and services tax bill is stuck because it does not have a majority.Some of Modi's closest advisers say they are more worried about Kishor's involvement with Congress than about Gandhi, given his impact on Modi's victory and inside knowledge of the way he thinks.But political analysts say Modi should not lose too much sleep for now.The BJP vote is expected to hold up relatively well in Uttar Pradesh as things stand, and the two main regional parties are well placed to fend off Congress, said Sanjay Kumar at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi.

Manmohan and chidu might have been stooges of a corrupt government but their economic and monetary policy was quite spot on. They got us through post 911 economic turmoil and the GDP and exports were solid through the two decades. 

Education in my opinion is necessary but not sufficient to make a great candidate for leadership and critical positions. Swamy might have great academic credentials but being in academia is a far cry from real world experience  and it does not preclude a man from going senile . And frankly swamy has been showing signs of being off his rocker ~~lately~~ for a long time with his conspiracy theories. (Remember polonium? )

147,"I'm strongly pro-Rajan, and here are just few of the reasons:

1. He has consistently been the voice of moderation and self-criticism. Remember the hysteria after Modi got elected? People get disappointed when they get carried away. Rajan urged caution, but got ignored.

2. His comments about the ""one-eyed man is king in the land of the blind"" was misunderstood for the same reasons. He was simply saying India's relative performance looks better than it is because so much of the world is in a slump. India's cyclical economic timing is simply good, so it looks stronger than it is. Again, an appeal to caution and to be thorough and not overshoot.

3. He has consistently pushed a pro-entrepreneurial culture while also demanding more attention needs to be paid to the poorest. That's a pragmatic man. In addition, he has pushed digitalisation a lot.

4. He has been hawkish on fiscal deficit and on inflation, both factors which have helped India's standing. True, he can't influence the former much, but adding public pressure has certainly been helpful. 

5. He has consistently called for more international co-ordination, in a nod to the fact that India can build up all the defences in the world, but in the end, we're growing up an in interconnected world order, and as such an emerging economy like India's is highly impacted by the actions of the likes of the Fed, ECB and the PBoC. 

The attacks on him have been fairly pathetic, and mostly nativist and xenophobic, accusing him of being ""not fully Indian"" because he was an Ivy league professor. That smacks of an inferiority complex more than anything. 

Substantiative attacks have also been lacking, given how few they have been. CPI is a better measure than WPI, because CPI covers people's actual living costs better. The people who want WPI just want to lower interest rates so they can have higher growth, but the price for that would be higher inflation. But these people don't care about stability/balance. All they care about is the headline number, even if more people get deterioating living standards. 

That's the definition of foolishness and superficiality. Let's not forget that the vast majority of Indian business CEOs want him to stay(over 90% according to polls) and most foreign economists and rating agencies have voiced strong support of him, too.

To be perfectly frank, the attacks on him resemble something more out of fear(possible future political rival) than anything else.",2016-05-23 23:32:42

&gt;* ""Chabahar can become a very big symbol of co-operation between Iran and India,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani pointed out while addressing a joint press conference with Modi in Tehran.

&gt; * In fact, Mr Modi's money problem is less one of insufficient allocations than of poor expenditure priorities.

&gt; * Using the new basis of calculation, three-quarters of this year's defence budget is for ""revenue expenditure"" - running expenses like salaries, pensions, housing, equipment maintenance, fuel, training, etc.

Investing in the Chabahar port is advantageous for India. It''s also important for Iran that this port becomes active as it has a strategic location and is in need of foreign investment. Iran''s opening means has concentrated on the nation''s rivals in the Middle East, the ramifications are also critical for Asia.
Closer ties with Iran allow New Delhi''s leaders to secure cheaper energy imports to bolster economic growth and challenge the influence of both China and Pakistan in the region. 

Iran took a step closer to energy-hungry India and Afghanistan as it looks to recover from a decade of international sanctions. Today Iran signed a three-nation agreement to develop its southern Chabahar port, a project first proposed in 2003 that had been suspended following the tightening of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. 

PM Modi carried forward the efforts of firmer PM sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee in forging close relationship with Iran while the agreements signed for development of port, laying railway line and roads are beneficial for India.

Only ND Tiwari had a bigger base at that time.  

Indira and Rajiv did not let the state leadership develop and Sonia followed that model with great success. 

But all said and done leaders like Amrindar Singh, Digivijay, Kamalnath, Ashok Gehlot, Ashok Chavhan, Rane, Vahgela, Hooda did have a base and pull before Modi wiped their base off completely. YSR was a great asset to congress too. I am leaving their corruption angle aside here. 

They can regain it, if BJP flounders and more importantly Congress allows them too. Right now Rahul Gandhi has managed to tie Amrinder's hand in Punjab and Digvijay's in MP (Jyotiraditya is a preferred choice for baba). They are still making the same mistakes.

&gt;* Differentiated by its trademark airy and bright design, products intuitively placed on wooden desks, and well-trained staff, the Apple Store is considered the gold standard in the US both for user experience and sales per outlet.

&gt;* Unlike in other industries or even among Apples competitors, Apple Store staff have fixed salaries and are not compensated by sales commissions.

203,"I did see the Pew report, but I never went through it in detail before now. Thanks for the link /u/Flying_Momo.

I would place my trust in the methodology, and not the organisation. Pew, as you say, is reputed, but even their methodology in India leaves much to be desired.

The first red light for me was that according to Pew, 10% more of the population approve of BJP's handling of communal relations than Congress' handling. That simply cannot be reflective of the sentiment across India. A vast majority of (might I add, very patriotic) Muslims I've interacted with in the past two years live in a state of fear and insecurity. And increasingly so.

Very *very* interestingly, they did not survey populations from parts of the country who would obviously not approve of Modi - J&amp;K, Himachal, all the North East states, and Kerala (Aaaand, hold your breath, Delhi!). Leaving out the political and cultural angles, that is a significant amount of population to exclude!

Although their weighting variables seem dependable (Gender, age, education, region, urbanity and probability of selection of respondent), they also mention ""The sample is disproportionately urban, but the data are weighted to reflect the actual urban/rural distribution in India"". This assumes that rural populations are all alike, and can be weighted to compensate for the disproportionate urban sample. Also, *very* important dimensions for India - caste and religion - were not taken into consideration. Bad mistakes, I would think.

You can check the methodology out-
http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/09/17/2-country-economy-seen-headed-in-right-direction-but-public-says-problems-persist/
http://www.pewglobal.org/international-survey-methodology/?country_select=India&amp;year_select=2015

These are just very superficial observations. I'm sure that a statistician will be able to draw much deeper conclusions.

In any case, I'm not disagreeing that Modi has high approval in India. I would be rather agnostic about it, and if someone asks me, I would say ""I really can't say"". I don't think either of the studies can be relied upon. I think, from my limited experience, that as /u/UmbrellaCorp1961 says, people are generally not negative about Modi, but huge sections of the population are steadily losing hope. They might still vote for BJP because of, well, um, Rahul Gandhi, but I don't know if that is agreeing with BJP's policies. I think that if in the next three years Modi can loosen the bureaucracy, especially in the farming sector, and keep playing a light communal card, we're looking at a decade or more of BJP at the centre.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Having bitten the bullet on bad loans, India's state-owned banks now need to merge into half a dozen well-capitalised institutions than can underwrite economic growth, the official overseeing the sector's overhaul said.Vinod Rai, the veteran bureaucrat appointed this year to run the new Banks Board Bureau, told Reuters the government stood ready to inject fresh funds beyond the $3.7 billion earmarked in the 2016/17 budget Restoring banks to health is vital for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revive lending, investment and create jobs for the million young Indians who join the labour market each month.Rai said stronger banks should decide which of their bad loans to shift off their balance sheets, while weaker banks need fresh capital before a round of consolidation that would cut the number of state banks to no more than six from 27 now.

&gt; * ""State banks - which account for around 70 per cent of lending in Asia's third largest economy - hold most of India's $120 billion in troubled loans after a lending spree under the last government hit trouble.The government set up the Banks Board Bureau in April to drive balance sheet improvement and consolidation the sector.

&gt; * It will evolve into an investment holding company for state-owned banks, shielding them from political interference in management appointments and lending decisions.RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has set a deadline of March 2017 to clean up the sector.Rai, a 68-year-old former auditor general of India , said consolidation has already begun with State Bank of India'smove to absorb five subsidiaries and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, a bank for women set up in 2013.He expects more mergers but declined to be specific on timeframes.Well-performing larger banks could tie up with one another, he said, while smaller, troubled lenders could be taken over once recapitalised - if they offered good value to suitors.Specifically, Bank of India - the country's third-largest state bank by assets - would not be considered a merger candidate until it was recapitalised.Kolkata-based UCO Bank, the state bank with a large presence in eastern India, would be ""re-energised"" as a standalone institution and not merged.And Indian Overseas Bank, after recapitalisation, could be absorbed by an acquirer that could leverage off its large branch network in southern India.Rai said that, with state banks trading at just 0.5 times book value, valuations were attractive for minority shareholders to subscribe to planned rights issues , alongside the government.India's state banks have been reluctant to write down loans, especially to high-profile borrowers like liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya.

&gt; * India has more than a dozen asset reconstruction companies, or ARCs, with state banks owning stakes in four.

Please enlighten me. I'd like to make sure i don't say anything wrong in the future. Isn't that the whole meaning of an educated political discussion ?  /h

My point is...you need to hold your leaders to higher standard. our mentality is ....i elected him...let him do his shit, right or wrong, as long as i am getting freebies.
I voted for Modi...i know he is doing good work. I have seen his work first hand in Gujarat. But i also know Arun Jaitley is screwing the middle class left and right. Didn't people raised their voices against what was wrong ? Didn't PM intervened ? Democracy does not ends when you cast your vote. 

Back to the point, KCR's party is not pure, lot of stuff is being done that is wrong. The whole Website shutdown happened because cases were piling against his government because of illegal orders related to payments and stuff that were passed through government treasury.
A lot of negative stuff that happens is actually stopped half way due to civil society and concerned citizens. These news rarely come up on mainline news channels. Calling people ignorant because they choose to challenge your leader's decision is not democratic. He is an CM for God sake. We should not accept anything less than perfection from him. Would you accept a patchy , makeshift job from a surgeon doing a life critical operation on you ? Your family will probably kill him if he screws up. And that is if he is lucky. 
Lets be open........

P.S , i have been living in Hyderabad for last 2 years. Moved when state was created few days later. My observations are not so positive about his work, and the way he works. But then...that is just my observations.
I moved from Delhi. Despite my reservations against Kejriwal, my last visit to Delhi has changed my mind a bit about his performance. Once again...my observations, and mine alone.

This article clearly explains why your ancedotal evidence will not be reflected in these surveys. You say Muslims are in fear, my interactions have told me that many are finding things better due to ease of applications, more approachable govt. officers, etc. 
I forgot where I read it but contrary to popular belief, today India's 52% of population lives either in urban or semi-urban areas. You criticize they did not take rural survey when they specifically mention that Modi has more support in rural areas.

Because the survey does not confirm your own limited biased ancedote doesn't mean it is false. Maybe it's just that people think differently than you. I know a lot of people like you said Muslims will never vote for Modi but in 2014 and Kerala as well as Assam, both Christians as well as Muslims especially the younger 18-40 age group are relatively supportive of Modi. I read in Kerala , BJP got 15% of Christian vote and 2nd highest vote share among the 18-40 age group of voters.  

Also terrorist attacks have been down leading to maybe more ease among minorities of having not been targeted. The whole beef ban was a controversy for a month or so and then people moved on.

The discourse was concentrated on real issues rather than just rhetoric and chest thumping.

Fuck yous don't get any bigger than that.

Basically the govt. can forcibly take over land in the name of some project and even if the project doesn't materialise they don't have to return the land back to the original owners.

&gt; 5. While the LARR Act, 2013 was applicable for the acquisition of land for private companies, the Bill changes this to acquisition for ‘private entities’.

&gt; * ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has demonstrated an increased willingness to engage in dialogue to address the concerns of the industry while balancing India's domestic interests,"" Mukesh Aghi, president USIBC said in the letter.

&gt; * These include accelerated infrastructure investment, greater openness to foreign direct investment in defense, civil aviation, railways, and insurance, passage of a bankruptcy code, and facilitating a transparent auction of key natural resources,"" the USIBC letter said.Observing that India is improving its tax regime, the letter noted that the two countries recently finalised bilateral advance pricing arrangements under which they have resolved more than 100 pending transfer pricing cases.The tax reforms presented in the latest budget were unprecedented and lay the ground work to create an attractive environment for foreign investors.

&gt; * ""As you will agree, consensus-building is challenging in democracies and the above-mentioned reforms have been critical for foreign investors, who continue to be buoyed by the vibrancy of India's investment landscape,"" Aghi said.

224,"Actor Rishi Kapoor recently criticised naming numerous national landmarks after the Nehru-Gandhis – and created a furore. Speaking with Rajlakshmi R, Kapoor discussed names defining the nation, dynasty in politics versus Bollywood – and intolerance:
Congress workers have virulently protested your remarks – are you surprised?
These protests are staged. They’re all ‘paid’ people – half aren’t even aware of the matter and simply come for some measly sum, a meal and some drinks.
These protests show the shallowness of the Congress leaders who led the protest.
I’m saddened though that some people misconstrued my question. I just appealed to the common man – who’s responded very enthusiastically.
Congress has overdone the naming game – they don’t need so many landmarks to prove that the Nehru-Gandhi family sacrificed so much for the country. I have nothing against their family. I bear them love and respect. But even so many years later, why do we have Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Kamala Nehru Park? Is this a joke?
We could understand if this happened in the 1950s-60s when most Indians were illiterate. Today, India’s becoming a literate country with great technology. We have a mind of our own – we are not in a fool’s paradise that they should keep doing these things and no-one will question them.
National assets could be named after Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Sardar Patel, Dr Ambedkar, Lata Mangeshkar – their contribution as nation-builders can’t be overlooked.
Such decisions must be questioned.
The Khans questioned intolerance under PM Modi – what are your views?
Till date, i do not know what they mean by tolerance and intolerance. These words are ambiguous.
When Congress workers were pelting stones outside my house, i was very tolerant of their violent and intolerant reaction to my views. Congress follows Mahatma Gandhi – now, their own workers have reacted violently to my simple thought, expressed non-violently.
Isn’t this intolerance?
Politics in India is worryingly dynastic – but isn’t the film industry also becoming so?
Cinema is not dynastic at all. In cinema, people must prove themselves – only then they get selected by filmmakers. In politics, people get selected first – then they work.
In cinema, there’s no nepotism. An individual succeeds only with talent and luck. There’s nothing dynastic about our family achievements. We’re proud of our surname – but each one has had to prove himself.
 Why did you choose politics – and Congress – for criticism now?
I am a tax-paying citizen of this country. When i heard about changing the name of Delhi’s Akbar Road to Maharana Pratap Road, i was piqued – is it necessary to name 64 places in New Delhi alone after the Nehrus or Gandhis, to remind the world that this family has sacrificed so much?
This question has been in the minds of all Indians for many years – i had the guts to say it.
Will you join politics?
I have no political aspirations. I’m happy being an actor. Of the 100 years of Indian cinema, our family has given 86 years to this industry.
I have no aspirations for a political career. I have not done this to gain any mileage. They haven’t given a Padma Award to recognise my 44 years of contribution whereas people junior to me by 25-30 years have received it.
But i haven’t given this issue any thought – now, even if they give me this, i may refuse it.
 You’ve been called a ‘bhakt’ on social media – are you one?
 Yes, i am a ‘bhakt’ – of God. I do puja twice a day. I respect all religions. And i respect humanity. I’m a humanist.
They’re politicising my statements. I’m not an RSS man. I’ve commented against the beef ban and appointing Gajendra Chauhan at FTII too.
People approached me for the Rajya Sabha two or three years back. I never wanted that, so i declined.
I stand by my statement today – but i am pained by the way my statements have been coloured.
Indira Gandhi, Nehruji and Rajiv Gandhi were great leaders – i have the highest respect for them. But why are people down the line us",2016-05-25 11:33:01

&gt;* While the decision helps to narrow the breadth of the law, by permitting restrictions only on speech that has a tendency to create public disorder regardless of the speakers intention, it still gives local authorities too much room for abusive application and fails to provide sufficient guidance to citizens to enable them to know what is and is not a crime.

&gt;* Journalists and editors say the number of criminal defamation cases filed by the current Tamil Nadu state government, once again led by Jayalalithaa, is staggering and has had a chilling effect on investigative reporting as media executives weigh the costs of running stories that may be critical of the chief minister.

&gt;* Among the first to challenge section 66A in the Supreme Court was law studentShreya Singhal,who filed a petition in 2012 after two young women in Maharashtra state, Shaheen Dhada and Rinu Srinivasan, were arrested for apost on Facebookquestioning the shutdown of Mumbai following the death of a powerful political leader (a case discussed under Hate Speech below).

&gt; * The answer has been staring us in the face for the past four , if not five, years: It is to end the obsession with combating inflation and start consciously planning for growth again.

&gt; * When, despite this, the CPI-based inflation rate too fell to five percent at the end of 2014 (and the WPI index of inflation became negative) the RBI, now under Raghuram Rajan, switched horses once again and began harping on the need to control inflationary expectations, to keep its policy rates unchanged.

&gt; * In 2013, when company after company began to succumb to the debt burden created by high interest rates and low demand, Rajan shifted the blame for industrys failure onto the greed, ambition and lack of scruple of Indian entrepreneurs, who had taken huge loans in preference to issuing more share capital, in order to monopolise profits and avoid diluting control of management.

&gt; * Today the Prime lending rate is 9.7 percent, but with inflation by its most comprehensive measure, the GDP deflator, at zero, this is also the real rate of interest.

Similarly, Rajiv Gandhi's speech, in which he says ""there is only one India and it belongs to us all."" That defines nationalism for me. To wholly belong to your country, and to love it - not love it unconditionally, but to love the idea of it. Nationalism can mean criticizing the government, criticizing the *netas* and the *pitas*, it can be criticizing Gandhi to Modi - but no matter who you hate, you love the idea of India, the country as a whole, faults and otherwise. 

The same applies to differences in society too. India, from the time for its' independence, has been a land of a million differences, not only the 'big' differences like Hindu and Muslim, Dalit and Brahmin but countless little ones too, so as long as differences in society and amongst people do not hurt another person, I'm all right.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Modi government has been praised all round for getting nearly 22 crore bank account .

&gt; * The account holders are poor and most of them live in far-flung rural areas.The idea behind opening bank accounts was to empower them financially by encouraging savings, easing loan delivery and direct cash transfers.

&gt; * And how is the scheme, dubbed Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), doing?In all, the JDY accounts have a balance of Rs 37,617 crore as of April 2016- or around Rs 1,700 per account.

&gt; * That's not a princely sum, but then perhaps, the account holders' economic status permits only a small balance.A survey by international financial consultancy MicroSave earlier this year revealed that around 33 per cent of JDY accounts were actually second accounts, that is, the holders already had another bank account.

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday gave its green light to India's first-ever policy on capital goods that intends to make the country a world-class hub and looks to create over 21 million additional jobs by 2025.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here.

&gt;* It will also play a pivotal role in overall manufacturing as the pillar of strength to the vision of Make in India,"" an official statement read.

&gt;* ""This is the first-ever policy for the capital goods sector with a clear objective of increasing production of capital goods from Rs 2,30,000 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 7,50,000 crore in 2025 and raising direct and indirect employment from the current 8.4 million to 30 million.

&gt;* It will increase the share of domestic production in India's demand to 80 per cent from 60 per cent, which would make India a net exporter of capital goods.It also seeks to facilitate improvement in technology depth across sub-sectors, increase skill availability, ensure mandatory standards and promote growth and capacity building of MSMEs.

&gt;* Some of the key issues addressed include availability of finance, raw material, innovation and technology, productivity, quality and environment-friendly manufacturing practices, promoting exports and creating domestic demand,"" the statement added.The whole idea is to unlock the potential of this promising sector and establish India as a global manufacturing powerhouse, said the document unveiled earlier this year.To create an ecosystem for globally-competitive capital goods sector, the policy bats for devising a long-term, stable and rationalised tax and duty structure.It also advocates adoption of a uniform Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime ensuring effective GST rate across all capital goods sub-sectors with a view to ensuring a level-playing field.

&gt;* However, social media got fixated on the idea that if Patel had been PM, we would have been a great country; and then maybe Nehru killed Bose  all kinds of things, all so far removed from fact [chuckles]!

&gt;* I grew up in Dehradoon, studied in Delhi, I first went abroad when I was 30  now these young Indians are moving around with people, and they say why should a Frenchman be greater than me, why is a Chinese guy getting respect  it must be because of that Nehru.

&gt;* And above all they dont recognize what a difficult job it was for people like Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, Patel to create a united country, to bring different people together, to give a democratic template to a society which had never known democracy, never known freedom of choice, to give women equal rights in a society that was deeply patriarchal, to at least fight against caste oppression, to allow affirmative action for Dalits and Adivasis its an extraordinary achievement.

&gt;* They thought he had outgrown his divisiveness, that the Gujarat riots were behind him, that he had become a man of development, that he would bring jobs, opportunity, growth and alongside all of this was this portrayal that Narendra Modi is a great emancipator, and anyone who has the smallest reservation about him  forget critic or opponent  is by definition an apologist or a chamcha of the Congress.

&gt;* But at the same time Ill say that young Indians have an interest in history; they want to read serious reflective stuff, but social media is not a good vehicle for understanding the complexity of our country.

&gt; * That's a touch lower than the 67 per cent who voiced the same opinion a year ago.Meanwhile, the proportion of those saying it has done a poor or very poor job has risen from 9 per cent to 16 per cent.Modi himself was perceived by nearly half the respondents to the survey (47 per cent) as a strong leader with intent who was being handicapped in delivering on that intent by those around him, a perception that could explain the slightly lower ratings.

&gt; * This also fits in with the finding that just over half (51%) felt that the strength of Brand Modi had eroded since 2014, though about one in five felt it had actually become stronger.As was the case a year ago, the Swachh Bharat programme remains the most popular of the various initiatives launched by this gover nment, with 42 per cent picking it as the best.

&gt; * While 40 per cent said the government had not kept its prom ise on black money, a little over a third felt a good beginning had been made and 15 per cent suggested that the promise had been fully kept.More than two-thirds of those polled approved of the government's foreign policy initiatives and over three-fourths felt the Pakistan policy was either courageous or realistic.

&gt; * About 35 per cent said it was entirely due to international factors and one in five insisted that inflation hadn't come down at all.The expectations from the government in its third year not surprisingly mirror these perceptions with job creation emerging as the top priority , followed by tackling farmers' woes, curbing inflation and boosting the economy .The survey was conducted by IPSOS, a global market research company in India's eight biggest cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed credit for undertaking the most reforms of any Indian government in recent times and for making India a player of note on the global stage.

&gt;* ""Today, unlike before, India is not standing in a corner,"" Mr. Modi said on Wednesday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on the eve of his government's second anniversary The PM also told the American newspaper that since he took over, India is playing a more prominent role in global affairs, with ever-stronger links with the US.Speaking at length about reform in India, PM Modi said he ""set a path for accelerated growth that the states now need to help navigate.

&gt;* """"I have actually undertaken the maximum reforms,"" Mr. Modi said while also acknowledging that he has ""an enormous task ahead"" for himself.The Prime Minister said he's opened up more of the economy to foreign investment, made changes to curb corruption, filled gaps in rural infrastructure and made it easier to do business.The PM also said that he expects the ambitious Goods and Services Tax Bill to pass this year.PM Modi laid stress on the middle path for reforms and expressed reluctance to sell state-owned enterprises, because he believes they play an important role in the economy.

&gt;* Still, he pointed to progress in divesting the government's minority stakes in them and in increasing the participation of private companies in sectors once dominated by the state.

&gt;* You can't suddenly get rid of the public sector, nor should you,"" he said.On labour laws, the Prime Minister said that efforts to amend them at the Centre are ""over now,"" and said it's up to individual states to pursue changes.Modi said he would look to states to further liberalize the country's rigid labour laws, another area seen as crucial and contentious.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Newborns may soon start getting Aadhaar as part of the Narendra Modi government's efforts to provide the unique identification number to all residents by March 2017.Plans are afoot to click infants in the hospital cradle itself and link their pictures to the details of their parents for generating Aadhaar numbers, UIDAI director general Ajay Bhushan Pandey told ET.This follows PM Modi's directive to UIDAI, after the authority crossed the 100 crore mark in April, to expedite Aadhaar enrolments and cover the remaining 28 crore residents.

&gt; * Pandey said the authority has gone into ""campaign mode"" with an aim to give ""almost every resident"" an Aadhaar number by March next year.The focus is on enrolling those aged 0-5 years, he said, since only a quarter of the residents in this group have Aadhaar cards, compared to 96% among adults ""We are now closely working with the RGI and various birth registration agencies, saying that at time of birth in the hospital itself, we can give Aadhaar by integrating it with the birth registration system,"" Pandey said.

&gt; * We are approaching other states to do that,"" he said.Under the Haryana model, the health department in the state functions as a registrar for Aadhaar enrolment, with the department personnel becoming certified Aadhaar operators for enrolling newborn babies at the birthplace in hospitals.

&gt; * Overall, state and non-state UIDAI registrars are now procuring 15,000 additional enrolment kits, shifting existing kits in saturated states to Bihar and UP and 16,045 stationary enrolment centres across the country, including in UP and Bihar, are being made mobile to adopt a camp mode.Pandey said regarding the 5-15 years age group, where 44% are tet to be provided Aadhaar numbers, UIDAI is advising states to have Aadhaar enrolment camp at least twice a year in every school and anganwadi.

307,"Real estate peak/fall cycle in India is usually about 15 years. It is long overdue and actually came very very close to collapsing in 2013. 

In real estate, there is no bubble bursting. It takes about 3-4 years to completely shatter the peak prices and come down to realistic and true prices. These 3-4 years are preceded by 2-3 years of acute stagnation in the sector.  This stagnation was at the peak in 2013. Then came Raghuram Rajan and Modi and the great promise. They managed to change the market sentiment on a giant scale and the stagnation phase did not lead to downfall as it traditionally does. The support given by Rajan's refinance policy in real estate saved the developers from the burden of interest which was crushing them since 2011.

It is really Modi and Rajan and their effect on real estate sector sentiments that averted the advent of the real estate collapse in 2013. Real Estate prices which were seen falling then have now become stable and in some regions rising.

&gt;* In the first letter, written on May 17 , Swami had called Rajan 'mentally not fully Indian' In his second letter, Swami once again accused Rajan of raising interest rate to the detriment of small and medium industries.Swamy said the governor should have known the ""inevitable consequence of rising and high interest rate and his policy was wilful and thus anti-national in intent"".Rajan, the BJP leader also claimed, has been sending confidential and sensitive financial information using unsecured Chicago University email id and publicly disparaging the BJP government.Swamy said that six allegations levelled by him against RBI governor were ""prima facie true"" and require termination of Rajan's services ""immediately"" in the ""national interest"".In his second letter to Modi within a fortnight, Swamy alleged that despite holding a sensitive and very high government post, Rajan has been making mandatory trips to the US to renew his Green Card.RBI Governor's post, Swamy added, ""is very high in the Warrant of Precedence and requires a patriotic and unconditional commitment to our nation"".Rajan, he further alleged, is a member of US dominated Group of 30 which is engaged in defending America's dominant position in the global economy.

 Nice fantasy. Make for good namo fapping sesh. Full intention? Before the elections he had many ""intentions"" how many did were full and how many were stopped by babus and lawyers? Pathetic.

He has been ""told"". What kind of BS is this? He told him to say 56"" and all that crass crap? He has not fulfilled a single promise from the manifesto. ""Told"" how innocent is this genocidal fascists is in peoples fantasies.

&gt; WSJ: How does your economic philosophy, approach to governance and views on fighting poverty differ from those of Congress? Mr. Modi: There are two ways to fight poverty.  The government can fight poverty, or the government and the poor can jointly fight poverty.  When the government tries to fight poverty, it essentially attempts to “help” the poor.  When the government and the poor join to fight poverty, the poor are empowered, made self-reliant and given the tools to transcend their poverty.  The government’s role in this joint fight is to provide the poor with resources, opportunity and hand-holding.  I believe in the joint fight against poverty.  

&gt; WSJ: I want to ask your response to these three words: President Donald Trump. Mr. Modi: If I was a political worker, I could have commented on that. But I am the prime minister of the world’s largest democracy.  My views on the internal politics of any country and that too at the peak of their election cycle won’t be in fitness of honouring democratic values. I should maintain my discipline.

---

&gt;* Mumbai: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan has said that while the eyes of the world have been on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill, a host of other significant reforms have been taking place in India, leading to macro-economic stability.Stressing that there is no substitute for good policy, Rajan said that India has stuck to a path of fiscal consolidation and taken measures to cut the fiscal deficit that had widened dramatically following the post-financial crisis stimulus.

&gt;* But it also comes across as a validation of the government's economic agenda, which includes Startup India, Jan-Dhan Yojana as well as reforms in public sector banking.

&gt;* ""The government has embarked on ambitious structural reforms to revive growth, including significant efforts in the agricultural sector to boost productivity through irrigation, insurance, and access to markets, a strong push to deregulate business, especially for startups, important efforts to improve the governance of public sector banks and to resolve distress in power distribution companies, and an immense effort to expand financial services to the excluded through the provision of bank accounts and direct benefit transfers,"" Rajan said, highlighting some of the reform measures undertaken.He said the government and the RBI had contained inflation through a combination of better food management, a new inflation framework and calibrated monetary policies and, of course, the good luck of lower energy prices.

&gt;* Such differences have been highlighted ever since maverick BJP MP Subramanian Swamy wrote to the finance minister seeking Rajan's ouster.

&gt;* The RBI governor has not responded to any of Swamy's actions.On the global front, Rajan said that the sharp contraction in China's imports over the past year has already led to spillovers through trade, confidence, tourism and remittance channels.

&gt; * Disputing the numbers cited by Chief Justice of India (CJI) T S Thakur on shortage of judges, Union Law Minister D V Sadananda Gowda Wednesday said that the demand was not backed by any scientific or empirical data.

&gt; * Gowda said that the report cited by CJI Thakur to claim that the country needed 40,000 judges was not based on any scientific research and that he would not want to comment on the exact number for want of concrete data.

&gt; * CJI Thakur, who was addressing a joint conference of chief ministers and chief justices of high courts, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gowda present on the dais, had said the country needed at least 40,000 judges to handle the avalanche of litigation.

&gt; * Responding to a question on whether the government will ever be able to reach the target of 40,000 judges (judges in the lower courts as well as judges of the Supreme Court and the 24 High Courts), Gowda said the Law Commission report given in 1987 was based on the opinion of some experts and the public.

373,"The editors have been more than happy to use subjectivity from their perspective to fit the things he says into whatever narrative they're trying to push. For example this is what he said when he talked about the whole intolerance thing. I'll only paste the relevant part as I don't want a wall of text but you should read the [whole speech](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tolerance-and-respect-for-economic-progress-Full-text-of-Raghuram-Rajans-speech-at-IIT-Delhi/articleshow/49610362.cms).

&gt;...Put differently, while you should avoid pressing the buttons that upset me to the extent possible, when you do push them you should explain carefully why that is necessary so as to move the debate forward, and how it should not be interpreted as a personal attack on me. You have to tread respectfully, assuring me that a challenge to the ideas I hold is necessary for progress. At the same time, I should endeavour to hold few ideas so closely intertwined with my personality that any attack on them is deemed an intolerable personal affront. Tolerance means not being so insecure about one's ideas that one cannot subject them to challenge - it implies a degree of detachment that is absolutely necessary for mature debate. Finally, respect requires that in the rare case when an idea is tightly associated with a group's core personality, we are extra careful about challenging it.

&gt;Tolerance can take the offense out of debate, and indeed instil respect. If I go berserk every time a particular button is pressed, rebels are tempted to press the button, while mischief-makers indeed do so. But if I do not react predictably, and instead ask button pressers to explain their concerns, rebels are forced to do the hard work of marshalling arguments. So, rebels do not press the button frivolously, while the thuggish mischief makers who abound in every group are left without an easy trigger. Tolerance and respect then lead to a good equilibrium where they reinforce each other...


If you read what he's talking about he is very level headed and he's not taking any sides. He says that there should be caution from both sides when ideas a of sensitive nature are challenged. The people challenging such ideas should not do it just for the sake of causing offence and attacking an identity while the people whose ideas are being attacked shouldn't react predictably as that is exactly the reaction the attacker is looking for.

The way it was reported in the media was with headlines like so - [Rajan Preaches Tolerance as India Beef Lynching Raises Alarm](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-31/rajan-says-india-has-always-protected-debate-right-to-differ).

398,"Rates cut 1.5%, banks passed on only 1/3rd to home loans

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India has cut key policy rates by 1.5 percentage points since January 2015 to signal lower interest rates in the economy, but home loan borrowers have got only around one-third of the benefit.This may force RBI governor Raghuram Rajan to hold off on a fresh cut next month, especially with inflation and global petroleum prices edging up.The reluctance of banks to pass on the benefit of the lower rate regime has prompted the RBI to repeatedly prod lenders to share the gain, including through a shift to a marginal cost of funds-based lending rate.Unlike UPA, the Modi government has refrained from ""advising banks"" on interest rates.Perhaps more important at this juncture is to ensure that current and past policy rate cuts transmit to lending rates, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan had said last month.

&gt;* The government and RBI were hoping that banks would be more aggressive with rate cuts from April after the finance ministry opted for sharp reduction in rates on small savings schemes such as PPF and post office deposits.In fact, the 60 basis points fall in the base or the benchmark rate of top 10 banks is in many cases more than the benefit that has accrued to home loan borrowers.

&gt;* Bank customers have always complained of being short-changed, especially when the reduction in deposit rates has been much steeper at around 120 basis points (100 basis points equal one percentage point) and impacts senior citizens the most.The tardy transmission of interest rate cuts by the central bank into the banking system may also force the RBI to adopt a wait and watch posture for now, said a source.

&gt;* Therefore, the RBI may prefer to wait and watch before cutting rates further,"" said a senior government official.Data in recent months has complicated the policy choice.

&gt;* ""The persistence of inflation in certain services warrants watching, while the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission awards will impart an upside to the baseline through direct and indirect effects,"" Rajan had said in the April review.

&gt; * Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented his report card of two years at the helm of the NDA government in a five-and-a-half-hour television talkathon over the national broadcaster, Doordarshan, terming his governments work as a the beginning of a new dawn, and the result of keeping the interests of the common man front and centre.

&gt; * Those who were benefiting from corruption will, of course, be feeling the pain of it, but the money in the treasury of India is from the common man and I will not allow any one to loot it, he said.

&gt; * We caught more than 1.62 crore fake ration cards, fake schools with teachers on their rolls receiving salaries, Mr. Modi said.

&gt; * There are some who are compelled through politics to criticise, and they will continue to do so, he said.

this is just a political play point.

[Billionaire Anil Ambani is betting that defence spending will save his business
](http://imgur.com/a/u95XH)

PART I
Just over a year ago, Indian entrepreneur Nikhil Gandhi was forced to sell a controlling stake in his heavily indebted Pipavav shipyard in the state of Gujarat. Some of the biggest conglomerates in India lined up to buy the shares in Pipavav, which builds warships for the Indian navy. Among the companies jostling for control were Anand Mahindra’s Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, the Munjal family and Anil Ambani’s Reliance group. 

Both the Munjals and Mahindra expected to win the coveted stake. Indeed, Mr Gandhi had even signed a preliminary agreement with the Munjals. But to the amazement of the other bidders, the prize went to Mr Ambani, whose Reliance group is one of the 10 most indebted companies in India, according to Credit Suisse.

Mr Ambani had never even seen the shipyard until after he had acquired the stake, according to both Mr Ambani and Mr Gandhi. But Mr Gandhi expressed confidence that his new partner, with his political and business connections, would help the shipyard thrive as India seeks to expand its naval capabilities.

“India must develop blue water capacity,” says Mr Gandhi. “The pie is very big now,” he adds, referring to the expectation that Narendra Modi, the prime minister, will raise military budgets significantly in coming years.

Mr Ambani’s acquisition of the stake, worth about $300m, is thought to have been the largest ever sale in the Indian defence industry.

Becoming the biggest shareholder of Pipavav, now renamed Reliance Defence and Engineering, was crucial to Mr Ambani’s ambition to transform his company from an indebted owner of everything from cement factories to telecoms into one of the leading private defence groups in India.
Mr Ambani is betting that defence will save Reliance. Since winning the Pipavav stake, Mr Ambani has travelled the globe, forming relations and securing contracts with defence suppliers in Russia, France and Israel to rapidly expand his defence holdings. He has applied for licences to produce equipment including submarines, satellites and helicopters.

At the end of last year, Mr Ambani signed an agreement with a Russian company to manufacture, refit and upgrade several warships for the navy at Pipavav, another one to refit submarines and a third to make helicopters for the Indian military.

But there are many who doubt that the 56-year-old Mr Ambani, known more as a dealmaker than a builder of businesses, can pull it off.

“Defence is the ultimate big boy’s game,” says one banker. “You need deep pockets and technical expertise to meet very exacting specifications.”

Some bankers in Mumbai say that Mr Ambani was at his best many years ago when he served as chief financial officer of Reliance Industries, the heart of the conglomerate his father built, before he and his powerful elder brother Mukesh broke off relations with each other. That break was at least partly because doing deals and then swiftly moving on to the next thing suited the younger brother’s personality.

To do the heavy lifting of executing on deals was far less interesting. Today, Mr Ambani is worth $3.3bn, according to Forbes, but most of that is inherited rather than money he has earned, sceptics say.

‘A big positive’

Whatever his critics say, there is agreement that Mr Ambani has a competitive advantage when it comes to the defence industry: a close relationship to Mr Modi. He was also one of the first to heed the prime minister’s call to support “Make in India”, a crucial part of his economic policy.

Indeed, Mr Gandhi chose to sell his shipyard to Mr Ambani in part because the sale had Mr Modi’s blessing, he says.

Yet precisely because he is aware of his reputation, Mr Ambani is determined to succeed and prove the naysayers wrong, his supporters claim. A marathon runner, Mr Ambani is capable of great focus when he is engaged.

Sitting with a cup of tea in his office, where the walls are lined with pictures of himself with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, Mr Modi and other dignitaries, Mr Ambani reels off the advantages of his strategic shift away from infrastructure to defence.

“For cost, quality and price the government has to outsource more to the private sector,” he says. “You are dealing with one customer, the central government. There is no regulatory uncertainty. You are creating jobs. You are contributing to Modi’s Make in India and Skill India programmes. And the return on equity is superior.”

Even better for a cash-strapped company like Reliance, defence does not require massive spending upfront. That is because most of the heavy capital commitment comes from the government, which provides financial advances to contractors.

As he builds his defence operations, Mr Ambani is responding to incentives that come directly from the prime minister’s office in New Delhi. At the centre of Mr Modi’s Make in India campaign is a desire to reduce India’s dependence on imported military equipment.

“Defence is one of the few areas where Make in India can happen,” says Sanjay Bhandarkar, head of Rothschild in India. “If they can get it right, it would be a big positive for the country.”

Today, India spends more on imported arms than any other country. “Growth in the Indian military budget is expected to outpace that of all other major defence spenders over the next five years,” says Craig Caffrey, principal analyst at IHS Jane’s.

Ninety per cent of it $40bn-$50bn military budget, the fourth-largest in the world, goes to foreign manufacturers, mostly Russia. The only things India spends more on are energy and capital equipment.

“Previously, India imported almost everything,” Mr Ambani adds. “We weren’t even making our own bulletproof vests.”

Adding value

Today, Mr Modi is encouraging foreign manufacturers to do more with Indian partners. Soon after becoming prime minister in 2014, he lifted the 26 per cent ceiling on the size of foreigners’ stakes in defence joint ventures to 49 per cent.


",2016-05-30 03:10:10
482,"PART II 

At the same time, the defence ministry requires that for every order worth a minimum of $62m, any foreign contractor has to produce 30 per cent of the value locally to reduce imports and build a more solid industrial base. “It has been one of the prime minister’s best moves,” says Deepak Parekh, founder of HDFC, a financial services group. “Today every defence maker in the world is looking to invest in India. At the same time, this will facilitate creation of jobs and save foreign exchange for the country.”

Moreover, in the past, any crumbs that did not go to overseas groups went to India’s inefficient public sector groups. But since May last year, Mr Modi has encouraged private sector companies to participate, making the sector more attractive to foreign suppliers than if they had to work only with government-owned entities.

“Even before he became prime minister, Mr Modi reached out to all the industrialists and urged them to look at defence,” says a close associate of Mr Ambani’s. “He said he wanted more to be made in India and that the public sector can’t do it.”

At the end of March, the government introduced defence procurement rules that give priority to “indigenously designed, developed and manufactured” products. “Self-reliance is a major cornerstone on which the military capability of any nation must rest,” the government said.

Companies including Adani, Bharat Forge, Mahindra and various arms of Tata Group are heeding the call and forming relations with defence groups from Britain, France and Israel to Russia and the US.

“Make in India has become the second career option for retired defence personnel,” Outlook, a weekly news magazine, said recently, referring to the corporate competition to recruit such
figures. More than a dozen three-star military commanders have joined the Pipavav shipyard, the magazine said.

Perhaps the single biggest spender in the coming years will be the Indian navy, the seventh-largest by number of ships, as it gears up to meet the growing local Chinese presence. In July, the latest Indian naval indigenisation plan was announced as part of the government’s effort to cut its dependence on foreign suppliers. That scheme calls for involving private sector Indian companies to help reduce imports.

Regional spending spree

All this explains the importance of Pipavav, which is one of two major functioning private sector shipyards and the largest dry dock for warships in the country.

There are several public sector shipyards but the backlog of orders is so long that their output is constrained.

Even while he has been building the defence business, Mr Ambani has been raising as much as $8.5bn as he sells his infrastructure assets to halve his debt, according to market analysts, in one of the more dramatic deleveraging of India’s indebted conglomerates.

He has exited the cement business by selling to Birla Corporation, another Indian conglomerate. The telecoms towers went to a North American company, while a big stake in Mumbai’s electricity business went to Public Sector Pension Investment Board, a large Canadian pension plan. Still on the block are toll roads and power plants. He plans to be debt-free by early next year.

The effort to use defence as the catalyst for growth in India comes as it is reeling from yet another procurement scandal.

The latest one concerns an order from AgustaWestland for helicopters to replace the ageing fleet that transports the prime minister and other government leaders.

“Most new acquisitions become scandals,” says Shekhar Gupta, a political columnist.

“Many are then terminated, leaving our forces with a fraction of the needed inventory, and short of spares and ammunition. Nobody is caught and punished,” he adds.

Other Asian nations are also stepping up their defence spending. The region is expected to spend $520bn on defence by 2020, according to IHS Jane’s, with China accounting for 40 per cent of the total.

Whether India’s focus on defence can help transform Mr Ambani’s business depends in large part on his ability to run the businesses he has been assembling over the past year.

“He needs to demonstrate skill at manufacturing and fiscal prudence,” says the head of a foreign bank in Mumbai. “It is a big ask.”",2016-05-30 03:10:20

&gt;* True, the Congress staunchly opposed in the Rajya Sabha the governments move to overhaul the land acquisition law brought by the UPA just a year prior on the ground that the changes being sought to be introduced by the Modi regime were anti-farmer.
