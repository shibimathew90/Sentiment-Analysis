5,"Most of these farmers spend their childhood and better part of youth in farming activities only, so alternate careers which require at least semi skilled people is out of question.

This is why when RaGa says that farmers are backbone of our nation makes me seriously doubt his IQ.

This is contribution of various sectors to Indian economy : agriculture: 13.7%, industry: 21.5%, services: 64.8% (2013) 

So agriculture contributes 13.7% while it employees 52.1% of our workforce.

It seems highly unlikely to bring green revolution in agriculture sector considering that it depends entirely on environmental conditions which are mostly unfavorable these days.

The best plan of action for our nation should be to concentrate on manufacturing &amp; services skill development while increasing agricultural productivity per acre. This is exactly what NaMo wants to achieve.

45,"The article is written by a juvenile trying to sound like an economist and foreign policy expert.
The gullible common man would have believed it except for a few telltale giveaways, like the badly written 5th standard failed English and the first sentence which mentions 'hidden achievements'. How can a narcissist and megalomaniacal person keep his achievement hidden?  That prompted me to have a closer look at the claims made by the author.

1.	BJP Govt.  convinced Saudi Arabia to not charge “On-Time Delivery”  Premium charges on Crude Oil – Young Petrolium minister  Dharmendra Pradhan &amp; External affair minister Sushma   Swaraj seal the deal. 
 What is “On-Time Delivery” Premium charges? 

Does a charge like this exist? I’m aware of Asian premium and yes Petroleum minister, Dharmendra Pradhan did raise the topic of Asian premium on his visit to Saudi Arabia and so did other Asian powers like China, South Korea &amp; Japan. As crude oil prices crashed to US$ 40 per barrel, Asian countries saw a good opportunity for Asian premium on crude oil to be removed. As of now the premium still exist. The author and great economist is very quite on who has benefited by oil prices crashing for US$ 120 during Manmohan Singh’s tenure to US$40 at the start of Modis tenure, all that the nation got was a measly Rs. 2 or 3 reduction in petrol /Diesel prices.

2.	India will  build 4 Hydropower station + Dams in Bhutan (India will  get share in Green energy will be produce in  future) 

Yes India will build 4 Hydropower stations in Buthan, but Modi or his government has contributed nothing in this; the deal was signed by the previous government. Modi and his government’s only contribution is Photo Ops, sound bites and 56 inch chest thumping.
(April 22, 2014) http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-bhutan-ink-pact-to-develop-hydropower-projects-114042200999_1.html  

3.	India will build Biggest ever dam of Nepal (China was trying hard to get that) – India will get 83% Green energy produce from that hydropower station in free – in future. 

This is the culmination of years of negotiation. The Nepalese government agreed to allow GMR in 2008 to construct the 900-megawatt Upper Karnali hydroelectric power plant in the northwest. But the project was delayed as the nascent republic was mired in instability with six government changes in as many years. Nepalese political parties also demanded greater benefits for Nepal from the scheme that is mainly aimed at exporting electricity to India.

4.	Increased  relationship with Japan and they agree to invest $30 Billion  in DMIC (Delhi – Mumbai Investment Corridor) 

Means nothing. The great leader of Burkina Faso increased relationship with Japan and they agreed to invest $ 300000 billion in their proposed school corridor.
 
5.	Increase  relationship with Vietnam and Vietnam now agree to give  contract of Oil exploration to ONGC-Videsh (UPA was not  ready to take because they are worried of china – major   conflict on south-china sea) 

The relationship with Vietnam is a continuation of previous government policy. We have been producing and selling natural gas from two blocks — LanTay and LanDo — in Vietnam for the last 30 years. India had show China the middle finger way back in 2011.

6.	Increase Oil Import from Iran despite there is ban by USA. Iran agree to sell in Indian rupees and it save our Forex. India didn’t  stop to build “Chabahar” port of Iran. 

Iran is India’s second largest supplier of crude oil since 2008, around 40% of our oil comes from Iran. India has been paying for Iranian oil in India rupees since 2013 not after Modi came to power as falsely claimed by the author.

7.	India –  Australia (NaMo is first PM to visit Australia after 28yrs)  Despite Australia is major supplier of Coal &amp; Uranium.  NaMo able to convinced Tony Abbott and now Australia   will supply Uranium for our energy production. 

The only one to benefit is Adani. India has enough coal; we do not need to import coal from Australia or any other country. We also now self sufficient in nuclear fuel, we don’t need nuclear fuel from Australia.

8.	China  favoring President lost election in Sri Lanka – Remember  UPA lost “Hambantota” port development – read latest  report of CIA where they mention RAW has major role in power  shift of Sri Lanka. Now Modi has confirmed he is visiting  Sri Lanka in April. 

More mumbo jumbo. A good excuse for one more foreign jaunt.
 
9.	With China  as Trade Deficit was increasing – NaMo force either  Anti-Dumping will be come soon or China have invest into  India. – China commit $20 billion Investment in India. 

Republic of Timbuktu has also committed to invest $2000 billion in India.
China display’s map of India without J&amp;K and Arunachal Pradesh, China issues stapled visa to Indian citizens of Arunachal Pradesh; and our great PM has agreed for Visa on arrival for the Chinese; this despite severe  opposition from intelligence agencies, the defence ministry and the home ministry. 
 
10.	On Security  – I think adding “Ajit Doval” in his team is the best  decision by NaMo. See the recent tie-up with Pantagon,  Israel &amp; Japan. Remember I.K.Gujaral as PM stop RAW’s  offensive operations in foreign countries.. Now see how we stop ‪#‎TerrorBoat and listen his word … “Any Mumbai like attack from Pakistan  and Pakistan will lose balochistan” 

It is better the author does not think, we will be spared such utter nonsense. ",2015-05-19 21:41:23
46,"11.	India  approve the Road in North east and around India china border  – Remember Just because China’s oppose ADB (Asian  Development Bank) didn’t give us fund during UPA regime   and UPA hold that file under “Environment Ministry”  node – Remember “JAYANTHI TAX” ? 

Approval and completion of projects are two different things. It will be considered an achievement if and when it is completed.

12.	India  manage to bring back 4000+ Indians from War zone Yemen  and also bring foreign nationals of 41 different countries  which put India’s name globally in rescue mission –PM Narendra Modi specially talk to Saudi Arabian king and  tell him to allow Indian Airforce planes to fly – as Saudi  Arabia was attacking on Yemen and Yemen sky was declared  NO-FLY Zone. 

In operation Safe Home Coming in 2011 over 15000 Indians were evacuated from Libya. In operation Sukoon in 2006 over 2280 Indians very evacuated from Lebanon. In 1990 the largest air evacuation in history 1,70,000 Indians were evacuated from Kuwait, this feat is unparalleled and entered in the Guinness book of world records. This was done as duty by our armed forces and the respective governments at that time. Only publicity hungry, megalomaniac like Modi will beat his 56"" chest and take credit for everything.

13.	India’s  Air defense was getting weaker day by day, NaMo has  renegotiated Rafale fighter Jets deal with France and bough  36 Jets on ASAP basis. 

The defence minister (the only minister in Modis cabinet who knows something) had proposed increasing the number of Su 30 MKI’s instead of the uber expensive Rafale. But Modi overruled him and ordered 36 Rafale fighter jets. Note; the deal is only for the fighters, does not include missiles or any ordinance, we will now be forced to buy them at super high prices as none of our existing missiles of smart ammunition are compatible with it. We have now added one more type to our already ridiculous diverse fleet of fighters with associated headache of logistics, training, syllabus, spares, ammunitions, etc.   
All this when our very own fighter Tejas is ready to be inducted in large numbers. 
LCA Tejas Takes Off with IOC-II 
http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories3154_LCA_Tejas_takes_off_with_IOC-II.htm

14.	First time  after 42yrs Indian Prime Minister visits Canada, in  Bilateral deal, Indian able convince to Canada to supply  Uranium for India’s Nuclear reactors for next 5yrs.  It will be great help to resolve India’s Power  problems. 

India is self sufficient in nuclear fuel; we don’t need uranium from Canada or any other country.

15.	Canada approve On-Arrival visa for Indian tourists. 

It’s the other way round; India is giving Canadians Visa on Arrival. 

16.	Till yet we  were buying the Nuclear Reactor from Russia or USA and it  was much like bagger kind of situation because they were  worried about usage of Nuclear reactor for some  other use. Now Narendra Modi able to convince France and  now France will make Nuclear reactor in India. On MAKE IN  INDIA efforts.. with collaboration with Indian  company. 

Yes and all these years scientist from BARC and NPCIL were twiddling their thumbs and playing with Lego toy block, waiting for Modi to visit France. 
Nuclear Power in India  http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-G-N/India/

17.	During 26th  Jan Visit of Barak Obama, NaMo convince USA to drop rule of  Nuclear fuel tracking rule and sort-out Liabilities rules  which now open the gates for next 16 Nuclear   power plant projects.  

The rest of the world has stopped constructing new nuclear power plants and are closing down their existing one. India is now the new dumping ground for the West to dump their nuclear power plant.
Does the writer even know what is the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act.; and what it means.
India’s nuclear liability law will not be amended: Government - India has given a Memorandum to the US on Friday assuring them the same. http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/indias-nuclear-liability-law-will-not-be-amended-government/

I agree that it will take some time for the government to show results and as an optimistic citizen I hope they will.

Main thing is doing something that could actually work, not do silly shit like stopping to buy coke thinking you are changing something when you're just indulging in narcissitic first world tier delusional 'activism'.",2015-05-23 11:04:08
57,"&gt;  non pol threads   

Namo Army downvotes me on non-political threads also. A lot. For very non-controversial comments.   

&gt; non randia subs   

I would think more than half of that 20K would be from randia. And Namo Army chases me on non-randia subs and downvotes me occasionally (I don't post much on non-randia subs, though). 

&gt; What's your point.

You said you are being brigaded.

58,"I personally hate the 'official' AAP after their stint with bhushan and Yadav, but you have *no* idea how inspiring the AAP was to the Indian Left (read: anything left of centre in outlook), in showing that the BJP is not invincible. That the NaMo wave can be turned right back with wnough grassroot work (which the AAP undeniably did in Delhi) and agreed, maybe a bit of populism too.",2015-05-26 08:14:47
59,"I remember reading somewhere, about someone (was it NaMo himself) talking about Weather playing a role in the psyche of the people. At this time, with the harsh summer throughout the country, untimely rains already having caused some havoc - the general public is NOT in any mood for celebration. 

I hope that BJP has some common sense, to read the public pulse and does some big policy announcements as part of this week long ""celebration"". Frank enough, nobody other than BJP are interested in celebrating their 1 year. 

Without those policy announcements, MSM and opposition will ensure that this this week long celebration joins the ""monogrammed suit"" as more of a show-off than anything else. 

What the general public wants is the same what anyone would want in such a summer, some temporary respite from the heat and some hope that a cool monsoon will come soon. 

BJP needs to read this and give some temporary policy respite and work towards a ""cool monsoon"" of development. ",2015-05-26 09:21:54
60,LOL. Even Rahul Gandhi is taking the mickey out of NaMo. I don't think there has ever been such a PM in India's history who has been such a laughing stock.,2015-05-26 22:48:17
