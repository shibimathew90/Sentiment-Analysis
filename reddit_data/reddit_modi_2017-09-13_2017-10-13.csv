**PM Narendra Modi is a very good communicator, much better than me: Rahul Gandhi** 

 ______ 
BERKELEY: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has remarked that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a ""very good communicator , much better than me"" and also that he liked the concept of 'Make in India' and Swachh Bharat'.""I am an opposition leader. But Mr. Modi is also my Prime Minister..He (Modi) has certain skills..He is a very good communicator..probably much better than me.""He understands how to give a message to three or four different groups in a crowd. So, his messaging ability is very subtle and effective,"" Gandhi said during an interactive session at the University of California in Berkeley.""What I sense..and this is something that actually would be very good if it happens...He (Modi) doesn't converse with the people he works with..Even members of parliament of the BJP come to me and tell me..that you know ..sunte nahi hai (he doesn't listen),"" said Gandhi when asked about the good things about Modi.""One thing that I think would be good is if he would speak to the people who works with him..There's lot of information that the opposition has, but he is really not interested in that input,"" he added.Asked about the good things the Modi government has done, Gandhi said: ""On what they have done well..what I like..I like the concept of Make in India, but the orientation of Make in India is slightly different than what I would do...""The orientation of Make in India is big business and lot of it is defence..My orientation of Make in India would be small and medium businesses,"" said Gandhi.""See..big businesses in India already have a lot of play. So, my thing would be to carve out a space for small and medium businesses and bring in experts like you from Silicon Valley. Also, think about taking these small and medium businesses and transform them into global companies,"" he added.""So, I do agree with the idea of Make in India..I like it..orientation is slightly different,"" he added.Gandhi further said: ""Swachh Bharat is something that Mr. Modi likes, the idea of hygiene. I think it's a good one. I don't think it's a bad one. I think this sort of stuff they are doing...open defecation and stuff..that's not a bad thing,"" said Gandhi.He also said: ""On foreign policy, our basic design was to have relationships with people around us. So, we of course have a solid relationship with the US..that's only going to get better. And we accept that India and the US are going to get closer.""But, we had a relationship with Russia..we had a certain relationship with Iran..So, that balance..for example Russia today is selling arms to Pakistan.. it's not in our interest..They have never done it before. There are reports that Russians are dealing with the Taliban..Unimaginable, 10-15 years ago,"" Gandhi remarked.""Whereas, I completely agree with their positioning as far as the US is concerned. I think they are making India vulnerable because if you look at Nepal, the Chinese are in there..Burma, the Chinese are there..Sri Lanka, the Chinese are there and in Maldives too..""In a lot of these places, these are tactical mistakes..Nepal was a tactical mistake.you know the blockade..you basically lost Nepal because you made a tactical mistake,"" Gandhi added.He also said: ""My agreement in the basic direction..I agree..friendship with US, close bond with US, but don't isolate India because its gets dangerous.""

**Rajnath Singh's visit to Jammu &amp; Kashmir checkmates separatists** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: It is customary to have high-level visits from Delhi to Srinagar if there is a crisis to defuse or when the Valley is up in flames. And all these crisis-dousing missions — whether they be all-party delegations or ministerial teams — have the sole aim of fire-fighting and the root issue is forgotten once the fire is doused.In this context, the present four-day visit of Home Minister Rajnath Singh to Jammu &amp; Kashmir, at a time when the state is relatively calm and not facing any immediate crisis, has broken this pattern and is a refreshing start to address key issues that the Narendra Modi government has been facing ever since it entered into an uneasy alliance with the PDP to share the spoils of power, feel senior government officials who spoke on conditions of anonymity.The biggest issue or rather the thorn has been why the government is not talking to the separatist leaders, although the BJP-PDP’s ‘Agenda of Alliance’ clearly spoke of continuing the principles of the Atal Behari Vajpayee government of talking to all groups, including the Hurriyat Conference, the officials pointed out. The separatists have boxed themselves into a corner and foreclosed any option of talks by calling for a strike and boycott during the Home Minister’s present visit, officials in Delhi say.This stemmed out of the on-going action by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against separatist leaders who exposed their ill-gotten wealth and links with terror funding from Pakistan. The separatist leaders cited “harassment of the leadership and use of military might against the people” for calling the strike. However, senior government officials say the separatist leaders have only ended up exposing themselves as the message has not been lost on anyone that they have opposed the Home Minister as they faced action on their personal front. However, the view in the separatist camp is that their leaders are only gaining ‘sympathy’.But Singh did play the cards right by saying on the eve of his visit, when the strike was called, that he was “willing to meet anyone who will help us in finding solutions to the problems facing J&amp;K.”He reiterated the same once he was in Srinagar, by saying that his doors were open to all. The government feels that the NIA action serves two key purposes –– one to expose the separatist leaders in the eyes of Kashmiris that the former are amassing wealth and promoting terror in the name of freedom struggle. This, the government feels, will erode the credibility of separatists, especially when the entire ambit of NIA’s probe becomes public in acourt of law.Secondly, the government believes that the NIA action has had a direct impact on reducing stone-pelting incidents in the Valley this year as funding channels from across the border have been neutralised. In the sum-all game, stone-pelting is down in J&amp;K this summer; separatist leaders are facing the heat at NIA’s hands and a record number of terrorists have been gunned down. Singh has also been able to somewhat address concerns over Section 35-A during this visit by terming it a “non-issue” and specifying that the Centre had not approached the Supreme Court on the issue.The approach is clear — strict security and investigative action against terror and separatist elements but at the same time offering the olive branch of jobs and a better life to the common Kashmiris, feel government officials. Achieving PM’s idea of a permanent solution to the J&amp;K issue “through hugs and not guns or abuse” will be achieved if the common Kashmiris believe that the Centre does not want to keep Kashmir under its thumb but wants to freely engage with it as Singh did during his visit. The Centre feels the pre-requisite for that is to make the separatist leadership irrelevant, and it is aiming to do just that.

**In loan waiver shocker, farmers of Uttar Pradesh get relief of 19 paise** 

 ______ 
Ishwar Dayal, a marginal farmer of Bhartana in Etawah of Uttar Pradesh, was in for a shock when he was handed over by district officials a certificate saying his outstanding farm loan amounting to 19 paise has been waived.

He says he couldn’t believe that such a measly amount has been waived. Equally stumped were dozens of other farmers handed out similar certificates at a programme held in the district headquarters of Etawah on Monday. Rama Nand got Rs 1.79 that he owed to the bank waived, while the certificate that Munni Lal Bholi got stated that his outstanding loan of Rs 2 had been waived.

Hundreds of farmers – big and small – have similarly been left bewildered as the Uttar Pradesh government headed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath follows up on its poll promise of waving farm loans up to Rs 1 lakh to ease agriculture distress in the state’s rural hinterland.

Promised even by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election rally in Kannauj district in February, some 86 lakh farmers across the state are expected to benefit under the scheme.

But as district after district holds such programmes to hand out loan waiver certificates to the beneficiaries, there have been shockers and genuine relief in equal measure. On Sunday, some farmers at Hamirpur had loans waived from Rs 10 to Rs 215. The next day, it was the turn of many farmers in Etawah to be taken aback.

At a programme on Monday, some 7,000 farmers were handed over certificates notifying the amount of their loans waived. According to official data, some 50 farmers got less than Rs 100 of their outstanding loans waived while the benefit for 200 of them was less than Rs 1,000 each.

“I was shocked to see the certificate of waiver of Rs 10.37 given to me in Hamirpur. I fall in the category of small and marginal farmer... I was expecting that the government would clear Rs 1 lakh against my outstanding of Rs 1.55 lakh on Kisan credit card,” said Munni Lal of Maudaha.

Reports of farmers expressing dismay poured in also from areas such as Jalaun, Kannauj, Mahoba and Farrukhabad.

Opposition parties have seized upon the opportunity to term the loan waiver exercise a fiasco. “It is laughable,” alleged Juhie Singh of the Samajwadi Party. Other opposition leaders insinuated that measly amounts were being waived just to inflate the number of beneficiaries and make the government look good.

State agricultural minister Surya Pratap Sahi, however, insisted the government was only living up to its promise. “Where is the surprise if the government has distributed the certificate to a farmer waiving Rs 100 or even less if that is the amount the farmer actually owed to the bank?” he asked. “After all, we cannot make his dues bigger or smaller”.

“There are also farmers who have had Rs 90,000 and more of their loans waived,” Sahi told HT.

Rajesh Gupta, the additional director of agriculture, also found nothing amiss in the meagre amounts being waived. “There are many farmers who paid their dues to banks in 2016-17, but some amount, which in many cases has been found to be less than Re 1, remained unpaid due to various reasons, including some mistake in interest calculation. Now we have waived only that amount and issued certificates accordingly,” he explained.

**Government moves to rework direct tax law after PM Narendra Modi’s nudge** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: After indirect taxes, the government has now set its sights on overhauling the 56-year-old direct taxes law covering income and corporation tax as it seeks to make the Indian regime more contemporary and tailor it to current requirements.Senior government officials told TOI that the finance ministry was in the process of setting up a task force to write the new tax law, an attempt which was last made in 2009 when Pranab Mukherjee released the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) prepared by P Chidambaram and his team, only to significantly dilute it a few years later.The Bill was never legislated and the Narendra Modi government had dropped plans to rewrite the Income Tax Act as it got down to removing the clutter in indirect tax through goods and services tax ( GST ). But with the Prime Minister himself commenting on the outdated nature of the law during last week's Rajaswa Gyan Sangam, the annual retreat of tax officers, the finance ministry has now started a review.Sources said the plan is to have the draft legislation ready by the Budget before it is put out for public comments. With general elections due in 2019, the government is unlikely to move to the new regime at the start of 2019-20 financial year, but may want to complete the ground work. While it is still early days, DTC had originally proposed to do away with several tax exemptions, including those available on provident fund and public provident fund at the time of withdrawal.Proposing an exemption of up to Rs 3 lakh, it had suggested that the peak rate of 30% tax apply to those with income above Rs 25 lakh, while those earning Rs 10-25 lakh were to face 20% levy. The idea was to simplify the regime and increase the threshold for taxation. For companies, too, several exemptions were to be withdrawn. While tax experts are in favour of a new law, the question is timing.""The government should give a breather to India Inc since it is already dealing with several changes such as GST, the new Companies Act and the new accounting standards,"" said Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader at Ernst &amp; Young. Rahul Garg, who leads the direct tax practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers , said starting from a zero-based approach was essential to deal with the global alignment of tax systems as well as technological invasion.

**Forced insolvency seen driving India deals to $80 billion** 

 ______ 
Overseas fund managers and companies are tracking India’s efforts to force its biggest defaulters into insolvency proceedings as interest in buying distressed assets grows, according to investment bank Moelis &amp; Co.A dozen companies in sectors including steel, power and construction may become buyout targets after the Reserve Bank of India ordered lenders to take them to insolvency court and set in motion a timeline for them to devise a restructuring plan or face liquidation. The “finite” process under a 2016 law means some offshore investors may have the confidence to “take a shot” and bid for good-quality assets, said Manisha Girotra, chief executive for the India operations of Moelis, the investment bank founded by Kenneth Moelis.“After they see a couple of test cases move smoothly, then you will probably see more interest,” Girotra said in an interview this month in Mumbai. “Let’s see how these 12 pan out but, generally, the view is far more confident on these assets getting restructured today compared to seven months ago.”Resolving India’s $180 billion pile of stressed debt has become a priority for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he struggles to kick-start capital spending in the private sector and create much-needed jobs . The central bank’s list of 12 companies, which account for about $31 billion of soured loans, is said to include Essar Steel India Ltd., Bhushan Steel Ltd. Jaypee Infratech Ltd . and ABG Shipyard Ltd. , people familiar with the matter said earlier.The National Company Law Tribunal has agreed to start insolvency proceedings against Essar Steel, Monnet Ispat &amp; Energy Ltd., Jaypee Infratech and Bhushan Steel among others. A repayment plan must now be completed within 180 days, with a 90-day extension allowed, according to the Insolvency &amp; Bankruptcy Code 2016. If a plan can’t be agreed on or no plan is submitted, the companies will move into liquidation.“It is still early stage,” Girotra said of the interest among global players. “Initially there is always caution on whether this is going to go through, or how smooth it is going to be.”She expects such stressed deals along with domestic consolidation in the financial services and fintech space to drive merger and acquisition volumes of around $70 billion to $80 billion this fiscal year, with some outbound purchases as well by pharmaceutical and technology firms.Companies struggling to meet their debt obligations have pushed defaults on bonds and syndicated loans to a record of almost $2 billion so far this year, compared with $494 million for all of 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Ashok Wadhwa, group chief executive of Ambit Private Ltd., estimates that about 100 companies are stressed with debt of around three trillion rupees. Even considering a 50 per cent haircut for banks, there will be around $25 billion of deals over the next three years, he said.“It’s a significant new business opportunity,” said Wadhwa, who leads a home-grown investment bank. “A lot of these assets are in the infrastructure space. Pension funds, infrastructure funds and sovereign funds are likely to bid along with Indian companies.”A joint venture set up by Bain Capital Credit and Indian conglomerate Piramal Enterprises Ltd. expects to complete two stressed-asset deals before March 31, Piramal Group Chairman Ajay Piramal said Aug 1. Investors including Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, TPG and KKR &amp; Co have also shown interest in investing in such assets.Moelis, which set up its India operations in 2012, added four bankers last year to take advantage of emerging opportunities and will hire three more to take its team to 20 in 2018. Girotra built the India team after previously running the local operations for UBS AG.The boutique investment bank last year advised India’s Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., along with Rothschild &amp; Co, on the purchase of some of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s assets in the U.K. and Ireland for $770 million. Moelis is ranked 14th globally among merger advisers this year.“The biggest theme that is playing out is domestic consolidation, but it is a more diversified play than earlier,” Girotra said. “It could be fund raising, acquisitions or strategic divestments.”

**‘Won’t criticise govt’ pledge – BJP youth worker’s idea to celebrate PM Modi’s birthday** 

 ______ 
The pledge pamphlet The pledge pamphlet

In the run-up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday on September 17, Prakash Gurjar, a member of BJP Yuva Morcha, has been distributing pamphlets in neighbourhoods across Ahmedabad, asking people to “pledge” that they will not criticise the administration.

Called the ‘Sankalp Patra’, the pamphlets ask people to pledge that “from today, I will throw garbage and dirt in the dustbin, will not dirty my country and not let anyone dirty the country” and “I will not prejudicially criticise the administration that is formed of the people, by the people and for the people”.

“Since 2013, I have been planning events around Narendrabhai’s birthday. Every year, we aim for creating a Guinness World Record. This year, we decided to work on ‘sankalp to siddhi’ and therefore decided to collect at least eight to nine lakh pledges,” Gurjar said.

The process of distributing pamphlets began 10 days ago with Gurjar and his team distributing them outside railway station, malls, theatres, schools and colleges. On Tuesday, a team of 500 people, who are part of Gurjar’s NGO — Madadgar Pariwar Foundation — started collecting forms.

Gurjar, who joined the BJP in 2012 after leaving Congress, said that there was “nothing political” in it. “We wanted to take the Swacch Bharat campaign, launched by the PM, forward, and ask people to appreciate the positive work of the Modi government. We are not forcing people to sign the forms. Many people come to us and ask us, and we explain. After that if they feel comfortable, they agree and sign the pledge,” he said. “There are good politicians in the country and we must praise their work…That is why, I am asking people to pledge that they will not criticize the government in a biased manner,” he added.

In 2013, Gurjar had organised an eye-donation pledge campaign to celebrate Modi’s birthday. He claimed that then too his campaign made it to the Guinness World Record. In 2014, he made a 52-ft tall and 45-ft wide greeting card for Modi. He said that the card was auctioned and the money was sent to Jammu &amp; Kashmir to help the 2014 flood victims. In 2015, Gurjar organised a ‘take selfie with beti’ campaign. Last year, he celebrated Modi’s birthday by forming “human map” of India with the help of 8,500 youngsters.

“I try to make records because it is matter of pride for the country. All of us want to be proud of the country,”said Gurjar, who is a law graduate.

**Centre clears bill to double tax-free gratuity to Rs 20 lakh** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Centre today approved an amendment bill that seeks to double tax-free gratuity for formal sector employees to Rs 20 lakh.""The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval to introduction of the Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2017, in Parliament,"" an official statement said.The amendment will put the maximum limit of gratuity of employees of the private sector as well as public undertakings and autonomous organisations under the government who are not covered under Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, at par with central government employees, which is Rs 20 lakh.The current upper ceiling on gratuity under the Act is Rs 10 lakh. The provisions for central government employees under Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, with regard to gratuity are also similar.Before implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission , the ceiling under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, was Rs 10 lakh. However, post rollout, in the case of government servants, the ceiling stands at Rs 20 lakh, effective January 1, 2016.Considering inflation and wage increase even in the case of employees engaged in the private sector, the government is of the view that the entitlement of gratuity should be revised for employees who are covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.Accordingly, the government initiated the process for amendment to the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, which applies to establishments employing 10 or more persons.The main purpose for enacting this Act is to provide social security to workmen after retirement, whether it is because of rules of superannuation, or physical disablement or impairment of vital parts of the body.Therefore, the Gratuity Act serves as a key social security legislation to wage earners in industries, factories and establishments.

**Dawood Ibrahims properties worth $6.7 billion frozen by British authorities**

Highlights 1 Dawood Ibrahim's properties in UK seized.

2 Dawood has estimated assets worth $6.7 billion in UK.

3 Dawood wanted in 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case.

British authorities have frozen properties belonging to fugitive Indian underworld gangster Dawood Ibrahim. Reports say assets worth $6.7 billion belonging to the wanted underworld don have been seized by British authorities.

Dawood, who Indian agencies claim runs his crime empire from Cliffton area in Karachi, Pakistan, appears on the latest UK Treasury department's Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets, updated last month.

The action against Dawood Ibrahim comes nearly two years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's UK tour. PM Modi, during his November 12-14, 2015 tour, had reportedly handed over a dossier concerning the underworld gangster to his then British counterpart David Cameron.

According to Forbes, Dawood Ibrahim is one of the richest gangsters of all time. In 2015, Forbes estimated Dawood Ibrahim's net asset at US$ 6.7 billion.

Dawood Ibrahim has his business interests in more than a dozen countries spread over Europe, Africa and South Asia. He has assets worth US $450 million in the UK alone. He is said to have invested in over 50 properties in different countries.

Dawood Ibrahim, who is an accused of carrying out 1993-Mumbai bomb blasts, has been named by the UN Security Council's IS and al-Qaida Sanctions Committee as global terrorist.

The UN list has put out 15 aliases of Dawood Ibrahim. These are: Dawood Ebrahim, Sheikh Dawood Hassan, Abdul Hamid Abdul Aziz, Anis Ibrahim, Aziz Dilip, Daud Hasan Shaikh Ibrahim Kaskar, Daud Ibrahim Memon Kaskar, Dawood Hasan Ibrahim Kaskar, Dawood Ibrahim Memon, Dawood Sabri, Kaskar Dawood Hasan, Shaikh Mohd Ismail Abdul Rehman, Dowood Hassan Shaikh Ibrahim, Shaikh Ismail Abdul and Hizrat.

No. It's a reform initiated by the Congress government and long due.

No. India is probably the only Democratic country where Judges appoint Judges, Judges judge Judges, and Judges transfer Judges. The Collegium system is a result of twisted interpretation of the Constitution bordering on abuse.

Independence doesn't mean unaccountability. The SC is notorious for shirking away when when it comes to its own transparency. It was more than happy to pass orders for politicians to disclose their assets, but appeared before the Delhi HC to oppose a similar order by the CIC for SC judges. They also turn a blind eye to corruption in higher judiciary. Worst you get is a transfer to Sikkim HC, as if Sikkim isn't a part of India.

China wants to build high speed rail projects in India, says ""pleased"" to see
Indo-Japan cooperation

**Beijing: **

China on Wednesday showed interest in reviving its proposal to build high
speed railway projects in India which has chosen Japan as a partner for the
country's first such venture.

China has been aggressively marketing its high-speed rail technology abroad
and in the past lobbied hard to get the first contract in India. It had taken
up a feasibility study for the New Delhi-Chennai corridor but no headway has
been made in this regard so far.

The Chinese side showed interest in the projects in India as Prime Minister
Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe prepared to lay the
foundation for India's first bullet train project.

""China is pleased to see the infrastructure among the regional countries
including the high-speed railway,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng
Shuang told a media briefing in Beijing when asked about the Mumbai-Ahmedabad
bullet train project using Japanese technology.

""We stand ready to promote cooperation with India and other regional countries
for regional development,"" Mr Geng said expressing interest in reviving the
project.

""As to the railway cooperation, it is part of the practical cooperation
between India and China. We have reached important consensus in this regard.
Relevant competent authorities between the two countries maintained
communication and increasing speed of railway in the current projects,"" he
said.

India and China have worked out a number of cooperative agreements for the
development of railways under which the Indian Railways engineers are getting
trained in China in heavy hauling.

China is also cooperating with India to set up a rail university. It has also
undertaken work to renovate some of the railway stations in India.

China currently has the world's longest high-speed rail network. It has
connected most of its cities with high speed trains reducing the travel time
drastically.

**What Intel Experts Warned On Rohingyas In Meet At Prime Minister's Office**

Hafiz Saeed addressing Difah-e-Musalman-Arakan Conference in Karachi, Pakistan
in July 2012.

**New Delhi: **

Amid widening international condemnation of India's plans to deport Rohingya
Muslims who have escaped the violence against them in Western Myanmar, top
officials of the government met in the Prime Minister's Office to review their
strategy. The meeting last evening was called by Nripendra Misra, the top aide
to Prime Minister Narendra Modi; the attendees included National Security
Advisor Ajit Doval and the heads of intelligence agencies including the
Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;amp;AW). They focused on increasing alerts about
links between Rohingya militant commanders in Myanmar and terror groups in
Pakistan including Hafiz Saeed's Lashkar-e-Taiba. An intel report reviewed by
them concludes ""In our assessment, penetration of Pakistan-based terrorist
outfits among Rohingya Muslims community is a serious emerging threat, as the
same would ultimately be used for targeting India.""

The meeting was called after

India was named and shamed for its stand on the Rohingyas

at the United Nations top human rights body on Monday by the chief of the
agency.

India's representative offered an arduous rebuttal

, but the timing of yesterday's brain-storming session and the seniority of
those who were present illustrates that the reprimand is a sore point.

Rohingyas.

India says it currently has about 40,000 Rohingyas who have escaped in recent
years from the rising violence against them in Myanmar and entered India
through the north-east border. Most of them are settled in Jammu, Hyderabad
and in and around Delhi. But officials say there has been no great spike in
arrival in India's in the last few weeks. At least 1,25,000 Rohingyas have
fled Myanmar's western state of Rakhine after the military cracked down on
Rohingya insurgents who attacked an army base and dozens of police posts.

The intelligence note reviewed last evening highlights that Rohingya
insurgents in Myanmar have established links to Hafiz Saeed and his Lashkar-e-
Taiba, which is based in Pakistan and is responsible for the 26/11 siege on
Mumbai among other deadly terror attacks in India.

The Lashkar funds and arms Rohingya militants, Indian intelligence agencies
believe. The note attaches photographs that show Hafiz Saeed addressing a
Rohingya militant outfit in Karachi in July 2012. The chief of HuJi, a major
terror network in Pakistan and Bangladesh, is a Pakistani national of Rohingya
origin. Top Pakistani terror group commanders visited a conference organized
in 2012 in Bangladesh by Rohingya militants.

There are other red flags for India: a Pakistani Al Qaeda operative called
Maulana Ustad Wazeer visited Thailand last month to train Rohingya militants.
Intelligence officials are also trying to determine if a Rohingya in Kashmir
was the guide for terrorists who crossed the border last month for a major
attack on a police compound in Pulwama in which eight security personnel were
killed 25 km from Srinagar.

Junior Home Minister Kiren Rijiju today tweeted ""This chorus of branding India
as villain on

Rohingya issue is a calibrated design to tarnish India's image

. It undermines India's security."" The remark appeared to be a response to the
UN's upbraiding earlier this week. And while Mr

Rijiju maintains that the Rohingyas will be deported

, officials who were at last evening's meeting say that's impractical - for
one, they are now a people without a country. ""Where will you deport them?
Myanmar refuses to accept them,"" said one official who attended last night's
meeting, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the discussions.
Another challenge identified was the difficulty in distinguishing between
illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who regularly stream across the porous
border and Rohingyas. ""Even the language is similiar and so many women are
coming, so our border officials cannot be too intrusive,"" an official told
NDTV. The Border Security Force is trying to confine them and persuade them to
return. With little impact. ""The focus is now on increased border patrolling,
however, that's not easy due to the sheer size (of the border region),"" said
officials.

**Government asks 1,222 NGOs to validate bank accounts** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs has asked 1,222 NGOs which received foreign funds to validate their foreign contribution bank accounts or face penal action under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act ( FCRA ), 2010.Some of the organisations which have been warned by MHA through a circular include - Sri Ramakrishna Math, Ramakrishna Mission, Indore Cancer Foundation Charitable Trust, Coimbatore Christian Charitable Trust, Delhi School of Social Work Society, Hindu Anath Ashram, Madani Darut Tarbiyat, Rehmat E Alam Hospital Trust Anantanag, Rotary Club of Mumbai Midwest, JK Trust (Bombay), Goonj, Madina Education and Charitable Society, Nagaland Bible College, Indian Institute for Nature and Environment Study.In its circular, the ministry said all NGOs registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) should receive foreign donations in a single designated bank account.However, it is seen that a number of such organisations have not validated their foreign contribution designated accounts, causing problems for the banks to comply with the FCRA provisions that they (banks) report to the central government within 48 hours of such receipt or utilisation of foreign contribution, the circular read.These associations are required to validate their foreign designated accounts and also the utilisation accounts immediately and send the details, including the bank branch, code, account number, IFSC etc through FC 6 form which is available on https://fcraonline.nic.in, the circular said.""Non-compliance may lead to penal actions as per FCRA 2010 ,"" it said.The centre had sent a notice to the NGOs earlier on updating their bank account.The Modi government, which has tightened the rules for NGOs, has already cancelled registration of more than 10,000 non-governmental organisations in the last three years for alleged non-filing of annual returns as mandated in the FCRA.In addition, renewals of more than 1,300 NGOs have been denied or they were closed in recent past for allegedly violating various provisions of the FCRA.The home ministry has also asked nearly 6,000 NGOs to open their accounts in banks having core banking facilities and furnish details for real-time access to security agencies in case of any discrepancy.The move was initiated after it was detected that many NGOs have their bank accounts in cooperative banks or state government-owned apex banks or banks which do not have core banking facilities.In November, 2016, the government had directed more than 11,000 NGOs to file applications for renewal of registration by February 28, 2017.Of the above, 3,500 NGOs have filed applications for renewal and hence the registration of more than 7,000 NGOs were deemed expired due to non-filing of renewal applications.Currently around 22,000 FCRA registered NGOs are operating in the country.

**Government School Teacher In Madhya Pradesh Suspended For Open Defecation** 

 ______ 
The teacher was posted at a government primary school in Budera village of
Ashoknagar.

**Bhopal: **

The education authorities in Madhya Pradesh have suspended a teacher of a
government school for allegedly defecating in the open.

The education officer of Ashoknagar district issued the suspension order on
Monday, saying open defecation amounted to misconduct and violation of the
government's directives.

The teacher was posted at a government primary school in Budera village of
Ashoknagar.

""In accordance with the directives of the district collector, the education
department has suspended the assistant teacher for open defecation with
immediate effect.He was found violating the government's 'Swachh Bharat
Mission',"" Ashoknagar district's education officer Aditya Narayan Mishra told
PTI today over phone.

Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the teachers are entrusted with the task of
keeping a watch on people who defecate in the open but, on the contrary, this
teacher was himself found defecating in the open despite having a toilet at
his home, he said.

""The employees of Swachh Bharat Mission found the teacher going for open
defecation and a report on the same was submitted to the district collector.
Not abiding by the government's directives regarding Swachh Bharat Mission
amounts to misconduct and violation of the government's directives,"" Mr Mishra
said.

In June this year, the panchayat officials in Virpur village of MP's Raisen
district had imposed a fine of nearly Rs 4 lakh collectively on 13 families
for open defecation.

The Swachh Bharat Mission was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on
October 2, 2014 with the goal of making India clean and free of open
defecation by 2019.

**Babur, Aurangzeb plunderers; history books will be rewritten: UP deputy CM** 

 ______ 
Describing Mughal emperors Babur and Aurangzeb as plunderers who never respected Indian values, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on Tuesday said the history books of the state board will be rewritten by a panel of independent historians.

The deputy chief minister, who holds the secondary and higher education portfolios, said Babur and Aurangzeb just harassed people and committed atrocities, while Bahadur Shah Zafar was a patriot who started the fight for independence, he said.

“That’s why Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited his (Bahadur Shah Zafar’s) tomb in Myanmar recently,” he said.

Sharma was participating in the Safaigiri awards of a Delhi-based media house in Lucknow.

Asserting that the cruelty of Akbar would not be part of Indian history, he declared his “good side with Birbal” will be put in the books.

He said , “Till now Europeans, Turks, Moghuls, French, Chinese and Communists have written Indian history but now the things have changed. A panel of historians will be formed to rewrite history as most of the Indian greats have been shown in a poor light in the past.”

Claiming that icons like Guru Teg Bahadur, Maharana Pratap, Guru Govind Singh and Shivaji, were shown as dacoits in textbooks, he said such things would be changed.

“We must learn to respect our ancestors. We do not carry the legacy of invaders but we carry the legacy of Lord Ram, Krishna, Guru Nanak, Mahavir, Gautam Buddha , Guru Govind Singh and Shivaji. We will have to study more about them, not about invaders,” he said.

To a question on the Taj Mahal, he said, “The Taj Mahal is an outstanding monument depicting Indian craftsmanship but Shahjahan amputated the hands of artisans who made the Taj. This is not Indian culture and shows he was barbaric. He created a feeling of panic among artisans and engineers who could not gather the courage to build more such monuments.”

**DUSU election 2017: NSUI deals ABVP a blow, wins top posts; Congress says wake-up call for PM Modi** 

 ______ 
It is two-two for Delhi University’s campus rivals in the student union elections but the Congress-backed National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) wrested the advantage winning the posts of president and vice president on Wednesday.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) won the posts of secretary and joint secretary in the hotly contested polls. The RSS-affiliated association had three posts in the outgoing panel.

The results signalled a comeback for the NSUI, which held the president’s position in the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) five years ago.

The Congress’s student wing had bagged three in 2012 and swept all four posts in 2007.

The results, declared a day after the vote, were marred by controversy as officials announced initially that NSUI won three seats but corrected later that the ABVP took the joint secretary’s post.

'Youth for Change' sweeps Delhi University.

Wake up call for PM Modi. Young demand employment, opportunities &amp; freedom. — Randeep S Surjewala (@rssurjewala) September 13, 2017

Congratulations @nsui on an outstanding performance in #DUSUelection2017. A triumph for liberal values on campus. #NSUIwinsDU Proud of you! — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) September 13, 2017

The NSUI vowed to challenge the outcome for this position in the Delhi high court.

Chief election officer SB Babbar said the NSUI complaint will be forward to the grievance cell.

The new panel comprises Rocky Tuseed and Kunal Sehrawat of the NSUI as president and vice president, and the ABVP’s Mahamedhaa Nagar and Uma Shankar as secretary and joint secretary.

The winning margins of Sehrawat and Shankar were 175 and 342 votes in the elections that recorded a 42.8% turnout.

Wednesday’s outcome is a morale-booster for the NSUI after the group suffered a humiliating defeat in the Jawaharlal Nehru student union elections on September 8. An umbrella of left-leaning unions swept the polls. The ABVP came second and the NSUI registered less votes than the “none of the above” or Nota option.

Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Randeep Surjewala hailed the Delhi University victory as “a triumph of liberal values and wake-up call for Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.

Party vice president Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Congratulations @nsui on a stellar performance &amp; Pres win in DUSU! Thank students of DU for reposing faith in Congress ideology (sic.).”

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) countered that the defeat in the student union elections cannot be an indicator of the party’s popularity graph.

Congratulations @NSUI

Won 3 out of 4 seats in DUSU including President — Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken) September 13, 2017

Ravinder Gupta, general secretary of the BJP’s Delhi unit, said the university elections are not a mandate against the Modi government or the party.

“Student union elections do not decide national politics. I do not find any political reason behind ABVP’s defeat in two seats,” said Gupta, who was the association’s campaign manager.

Delhi unit BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and general secretary Siddharthan held several meetings with students ahead of Tuesday’s polls.

“A few thousand students cannot reflect the mood of the city or nation for that matter. The Congress has lost its support, it is a fact. Winning student union elections don’t mean the party has made a comeback,” Gupta said.

**View: Don’t join hypocrites in condemning Myanmar** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Myanmar visit (September 5-7) was timely for consolidating bilateral ties. More so as Modi could give political comfort to the Aung San Suu Kyi government on the Rohingya issue over which she is being personally castigated internationally. Voices for restoration of sanctions on Myanmar are being heard.We should not fritter away our strategic stakes in Myanmar by joining a selective, hypocritical chorus on humanitarian issues by those who prefer to agitate only such as are low-cost for them. The Islamic countries who condemn Myanmar should explain why Saudi Arabia’s onslaught on the Yemenis or that of Turkey on the Kurds is overlooked by them. Why is there silence on China’s treatment of Tibetans and the Uighur Muslims ? The OIC liberally condemns India on Kashmir but is inaudible over Pakistan’s promotion of terrorism in India and Afghanistan. The ease with which the perceived maltreatment of Muslims anywhere mobilises the community in distant geographies, even violently, explains why pan-Islamism makes the full integration of Muslim minorities in non-Muslim countries difficult.Unfortunately, humanitarian issues are viewed by Islamic countries primarily through the religious prism. Myanmar may be mishandling the Rohingya issue but its complexity should not be downplayed by critics. Myanmar is strategically important for us for multiple reasons. It is contiguous with our insurgency-prone and economically underdeveloped northeast region. We need Myanmar’s cooperation to deal with insurgent groups and partner in connectivity projects that would link this land-locked region to the Bay of Bengal and beyond to ASEAN.This would aid in developing our northeast states and contribute to their better integration with the rest of India by removing a feeling of neglect. Our Act East policy has the strategic objective of building closer ties with the economically dynamic Asian countries with which we have had intimate civilisational ties historically. The contemporary challenge is to redress the power balance in the region that is shifting towards a China fired by hegemonic ambitions. China is building north-south connectivities to link the region to the Chinese economy and through this gain political ascendancy.India is promoting east-west connectivity projects such as the trilateral India-Myanmar-Thailand highway to be extended eventually to Vietnam. Myanmar is our gateway for such projects. China has also positioned itself very strongly in Myanmar itself, gaining access to the Bay of Bengal through its pipelines and port projects as part of its maritime silk road strategy. We have to offset China’s power in Myanmar, particularly with growing Myanmarese resistance to Beijing’s tightening embrace. The Rohingya issue should not be given the colour of a bilateral one between India and Bangladesh.Commentary that India’s stance will damage India-Bangladesh relations as it fails to recompense the Sheikh Hasina government for its cooperation on weeding out anti-India insurgents from its soil is misguided. Bangladesh’s biggest defence partner is China, it supports the Belt and Road Initiative and wants to put its China and India ties in separate boxes. India has let the issue of 20 million plus Bangladeshi illegal migrants in India lie dormant, though the fact that 40,000 Rohingyas have moved to India should be reason for India to seriously address the porosity of our border with Bangladesh.Astonishingly, the Rohingyas by the thousands have settled down in J&amp;K where the Muslims fiercely oppose the settlement of Hindu refugees as a conspiracy to bring about demographic change. The Rohingya issue is thorny for us and glib talk about India’s historical vocation to accept refugees from everywhere is altogether vaporous.(The author is a former foreign secretary)

**DUSU results 2017: Rahul Gandhi's US speech helped NSUI win, says Delhi Congress** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress on Wednesday said the US speech of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi helped Congress's student wing National Students Union of India (NSUI) make a stunning comeback in the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) polls the results of which were counted on Wednesday. The students who voted in the DUSU polls had access to Rahul Gandhi's speech through social media and television channels before voting took place for DUSU polls Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken said: ""The students listened to the address of PM Narendra Modi on September 11 and Rahul Gandhi's speech on September 12 and reacted (through voting). Rahul Gandhi's speech clicked with the students and they did not like Modi's speech. The students were impressed with Rahul Gandhi's speech and voted for NSUI."" Modi addressed a gathering of students on the 125th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda's Chicago address on Monday.NSUI won the elections for the posts of president and vice president on Wednesday, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) lost the posts of president and vice president after four years. NSUI's Rocky Tuseed won the president's post defeating ABVP's Rajat Choudhary while Kunal Sehrawat won the post of vice president. ABVP has won the post of secretary and joint secretary.""The students made definite comparison of the two speeches and students then voted for NSUI and Congress,"" Maken said.Maken, who was a Union minister during UPA government, rejected the wide criticism of Rahul Gandhi's views on dynastic politics made at the University of California, Berkeley on Tuesday. ""The section of social media where criticism of the speech was made, as Rahul Gandhi himself said, is controlled by 1000 people behind the computer screens. They are managed by the person who is supposed to manage the country. That is something the students understood pretty well and they have answered it,"" Maken told TOI.In his speech Rahul Gandhi defended the charge of being a dynast and said that this was true of other parties as well and this is how India runs. BJP accused Rahul Gandhi of being a ""failed dynast"".Claiming that the DUSU results were tampered with the intervention of Centre and BJP, Maken said that Congress will move high court against it.""NSUI had won three of the four seats, including the post of joint secretary. ABVP sought re-election for the post of joint secretary and soon its candidate was declared winner. It was a well-planned exercise to defeat NSUI,"" Maken said at a press conference. NSUI has lodged a complaint with DUSU election office in this regard.Maken alleged that the CCTV cameras were not working when the recounting of votes was done for the post of joint secretary.He said that always DUSU elections have been held on Friday-Saturday so that the counting is done on Sunday and the classes are not disturbed. ""The elections were smartly postponed for September 12, a day after the PM makes his speech. It was a conspiracy to take undue advantage in the elections. The students have rejected the speech of PM,"" Maken said.

**India-Japan business ties are at an all-time high**

New Delhi: R .C. Bhargava, chairman of India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, fondly recounts meetings between business delegates from India and Japan over lunch with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe during their visits to India and Japan.

“Such gestures gave a lot of importance to the business communities of both the countries,” said Bhargava, who is a member of the India-Japan business forum. “In those meetings, both the leaders met all the delegates individually and listened to their issues.”

Bhargava was instrumental in forging a joint venture between the then Maruti Udyog Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp. in 1983 when the Indian government wanted to build a people’s car —Maruti 800.

He thinks relations between the countries are now warmer than ever. “Earlier, I don’t think there was the same level of closeness, even during the regime of Dr. Manmohan Singh and his Japanese counterpart. It is a very high point for India and Japan,” he added.

Foreign direct investments (FDI) from Japanese companies in India put Bhargava’s observations in perspective. FDI from Japan, which was at $150 million in 2000-01, reached $5.5 billion in 2007 because Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd acquired Ranbaxy Laboratories. Japanese investments started to decelerate in the following years and stood at $1.71 billion in 2013-14, shortly before Modi took over as prime minister. But after that, there has been a phenomenal surge. At the end of 2016-17, FDI inflow from Japan rose 80% to $4.7 billion from a year earlier, according to data provided by the Indian embassy in Tokyo.

The number of Japanese firms in India has been rising in recent years. As of October 2016, there were 1,305 Japanese firms registered in India, an increase of 76 (6%) from 2015. These companies had 4,590 business establishments operating in India, an increase of 173 or (3%) from 2015.

Despite the increase, Japanese FDI in India remains small compared to Japan’s total outward FDI. In terms of cumulative FDI inflows into India, Japan is now India’s third largest source.

According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), as much as 48% of Japanese investment has gone into the auto sector and the rest in sectors such as metals, financial services, chemicals, transport, chemical and information technology.

Bharat Kaushal, managing director of Hitachi India and former chairman of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC), is bullish. “Over the years, economic engagement has transitioned from G2G (government to government) to more cross border inorganic engagement of part stake and full stake. The private sector in Japan is keen to invest in a growing economy like India, and these investments are already 13-14% by volume. This is a good opportunity for India to leverage Japanese technology to move up in the value chain of industrial and digital activity,” Kaushal said.

According to a CII presentation, which Mint has reviewed, as many as 15 large Japanese firms plan to enter India. These include Sojitz Corp., Tokyo Century Lease and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

CII looks at Japan as a “potential hub for investment promotion” and it is aiming at “Japanese companies for investment in India”.

“Japanese investment in India is growing but I am not sure how much of this investment is in manufacturing as such. It has come into IT and pharma, how much has come into manufacturing... I am not sure. Suzuki’s investment is only such known thing in manufacturing,” Bhargava summed up.

**READ: Ahmedabad To Mumbai In 2 Hours: 10 Points On India's First Bullet Train**

  * The foundation stone-laying ceremony at the Sabarmati railway station is PM Abe's first official engagement since he landed to a grand reception on Wednesday afternoon. The two leaders have been together in informal settings since then and will hold summit meetings after the bullet train function.
  * The project will cost Rs. 1.10 lakh crore. Japan will fund 81 per cent of the entire project, nearly Rs. 88,000 crores, in soft loans at an interest rate of 0.1%. The loan will have to be repaid over 50 years.
  * A joint venture between the Indian Railways and the Japanese firm Shinkansen Technology, the Japanese side estimates the first bullet train will roll out only by 2023.
  * New Railways Minister Piyush Goyal says PM Modi wants the train to start a year ahead of schedule - on 15 August 2022 - when India completes 75 years of independence.

_(video provided by NDTV)_

  * The new train will race between PM Modi's home state Gujarat and Mumbai, the financial capital carrying 750 passengers. It can make 70 Ahmedabad-Mumbai trips in a day.
  * It is expected to run on an average speed of 250 km per hour, with a top speed of around 320 km per hour - more than double the top speed of the fastest train in India.
  * The travel time will be reduced from eight hours to a little over three hours if it stops at all the 12 stations and around two hours if it stops at only four.
  * Of the 508-km stretch, 92 per cent of the route will be elevated, six per cent through a tunnel and the rest on the ground. The high speed train will pass through the country's longest tunnel of 21 km, of which seven km will be under sea.
  * But the Maharashtra government is still iffy on where the bullet train will end in Mumbai. The state government this week agreed to spare 9,000 sq metres plot for the station at Bandra-Kurla Complex on the condition that the railways assess suitability of an alternative site.
  * A greater stretch of this link, 351 km, will run through Gujarat and 156 km through Maharashtra.

**Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe meet today: 5 things to watch out for** 

 ______

Ahmedabad/Gandhingar: After a day filled with gestures of friendship and bonhomie underlining the warmth in ties between India and Japan, the prime ministers of the two countries are to sit down for formal talks on Thursday and discuss ways to strengthen the India-Japan partnership both in the bilateral context and beyond.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who arrived in Gujarat’s commercial capital Ahmedabad on Wednesday, is in India for the 12th India-Japan annual summit.

India and Japan decided to institutionalise bilateral summits between their prime ministers during a visit by Abe to India in 2006. Russia is the only country other than Japan with which India has such an arrangement of annual summits, said Srikanth Kondapalli, a professor of international relations at New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University. This is also the fourth annual summit since Modi took office in 2014.

The two countries are expected to come up with a joint statement that will outline their priorities over next year and beyond.

Also read: Five challenges in the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project

One of the first engagements of Abe and Modi on Thursday will be the launch of the high-speed railway corridor from Sabarmati station near Ahmedabad. The inauguration of the project will mark the entry of Japan into what is seen as a key Asian market ahead of competitors like China and several European countries like Germany and even Spain.

Here’s a look at some of the issues to watch out for on Thursday.

■ Modi and Abe are expected to participate in the inauguration of Japan Industrial Parks I and II, which are expected to come up on the Mandal-Becharaji and Khoraj-Sanand stretches in Gujarat. About 15-20 Japanese companies have shown interest in investing in Gujarat, which has already attracted $1.1 billion in investments from Japan, according to several estimates. This will give a boost to manufacturing in India as well as increase the level of Japanese investments in Asia’s third largest economy.

■ Japan could press India to improve its investment climate for Japanese companies. This is despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing the launch of a “Japan window” under his office three years ago to promote Japanese investments in the country. Kondapalli pointed out that despite India and Japan enjoying close and cordial political relations, economic ties between the two countries remained far below potential. This is in contrast to China with which Japan has uneasy political ties but robust economic relations, he said. Bilateral trade between India and Japan too has stagnated around the $16 billion mark.

■ The two countries are expected to announce the launch of the Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), regarded as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which seeks to connect China by land and sea to Southeast, South and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa. India and Japan could commit about $40 billion initially to the proposed growth corridor that envisages capacity building and human resource development in Africa, creating quality infrastructure and institutional connectivity, people-to-people partnership, and development and cooperation projects.

■ India and Japan could also firm up plans to improve cooperation on the Chabahar port project in Iran. India is looking to develop the Chabahar port as an alternative access route to landlocked Afghanistan given that Pakistan is unwilling to give India access to a road through its territory to reach Afghanistan. During the 11th India-Japan annual summit last year in Tokyo, Modi and Abe had called for discussions to facilitate Japan’s involvement in Chabahar. India, Iran and Afghanistan signed a trilateral agreement last year in May for establishing transport and transit corridors for the strategically located port in Iran.

■ Given that India and Japan have testy relations with China, the India-Japan joint statement could contain language signalling a closer partnership—may be even an alliance—between India and Japan, Kondapalli said. Abe’s current visit comes against the backdrop of North Korea’s sixth nuclear test on 3 September and India announcing the end of a tense military confrontation with China on 28 August. China is seen as the main backer of North Korea as well as India’s arch rival Pakistan. Japan also has concerns about China’s claims over Senkaku Islands, said Kondapalli, referring to some uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. Given these, India and Japan could come up with a section in the joint statement suggestive of an alliance, Kondapalli said. Defence ties could also get a fillip if the two sides announce any decision on India buying two US amphibious aircraft from Japan.

GUWAHATI: A few Congress members on Wednesday staged a walkout from the assembly after speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami refused legislators Sherman Ali Ahmed and Jakir Hussain Sikdar to raise an adjournment motion on the plight of Rohingyas Thousands of Rohingyas, minority Muslims in the Rakhine state of of Myanmar, are fleeing their country after being caught in a violent ethnic conflict. The issue came up at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a visit to Myanmar.Human rights organisations want the Prime Minister to urge the Myanmar government to address the problem. With the northeast sharing a 1643-km-long international border with Myanmar, the exodus of Rohingyas has also become an issue in the region.Thousands of displaced Rohingyas had also entered Bangladesh where the shelter camps are already overcrowded. In the assembly, both Ahmed and Sikdar of Congress gave notice for an adjournment motion to discuss the Rohingya issue. The speaker, however, did not allow them to raise the issue on Rohingyas, saying the assembly was not the forum to discuss the matter.Even as Ahmed insisted on raising the issue, Goswami said his ruling was final and asked him to allow the proceedings of the house. Later, Congress legislator Abdul Khaleque staged a walkout saying that it was in protest against the speaker's decision. Other Congress MLAs also followed suit. But other party legislators, including Rakibul Hussain, Rekibuddin Ahmed and Nazrul Islam, remained seated for some time.

**Bullet train project: 'This shows the aspirations of new India, one that is flying high', says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the bullet train project he and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for on Thursday ""will add speed to India's growth"", ""shorten the distance between people and places"" and ""increase productivity thanks to high speed connectivity"".Both Abe and Modi said after they laid the foundation stone for the high speed rail between Ahmedabad and Mumbai that the project will be a huge boost for the 'Make in India' goal, something both India and Japan are committed to.The two leaders traded fulsome compliments, committed to retain, renew and grow their friendship and make the India-Japan partnership a globally strategic and relevant one.""This project exemplifies a new India and is an expression of its dreams, its flight is limitless, its aspirations infinite, it's an India that is flying high,"" said PM Modi after the foundation stone laying ceremony in Ahmedabad.Abe was equally enthusiastic about the project.""I hope to enjoy the beauty of India through the windows of the bullet train when I come to India in a few years,"" said Japan's PM.PM Modi effusively thanked Abe and Japan.""A good friend is timeless and sees no borders. Japan has shown it is this kind of friend. We are able to get this project off the ground so quickly and the credit for that goes to Abe, he took a personal interest in it to ensure there are no delays or difficulties,"" said Modi.He added that Japan is the kind of friend who ""gave a loan of Rs 88,000 crore on an interest of only 0.1%"" for the project.Abe repeated how important India is as a partner for Japan.""If we work together nothing is impossible. I would like to state that India-Japan partnership is special, strategic and global,"" he said.PM Modi said that apart from economic and cultural growth, the bullet train project will boost the 'Make in India' platform.""For this high speed rail project, the technology may well be coming from Japan, but the moving parts, the manufacturing will all be from India,"" he said.Abe said Japan is in fact making a special commitment to give manufacturing a boost in India.""Japan is committed to the scheme of 'Make in India'. Our industries are working with India to give a boost to manufacturing in India,"" said Abe.Both leaders earlier also laid the foundation stone for an institute that will come up at Vadodara where around 4,000 people will be trained for the bullet train project. Railway minister Piyush Goyal , Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and his Maharashtra counterpart Devendra Fadnavis were present on the occasion.The Rs 1.10 lakh crore train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai is expected to be completed by 2022. The train will cover the distance of over 500 km in around two hours. The project is a joint venture between Indian Railways and Japan's Shinkansen Technology.

**What Japan And India Both Gain From New Bullet Train** 

 ______ 
Japan's government and its rail companies lobbied the U.S. for years to sell
their bullet-train technology and found little success. Finally, there's an
international buyer: India.

India is poised to become the first to import the iconic 'Shinkansen' bullet-
train technology after Japan's near-neighbor Taiwan, and that will be a
highlight of India's infrastructure upgrade program. The Japanese government
has also agreed to fund most of the $17 billion needed for the project that
will become part of Asia's oldest railway network.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japan's Shinzo Abe formally
kicked off a plan to build the 316-mile bullet train line -- roughly the
distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Financing by Japan also means
business farmed out to companies such as Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.,
Hitachi Ltd. and East Japan Railway Co. and an opportunity lost for China's
CRRC Corp Ltd. and European manufacturers including Alstom SA.

For Japan, which is locked in a strategic rivalry with China for commercial
contracts abroad, the Indian project marks a hard-fought victory as companies
including Siemens AG, Bombardier Inc., Alstom and, lately, CRRC compete in a
global market projected by BCC Research to be worth about $133 billion by
2019. After building the world's largest high-speed network since the start of
the century, covering 80 percent of its major cities, China has been raising
its profile.

""The competition between China and Japan, especially in the ASEAN region, has
been fairly intense and in India, there will be more competition for other
phases of the bullet train project,"" said Jaideep Ghosh, partner and head of
transport at consultancy KPMG. ""Japan has a longer history of operating the
system without any fatalities. Politics and strategic considerations do play a
part, but finally it is a commercial decision.""

**Trump Campaign**

India isn't the only country in Asia that is offering potential in high-speed
rail. China outbid Japan to win a $5.5 billion project in Indonesia in 2015,
while the two countries are poised for a face-off again over a proposed
Singapore-Kuala Lumpur link scheduled for completion by 2026.

President Donald Trump campaigned for improving infrastructure during
elections. In February, ahead of a meeting with Abe, Trump even talked about
high-speed railway lines. Trump told airline bosses that Japan and China ""have
fast trains all over the place. We don't have one,"" according to a transcript
of a meeting he had with airline chiefs.

In 2010, Japan had offered to build high-speed rail in California as part of a
$40 billion project after discussions with then Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger. In 2014, Abe said his government may provide financing to
support Central Japan Railway Co.'s bid to provide maglev trains for a
Washington-Baltimore line.

A bullet train on Indian soil is part of PM Modi's ambitious plan to modernize
rail infrastructure after decades of underinvestment. He is pouring as much as
8.6 trillion rupees ($134 billion) to upgrade the congested and aging lines
that daily carry the equivalent of Australia's population. The network was
started under British colonial rule 164 years ago.

**Soft Loan**

PM Modi and Japan's PM Abe unveiled a plaque at Sabarmati in Gujarat to mark
the inauguration of the project linking the financial capital of Mumbai with
the economic hub of Ahmedabad. The Japanese government is financing 81 percent
of the cost, with a $13.8 billion soft yen-loan carrying an interest rate of
0.1 percent.

Kawasaki Heavy and India's Bharat Heavy Electrics Ltd. will collaborate on the
rolling stock, Abe said Thursday at the event. Bharat Heavy rose as much as
10.2 percent in Mumbai, the biggest intraday gain in a year.

PM Modi is also counting on the project to spur a manufacturing and employment
boom. His government says it will create 20,000 construction jobs, apart from
4,000 direct and 20,000 indirect jobs for operations. Local companies such as
Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Ltd., Gammon India Ltd. and GMR Infrastructure Ltd. are
also looking to win some of the contracts.

""We may be getting the technology from Japan, but most of the components for
the bullet train will be sourced from India,"" PM Modi said in a speech at the
event. ""That's why our industry will have to manufacture world-class
equipment, supply them on time, focus on zero-defect manufacturing.""

Japan has pitched quality as the primary selling point to India -- a network
that boasts zero fatal accidents in its more than half-century of history.
Japan's relatively high initial costs can be offset by lower repair expenses
over a lifespan of decades, Japanese officials have said.

**Possibly Six More**

""We will work closely with the Japanese government and JR East to actively
respond to the introduction of the Shinkansen system to India,"" Hitachi
spokesman Tatsuya Moriki said. JR East would like to contribute to the success
of the project, spokesman Kengo Shikanai said.

A representative for CRRC didn't respond to a request for comments, while an
Alstom spokeswoman declined to comment.

India is reviewing prospects for at least six more potential bullet-train
corridors, including one that would connect Mumbai to New Delhi, although no
decision has been taken. India has said it is in talks with Japan and other
countries for those projects.

**Highlights of the project:**

The official target for completion is 2023. India says it will attempt to have
it running a year earlier Total estimated cost is 1.08 trillion rupees While
the train is designed to run at 350 kmph, it will operate at a maximum speed
of 320 kmph, cutting down travel time between the two cities to about two
hours from eight hours Most of the corridor will be elevated, but will include
a 21-kilometer tunnel with seven kilometers under the Arabian Sea

**PM Modi on cost of bullet train project: ‘In a way it is free’**

(Source: PTI Photo)

“More productivity with high-speed connectivity” is what India will gain from the bullet train, which the country is getting “as good as free of cost”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday inaugurating the start of the prestigious project near the Sabarmati river.

With visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by his side near the site for the proposed Sabarmati station of the 508-km Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor, Modi said that Japan’s loan for the project is on such easy terms that it is free of cost.

“Ek prakar se muft mein (In a way it is free),” Modi said reminding that the project was made possible thanks to the Japanese loan of Rs 88,000 crore at an attractive 0.1 per cent interest to be repaid over 50 years. “In Shinzo Abe, India has found a friend no bank in the world could match,” Modi said. Japan is financing 81 per cent of the Rs 1.08 lakh crore project through the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

“It is my wish that when India celebrates 75 years of Independence in 2022-23, Abe and I together travel in this train,” he said echoing Abe who had said in his address that he would like to come to Gujarat by the bullet train the next time he visits the state.

Abe and Modi pressed a remote control button from the dais to unveil the foundation stone even as a crane and a few workers were shown on screen starting the symbolic ground-breaking at the project site in Vadodara. A staff training centre will also come up at the site.

The high-speed rail project was conceived over 10 years ago on paper, but picked up speed only three years ago as the UPA government could never decide to go full throttle on this project which was always considered too expensive for India.

Political observers are also calling the bullet train function with Abe in Ahemdabad as the unofficial start to the BJP’s election campaign for the state polls due this year.

“The next generation economic growth will take place along high speed railways. Our stress is more productivity with high speed connectivity. This project will not only bring Mumbai and Ahmedabad closer, but the entire stretch can develop as a single economic corridor,” Modi said. “The time for slow growth is over.”

The bullet train’s official completion date is late 2023, which the government is trying to advance by about a year to coincide with 75 years of India’s independence. “If India and Japan decide, I am sure it can be done a year in advance,” he said.

Modi said that the high-speed rail corridor should be viewed in the context of overall economic development.

“Considering the time it takes to reach the airport and then take a flight and ultimately reach the destination in the city, the bullet train will take half the time for people to reach. Think of the time saved, the ‘thousands’ of vehicles that may go off road between Mumbai and Ahmedabad,” Modi said. And as a ripple effect, less cars and buses would mean less consumption of fuel, which in turn means savings in foreign currency to import fuel, he said. The bullet train will take at least 2.07 hours to cover the distance at a maximum speed of 350 km per hour and four halts. More halts will marginally increase the travel time, but never exceeding the overall journey to more than three hours.

Modi also indicated that the fares of the bullet train might be within reach of the common man. “Usually, new technology comes for an elite class of select few. Our aim is to make modern technology affordable for the poor and the common man. Now that we are infusing new, modern technology in Railways, we should ensure that the common man benefits from this new technology,” he said.

The Prime Minister said the high speed rail corridor and other developments in rail sector like doubling of lines and the Dedicated Freight Corridor were all part of the larger plan for economic growth through robust transport infrastructure. “Highways are being built, 106 waterways are being developed for carriage of goods, and now the aviation sector is trowing up new possibilities. In the past three year, the number of domestic fliers has increased by around three crores. We now also have a national aviation policy,” he said adding that post GST economic activities have seen a 30 per cent increase already.

In his address, Abe called Modi “my good friend” and wished to take the bullet train along with Modi when it completes. “My good friend Modiji has taken a decision (to build the bullet train). We have decided to totally support this decision of Modiji,” he said. Taking a leaf out of Modi’s style of inventing acronyms, Abe said if you join Japan’s ‘Ja’ and India ‘I’, it becomes “Jai”, or victory in Hindi. “Our friendship with India has developed into a strategic and global partnership”.

Abe said that the Japanese bullet train Shinkansen– the Indian bullet train will be its modern version — brought in economic development in post-World War Japan. “After the World War, Japan had become a land of burnt fields. With the advent of the Shinkansen in 1964 distances bridged, Japanese society transport with new jobs, lifestyle and economic activities, and Japan entered the 10-per-cent-plus GDP growth,” he said.

**After BRICS, India-Japan joint statement names Pakistan-based terror groups Lashkar, Jaish** 

 ______ 
Modi

NEW DELHI: India and Japan on Thursday called for a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to terrorism and committed to cooperate in the fight against terror, including the Pakistan-based groups Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed ( JeM ).In what appeared to be a reference to Pakistan , the two Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe , in their joint statement, called upon all countries to work towards rooting out terrorist safe havens and infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels and halting cross-border movement of terrorists.When it came to the issue of perpetrators of terror attacks, including the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot strikes, the two leaders didn't shy away from naming Pakistan, and called upon it to bring to justice those who carried out the attacks.""PM (Narendra Modi and PM (Shinzo) Abe look forward to convening (the) 5th Japan-India consultation on terrorism and to strengthen cooperation against terrorists threats from groups including Al-Qaida, ISIS, JeM, LeT and their affiliates,"" said the two countries in a joint statement at the end of Abe's 2-day visit to India.Modi and Abe condemned in the ""strongest terms"" the growing menace of terrorism and violent extremism, their statement added.""They shared the view that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is a global scourge that must be forcefully combated through concerted global action in the spirit of 'zero tolerance',"" the joint document saidand Abe called upon all UN member countries to implement UNSC resolution 1267 and other relevant resolutions dealing with the designation of terrorist entities, the statement said.New Delhi has had success lately in getting Pakistan-based terror named and shamed at international forums.Earlier this month, for the first time, BRICS countries slammed Pakistan without naming it, as they ""deplored"" terror attacks in member countries and the ""violence caused"" by Pakistan-based terror outfits.The 'BRICS Xiamen Declaration' specifically named LeT and JeM, as well as the Haqqani network, the Taliban, ISIL/DAISH and Al-Qaida.In addition, the BRICS members also called for greater efficiency in designation of terrorists. This was particularly significant, because it is BRICS member China that has been blocking designating Jaish-e-Muhammad chief Masood Azhar a terrorist. That may now change, in a further setback for JeM.Pakistan has been at the receiving end lately on the terror issue.Last month, US President Donald Trump roundly criticised it for ""hosting terror safe havens"". He also threatened to suspend aid unless Pakistan falls in line and cracks down on terror, which Trump said it is exporting to the region, including to Afghanistan.

**India’s exports to Japan halve to $3.85 billion in four years**

New Delhi: Amid growing bonhomie between Japan and India —Asia’s second and third largest economy, respectively—lies the dark reality that in just four years, Indian exports to Japan have almost halved to $3.85 billion in 2016-17, from $6.81 billion in 2013-14.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is currently on a two-day state visit to India and aims to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries. Abe was received by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad.

The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed by India and Japan in February 2011 and implemented from August 2011 was expected to boost bilateral trade in goods and services. However, India’s merchandise exports started contracting in four out of five years between 2012-13 and 2016-17. As a result, India’s trade deficit with Japan has now widened to $5.9 billion against $2.7 billion in 2013-14. In 2016-17, India’s exports to Japan contracted 17.5%, and its imports fell by 1%.

Commerce ministry analysis of data for the period 2009-10 to 2013-14 indicates that preferential imports under the CEPA still form a small proportion of total imports. In 2013-14, it stood at 22.4% of total imports under the India-Japan CEPA.

“The negative or slow growth in trade with Japan is a matter of concern for India, in view of the fact that there is high potential for faster progress on goods and services trade,” the Indian embassy in Tokyo says on its website.

Even the foreign trade policy statement 2015-20 released by the commerce ministry alludes to non-tariff barriers faced by Indian exporters. “While on the one hand, the Japanese market has not seen growth in the product areas of India’s interest, Indian business entities are facing problems in market access. These problems can be briefly said to be arising out of language constraints faced by Indian companies in Japan, highly demanding product and service standards, regulations that require business modalities making market access a costly venture, and a relative lack of intensive effort on the part of Indian business,” it said.

“The other route of access of India’s export sectors into Japan will require language proficiency, negotiating a simplified framework for market access and continuous trade promotion efforts on the part of businesses and the government,” it added.

India’s primary exports to Japan have been petroleum products, chemical elements, fish and fish preparation, non-metallic mineral ware, metalliferous ores and scrap, clothing and accessories, iron and steel products, textile yarn/fabrics, machinery, feeding-stuff for animals.

India’s primary imports from Japan are machinery, iron and steel products, electrical machinery, transport equipment, chemical elements, plastic materials, manufactures of metals, precision instruments, rubber manufactured, coal and briquettes.

Bilateral trade in services between India and Japan also remains subdued. India’s exports of IT and IT enabled services to Japan account for less than 1% of Japan’s IT services market and India also has an overall trade deficit in services with Japan unlike the surplus position it has with many developed countries.

“The CEPA sub-committee on services could take up several implementation issues including those relating to expeditious issue of visas for IT and other service providers, clarification of ‘technology services’ in the bilateral double taxation agreement, regulatory issues relating to financial services, particularly insurance and progress on the built-in agenda in CEPA including in respect of nurses and healthcare workers and mutual recognition agreements among professional bodies,” said a study of India-Japan trade published by New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for developing countries.

Pravakar Sahoo, professor at the Institute of Economic Growth, said the CEPA has been a failure when it came to boosting India’s exports to Japan. “Since tariff lines of Japan were already close to zero, it is India who gave more market access to Japan through significant tariff cuts,” he said.

However, Sahoo said Japan has very strict quality controls and Indian exporters need to comply with those regulations to increase exports to this lucrative market.

The commerce ministry plans to run special programmes for trade promotion in Japan in identified sectors like textiles, garments, information technology services, pharmaceuticals, leather products and agro-processed products, according to the FTP statement. Biswajit Dhar, professor of economics in the Jawaharlal Nehru University, said India should look at higher investment from Japanese companies along the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor.

“Building of the DMIC which has been languishing for years needs to be fast-tracked. Industries along the corridor could help us boost investment led exports,” he added.

Construction of anything creates job. Doesn't need to be a bullet train. They could have constructed a new airport terminal.

Many planes can fly in one day and multiple times a day. Cheaper and faster, both at the same time.

As far as number of passengers is concerned, it's irrelevant unless the price of plane tickets is less than the price of bullet train tickets.

&gt;Plane tickets are cheap,yes, but plane doesn't stop in between,does it? Bullet will have 12 stops in between.

12 stops? Is it a bullet train or a passenger train? 

Don't know where you got that number from but let's run with it. So you're telling me that there are people living in smaller cities between Mumbai and Ahmedabad who will pay a premium and travel in bullet trains? My god, you've lost your mind. Indians don't have that kind of purchase power. And even if somebody does, they would most definitely appreciate it more if cheaper trains are run on time and don't derail like a clockwork every 2 days.

Bullet trains is nothing but a vanity project for Modi. I'd be happier for the *desh* when that 1 lakh crore loan was for education or healthcare.

Our educational system should be revamped so as to help enhance the face-to-face social interactions of teenagers. Photo: iStockphoto

The news about the tragic deaths of infants in Gorakhpur and Nashik hospitals shocked everyone and forced the government machinery to step in on an emergency basis. At the same time, news reports of youngsters committing suicide for various reasons are a daily feature in newspapers. Although on the surface, the causes of these two sets of deaths appear different, on closer inspection, they seem to emanate from a common cause.

The immediate cause for deaths in Gorakhpur hospitals is attributed to non-availability of oxygen cylinders. Looking back on a temporal scale for the reasons for the non-availability of oxygen cylinders in Gorakhpur, one sees a much larger problem: decades of apathy, gross negligence towards maternal and child health in the state and country, leading to the non-availability of the most vital ingredient of life, oxygen.

The recent teenage suicides have been attributed to internet games like the Blue Whale Challenge, and the failure to perform well in competitive exams, etc. But if we were to travel backwards on a temporal scale, we realize that the root cause of the problem is the non-availability of an essential ingredient to human life, an oxygen of a different kind.

What is the root cause of teenage suicides?

Cellphone is the most quickly adopted consumer technology in the history of the world. But recently, several studies are also throwing up the consequences of this technology on human beings. A study published in the Journal Of The Association For Consumer Research showed that just the presence of a cellphone next to a person or a person being present in the same room as one’s cellphone will reduce that person’s working memory and problem-solving skills.

The article in The Atlantic “Have Smartphones Destroyed A Generation” by Jean M. Twenge talks about the abrupt shifts in behaviours and emotional states of teenagers. The article focused on those born between 1995 and 2012, what the author refers to as the iGen generation.

According to the article, while 87% of the baby boomer generation, born between the 1940s and the 1960s, went on a date, only 57% of the iGen generation are likely to go on a date. The number of sexually active teenagers have reduced by 40% since 1991. The teenage pregnancy rate hit an all-time low in 2016. Unlike the previous generation of teenagers who waited for the day they turned 18 to apply for a driving licence, the passport to freedom, the iGen generation still prefers to be driven around by their parents.

What is the iGen generation up to? They are on their phones, sitting in their rooms, all alone. Their social life is spent on the phone. They don’t leave their rooms to interact with their friends. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of teens who got together with their friends dropped by more than 40%.

Famous British anthropologist Robin Dunbar had identified the limits of one’s social networks based in part on cognitive constraints and in part on the time costs of servicing these relationships.

Dunbar has identified 150 as the largest number of people that a human being can maintain a regular relationship with. Within this group, the 15 closest relationships become most crucial when it comes to one’s mental and physical heath. Dunbar concluded that of this set of 15 people, the number of people a human being depends for emotional support in times of crisis—the support clique—is only five.

But according to an article in the American Sociological Review, “Social Isolation In America: Changes In Core Discussion Networks Over Two Decades”, modern teenagers are paupers when it comes to having a support clique.

Based on data from General Social Survey (GSS), the study concluded that the number of teenagers who say they have no close friends has roughly tripled since 1985. “Zero” is the number of confidants reported by almost a quarter of those surveyed. Several other studies too have established that today’s teenagers are the loneliest generation in the history of mankind.

A 2009 study based on data collected from Framingham, Massachusetts since 1948, found that participants are 52% more likely to be lonely if someone they’re directly in touch with—friend, neighbour, co-worker of family member—is lonely. Loneliness is a contagious disease. But why has it recently gotten worse?

There is a direct correlation between loneliness and the usage of smartphones and social media. The more time a teenager spends on the smartphone, more likely that he or she will show symptoms of depression. Teens who spend more than 3 hours on their smartphones per day are 35% more at risk of suicide.

Loneliness among American teenagers peaked in 2013, the year the number of people who owned a smartphone crossed the 50% mark. The level of loneliness has remained high ever since.

India has one of the largest young populations in the world. It also has one of the largest user bases of smartphones in the world. India should be cognizant of the psychological toll of the smartphone.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said, we need to wean our children off their PlayStations and get them on to the playgrounds. Online social interactions are not an effective alternative to real face-to-face interactions.

Our educational system should be revamped so as to help enhance the face-to-face social interactions of teenagers. These social interactions are as life-giving as the oxygen cylinders were to the infants in the Gorakhpur hospital.

About 5 corridors are getting made, Mum-Ahd just completed its feasibility study earliest and submitted it to Govt and that is why its happening first. Others are still in study phase and China, Germany, France, Spain all are here.

178,"&gt;Construction of anything creates job. Doesn't need to be a bullet train. They could have constructed a new airport terminal. You could have constructed world class hospitals, schools and colleges around the country and each one of them would have created jobs.

True. But this project will be built from the loan given by Japan for the construction of bullet train. And I'm not sure if its ok to buy a car from a home loan.

&gt;Many planes can fly in one day and multiple times a day. Cheaper and faster, both at the same time.

&gt;As far as number of passengers is concerned, it's irrelevant unless the price of plane tickets is less than the price of bullet train tickets.

Again,true. Planes can fly multiple times a day, but with a very small capacity. Few hundred seats in a plane vs a thousand in a bullet train. Do the math. Saves money in operation costs.

&gt;12 stops? Is it a bullet train or a passenger train? 

&gt;Don't know where you got that number from but let's run with it. So you're telling me that there are people living in smaller cities between Mumbai and Ahmedabad who will pay a premium and travel in bullet trains?

Those ""**Smaller cities**"" (don't know how you came up with that title without knowing the names of the cities)  consist of Surat, Vapi, Vadodara, Anand, Bharuch, which are industrial cities &amp; play a huge part in Gujarat's(&amp; Mumbai's) business &amp; economy. Also answers the ""who'd pay the what"" for you.

&gt;My god, you've lost your mind.

Hey, thank you for noticing. Appreciate it.

&gt;Indians don't have that kind of purchase power. And even if somebody does, they would most definitely appreciate it more if cheaper trains are run on time and don't derail like a clockwork every 2 days.

You underestimate the purchasing power of Gujju bros &amp; by extension Marathi manoos when it comes to splurging on premium services (if you want to call those prices premium, which they aren't considering the amount of time saved &amp; comfort it provides)

This bullet train (Shinkansen as Japanese call it) is a different tech than regular railway lines. Known for its high standard of safety &amp; comfort. With only a couple of accidents in a couple of decades. Then again which tech is 100% safe?

&gt;Bullet trains is nothing but a vanity project for Modi.

***Acha, to Modi se problem hai? Woh kyun laya bullet? Hena?***

Congress dreamed it, took them loooong enough to even reach an agreement with Japan. Modi just brought it to fruition, just like most of the congressi schemes, which they could have achieved, but they were busy somewhere else doing something else. Scams :wink: :wink:

**'Main Tejashwi Yadav, Class 9 Pass', He Told Investigators** 

 ______ 
Tejashwi Yadav was asked 36 questions by investigators in connection with
corruption scandals.

**Patna: **

It wasn't exactly ""Bond, James Bond."" When seated across the table from four
investigators, the 28-year-old who brought down the Bihar government in July
said, ""

_Mera naam Tejashwi Yadav hai, main ninth pass hoon_

"" (I am Tejashwi Yadav, schooled till Class 9).

Tejashwi Yadav, along with his mother, Rabri Devi and sister Hema Yadav, was
interrogated in Patna for seven hours on August 29. He is named in a series of
corruption scandals along with his siblings and father, regional powerhouse
Lalu Yadav.

In 2015, he was made Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, with Nitish Kumar as his
boss. He owed his rank to his father's party winning the most seats in the
state election which were fought in alliance with Nitish Kumar and the
Congress. For the next two years, Tejashwi Yadav did not endeavor to shake off
the image of a privileged son cruising through the government, enjoying the
perks of being No 2 in the government but defaulting on basic duties like
showing up for crucial sessions of the legislature or important public events
which were headlined by the Chief Minister.

While Nitish Kumar tolerated this behavior, accepting it as the price of being
propped up in power by Lalu Yadav, a corruption scandal that broke in April
turned into a windfall for him. The CBI alleged that while he was Railways
Minister in the previous Congress-led government, Lalu Yadav assigned the
running of railways hotels in Bihar to private firms whose kickbacks traveled
through a maze of front companies to end in a series of posh homes and
commercial real estate owned by Lalu Yadav's children.

For seven hours, Tejashwi Yadav was asked 36 questions by investigators to
explain how he became a director in some of those companies ,which entitled
him to own, among other property, a large house in one of Delhi's fanciest
neighbourhoods. The plot has been seized by the Income Tax department.

Tejashwi Yadav and his family have denied any wrongdoing; they say the
expanding list of cases against them is evidence that Prime Minister Narendra
Modi employs investigative agencies to persecute political opponents who stand
up to him.

Tejashwi Yadav became the owner of the Delhi mansion in 2011. But he did not
disclose this when he listed his assets, as required, for the election that he
contested in 2015. Investigators say that though he resigned as a director of
the firm that owned the property before the election, he continued to sign
cheques issued by the firm, which proves that he was still running it and a
proxy owner of the property, worth about 40 crores.

He is accused of similar wrongdoing in owning a three-acre plot in Patna where
Bihar's largest mall was being constructed till earlier this year when the
centre stopped the development, claiming that environmental permissions were
missing for the project.

By early July, Nitish Kumar made it clear that with Tejashwi Yadav named for
corruption in the railways hotel case, the Yadavs were unacceptable allies.
Tejashwi Yadav countered that when the alleged swindle took place, he was
barely a teen, ""still too young to have a moustache."" Unmoved, Nitish Kumar
lined up the BJP as a new ally and nullified the government he ran with Lalu
Yadav and the Congress. Days later, he became the head of a new government
composed of his party and the BJP.

The Yadavs have pilloried him as an opportunist and Tejashwi Yadav undertook a
state-wide tour to offer his defence to the public, though the event was also
meant to cement his position as his father's political heir.

Last week, he wrote to the Chief Minister, requesting permission to remain in
the government-owned house that he lived in as Deputy Chief Minister. Not
possible, he was told. He has been given a month to move out.

**Regional Countries Should Have Partnerships Not Alliances: China** 

 ______ 
**Beijing: **

China today hoped that the growing ties between India and Japan would be
conducive to the peace and stability and insisted that the countries in the
region should work for partnership instead of forming an alliance.

The comments by the Chinese Foreign Ministry came as New Delhi and Tokyo
sought to firm up their close ties during Japanese Prime Minister Shizo Abe's
visit to India.

India and Japan inked 15 agreements to further broad-base their strategic
partnership and agreed to strengthen cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region
where China is increasing its assertiveness.

Asked about the growing Indo-Japan strategic partnership, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, ""We advocate that regional countries
should stand for dialogue without confrontation and work for partnership
instead of alliance.""

Ms Hua was replying to a question about Mr Abe's visit to India.

Ms Hua, however, declined to comment on specific issue like Japan's plans to
sell US-2 amphibious aircraft to India, saying she would like to wait till a
detailed readout from the two countries following a meeting between Abe and
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Japan's plans to sell the amphibious aircraft to India raised eyebrows here as
this is first such move by Tokyo to sell defence equipment to any country.
China is also concerned about Japan getting the first bullet train project in
India between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.

China too is vying for high speed rail projects in India, specially the New
Delhi-Chennai corridor.

China and Japan also have a longstanding dispute over islands in the East
China Sea. Chinese ties with Japan have also been strained by what Beijing see
as Japanese leaders' reluctance to atone for the country's wartime past.

Ms Hua said China will ""stay open and welcome normal development of relations
between the countries in the region"", as long as they are conducive to peace
and stability in the region.

""We hope that relations will be conducive to regional peace and stability and
can play a constructive role in this regard,"" she said.

Commenting on Abe's visit to India, Chinese think-tanks expressed concern over
the ""Freedom Corridor"", as well as several joint infrastructure projects being
launched by India and Japan together in different countries as strategic move
by the two countries to counterbalance China's ambitious multi- billion Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI).

The Indo-Japanese initiative, called the 'Freedom Corridor', stretching from
Asia-Pacific to Africa, aims at stabilising the region.

""The Freedom Corridor, designed to serve as a counterbalance to China's BRI is
expected to figure prominently in talks between Abe and Modi,"" Hu Zhiyong, a
research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai
Academy of Social Sciences told state-run Global Times today.

However, the Japanese-Indian initiative is just a beginning. It is unlikely to
reach the same level as the BRI, Chu Yin, an associate professor at the
University of International Relations said.

The Chinese analysts also referred to report that India and Japan were
embarking on multiple infrastructure projects across Africa, Iran, Sri Lanka
and Southeast Asia in what could be viewed as pushback against China's
unilateral infrastructure initiatives connecting it with Europe and Africa.

India boycotted the Belt and Road Forum (BRF) held this year due to its
sovereignty concerns over the USD 50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

""Though India objects to CPEC, India's real reason is that it doesn't want to
see China's influence in South Asia and refuses to open its domestic market to
China,"" Ye Hailin, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences'
National Institute of International Strategy, said.

Also the Global Times tabloid, in an editorial titled 'India-Japan intimacy no
threat to China' said ""in a changing world, the India-Japan intimacy is more
like a contrivance"".

It said Japan is unlikely to challenge China as it has strong bilateral trade
relations with Beijing.

""Under the international relations logic of the 21st century, closer India-
Japan ties won't pose grave threats to China because many of their emotional
moves to console each other won't produce any real effects in challenging
China,"" it said.

**Farmer suicides have gone up under BJP, says party MP Nana Patole** 

 ______ 
Backing the Opposition’s demand for a “blanket” farm loan waiver, Patole said the various caveats introduced by the Maharashtra government for farmers availing the waiver were unjust and uncalled for. Backing the Opposition’s demand for a “blanket” farm loan waiver, Patole said the various caveats introduced by the Maharashtra government for farmers availing the waiver were unjust and uncalled for.

BJP MP Nana Patole, who had kicked up a storm earlier this month by saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t like to take questions, on Wednesday fired a fresh salvo at his party, this time targeting Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and his government. Echoing the Opposition’s criticism, Patole, who represents Vidarbha’s Bhandara-Gondia constituency, said farmer suicides had increased under Fadnavis’s watch. “Farmers suicides were taking place in the state earlier too but the numbers have risen in these three years,” he said.

Taking another sharp dig, Patole said: “People are always mindful of leaders who change stance after assuming positions of power. The chief minister is a friend. And I’m proud of the fact that my friend is now at the helm of the state. But when a friend makes a mistake, I take it as my duty to point it out to him. He should improve and work for the betterment of the people.”

Backing the Opposition’s demand for a “blanket” farm loan waiver, Patole said the various caveats introduced by the Maharashtra government for farmers availing the waiver were unjust and uncalled for. He said he has also been a vocal critic of the complicated online application process for the waiver.

The MP said during his meeting with the Chief Minister on Wednesday, he had raised the issue of the “extremely insensitive” and “unwarranted” remarks made by the state’s Revenue Minister, Chandrakant Patil, who was quoted on Monday as saying over 10 lakh applications for farm loan waiver were “bogus”.

“How can a minister make such insensitive and baseless remarks is beyond me. Their (the government’s) online portal for the loan waiver has been accepting the applications. How were bogus claimants allowed to apply? Also, the scrutiny of the applications is yet to begin. If such insensitive remarks are made, Nana Patole won’t keep quiet. This has enraged me,” he said. The BJP MP further criticised the Fadnavis government for being unable to provide commensurate returns to paddy farmers.

While making a U-turn on his alleged criticism of Modi — he now maintains that the PM has never stopped him from raising issues — Patole reiterated his complaint that several state projects were stuck because of lack of coordination between the state and central agencies.

Sources said close ties of the Prime Minister and the ruling government with NCP leader Praful Patel — Patole’s arch-rival — has upset the MP, who hails from the same constituency. There is also speculation in political circles that Patole has an offer to join the Shiv Sena. When asked, Patole avoided a direct answer, but said, “I’m in touch with Uddhavji, former NDA ally Raju Shetti, and independent MLA Bacchu Kadu, among others.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to host his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe for a special Gujarati feast in Ahmedabad. Prime Minister’s favorite dish ‘Handvo’ will be served to Abe in the feast. PM Modi, Abe and his wife Akie, will have dinner at city’s noted Agashiye terrace restaurant, popular for the view and kosher Gujarati cuisine, NDTV reports. The hotel offers a delightful view of some of the city’s famous spots. A diner can see heritage spots including the Siddi Sayeed Ni Jaali mosque. The thali is going to be all-vegetarian, featuring PM’s favourite “Handvo” or vegetable cake, besides khichdi kadhi. The dishes are likely to include some Japanese dishes in case the Japanese Prime Minister, his wife and other delegation members wish for a dish they are more familiar with.

Later on Thursday, Abe and Modi are scheduled to attend the ground breaking (bhoomi poojan) ceremony of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed railway, also known as bullet train project, a flagship programme of the India-Japan collaboration. The two head of nations are scheduled to attend the ground-breaking ceremony of the ‘High-Speed Railway Training Institute’ being set up in Vadodara through a video link.

Modi and Abe will also attend a business plenary before visiting the Dandi Kutir in Gandhinagar, which is India’s largest museum showcasing the life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. New Delhi-Tokyo ties are on an upswing in a range of areas, including defence and security. The discussions between the two nations may also feature Nuclear pact, signed in 2016, the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), launched in May this year.

**Telugu writer under fire for terming trading community ‘social smugglers’** 

 ______ 
Kancha Ilaiah, a popular writer and activist, has landed in a controversy over a Telugu book that describes Vysyas – members of the trading community – as “social smugglers”.

Ilaiah, known for his pro-Dalit stand, complained to the Hyderabad police on Monday that he has been receiving threat calls from unidentified people ever since his book was launched. “The calls and messages are abusive, and they have even threatened to cut off my tongue,” the retired political science professor with Osmania University told mediapersons. “Maybe they intend to murder me just like Gauri Lankesh was killed in Bengaluru.”

A particularly caustic extract from the book – Samajika Smugglurlu Komatollu (Vysyas are social smugglers) – goes thus: “Vysyas have always hated Shudras, Dalits and OBCs who are involved in the production of goods. They never take up the job of protecting the country – there is no baniya regiment in the Army. They are part of the ruling class – Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are baniyas – and they are backed by business tycoons like the Ambanis and Adanis. They are culturally vegetarians, so how can they fight mighty enemies like Pakistan and China if they don’t eat meat or beef?”

The Arya Vysya Sangham held protest rallies across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh after the contents of the book were circulated in the social media. According to association members, Ilaiah habitually insults certain castes and communities through his writings. “He also made derogatory comments against Hindu gods in the past, hurting religious sentiments,” one of them said on the condition of anonymity.

J Venkateshwar, president of the Andhra Pradesh Arya Vysya Mahasabha, said a complaint would be lodged against Ilaiah. Pointing out that several members of the Arya Vysya community – including Mahatma Gandhi – had played a crucial role in the freedom struggle, he said: “Ilaiah should apologise to the Arya-Vysya community people, failing which we will register protests wherever he goes in the state.”

The Vysya community demanded that the book be banned, and Ilaiah placed under arrest immediately.

**Overseas investors bullish on India dollar debt even as economy slows; here’s why** 

 ______ 
For all the weak spots in India’s economy, investor love for the nation’s offshore bonds endures.Companies have sold $10.6 billion of dollar debt so far in 2017, the most in three years, as one of the highest returns in Asia and prospects of a sovereign-rating upgrade prompt buyers to ignore data showing gross domestic product in the June quarter expanded at the slowest pace since 2014.“There’s not only large institutional demand but also high retail appetite,” A.S. Thiyaga Rajan, a senior managing director at Aquarius Investment Advisors in Singapore, said by phone. “Some top Indian names are coming up” with dollar debt offerings, he said.The optimism around Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies and prospects of outsized profits are proving hard to resist for bond bulls. Dollar-denominated debt from India has returned 5.68 percent this year, compared with 4.95 percent in China and 2.98 percent in South Korea, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. indexes.There’s more juice left in the rally, according to Anthony Leung, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.‘Good Value’India’s investment-grade company bonds “remains a pocket of good value” across Asia and the steps taken by Modi’s government are “steering the economy in the right direction,” he wrote in a Sept. 7 note. While challenges remain in cleaning up bad loans at banks, the start of an unified sales tax, abolition of subsidies and low oil prices will help offset the problems, he said.The policy measures are bearing fruit and will lead to the nation’s credit rating being raised by Moody’s Investors Service “within a year,” Leung said. A Moody’s spokesperson said the firm does not comment on third-party speculation on ratings.Rating firms have India just above “junk” status and while Modi’s government has pushed for an upgrade in the past few years, Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have all pushed back, citing high debt levels.Green BondsThat said, the unexpected slowdown in growth hasn’t put investors off India’s corporate debt or slowed new issuance. Buyers have drawn confidence from the fact that the nation is still one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a strong political mandate gives Modi more policy flexibility to revive expansion.Power Finance Corp., a state-run lender to utilities, has sought bids from credit rating firms for its $1 billion medium-term notes. Bharat Petroleum Corp. plans to raise $500 million via Singapore-listed bonds, Director of Finance K. Sivakumar said Tuesday. State Bank of India plans to raise up to $3 billion in the nation’s biggest overseas green-bond issue, the Economic Times reported last week, citing an unnamed executive close to the initiative.“There’s more demand than supply for Indian bonds as investors bet on the outlook of the Modi-led economy,” said Bryan Wang, a fund manager at Fuh-Hwa Investment Trust Co. in Taipei.

**PM Narendra Modi faces fire as he launches bullet train project** 

 ______ 
AHMEDABAD/NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched his ambitious bullet train project today, insisting it would bring ""convenience and safety, employment and speed"", he was bombarded with criticism by friends and foes alike.The main opposition Congress called the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed train an ""election bullet train"" project launched with an eye on the upcoming Gujarat Assembly polls, BJP's ally Shiv Sena said it might be a dream project of Modi but not for the common man.""It's not the time to move forward slowly as time doesn't wait. The bullet train will bring in convenience and safety, employment and speed,"" he said as he launched the Rs 1.10 lakh crore venture with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Ahmedabad.However, ally Shiv Sena was far from impressed.""We are getting a bullet train without asking for it. We do not know exactly which problem will this problem solve,"" the Sena said in an editorial in the party's mouthpiece 'Saamana'.Pandit (Jawaharlal) Nehru laid the foundation of several projects, from Bhakra Nangal to Bhaba Atomic Research Centre, to ensure the country advances in technology and science. All these projects were needed for the nation, it said.""Does this bullet train fit into the needs of the country?"" it asked and raked up the issue of agrarian distress in some states.It said the demand for waiver of farm loans was being made for the last several years and that nobody sought a bullet train.""The demand for loan waiver of farmers was being made for the last several years. Nobody sought a bullet train. Modi's dream is not of the common man but of the rich and industrialists,"" the Sena, which shares power with BJP both in Maharashtra and at the Centre, said.The opposition Congress, too, mounted a scalding offensive against Modi, saying the launch of the venture ahead of the Gujarat election followed a pattern of the prime minister announcing economic packages and projects before state polls.Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge accused the Modi government of ""completely abdicating"" its responsibility towards the safety of passengers. He also claimed that the project was conceptualised by the previous UPA government.""It is a matter of deep concern that while the prime minister once again adopted a UPA (government) project, it took him three-and-a-half years to come to this stage of laying the foundation stone. It is only timed with the Gujarat elections in mind...This is nothing but a 'chunavi bullet train',"" Kharge told reporters in New Delhi.He claimed the government had allocated only five per cent of the Rs 1.1 lakh crore required for railway safety despite ""horrific"" train accidents taking place in the last couple of years.Congress spokesperson RPN Singh alleged that the BJP government was ignoring railway safety even though 259 passengers have been killed and 973 injured in 29 major railway accidents since the Modi dispensation assumed office.""They (the government) is unable to set right the faults which are causing ordinary trains to jump the tracks. Imagine what would happen if a bullet train gets off the rails,"" another Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit said.However, Abe lauded Modi for being a ""farsighted"" leader in thinking of bringing the high-speed train to India.""My good friend Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a farsighted leader. He took a decision two years ago to bring a high-speed train in India and to create a new India,"" he said.In his speech after the launch of the project, Modi took on those who were criticising him over it. ""When earlier I talked about bringing bullet train, they (opposition) used to say when will it be done. Now that we are bringing it, they are asking why,"" he said.""Our stress is now on high-speed connectivity which will improve speed, reduce distance and ensure economic progress,"" he added.He termed as a ""big gift"" from ""friend"" Japan the project, which when completed, would see the train covering the distance of 500 km between the two cities in less than three hours instead of the usual seven now.

**Why $7.8 Billion Submarine Deal Is Tough For India And Japan** 

 ______ 
Supplying submarine technology would lock Japan and India into a tighter
defence ties for years to come.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe holds his 10th summit with Prime Minister
Narendra Modi today, underscoring the importance of strategic ties between the
countries as the two face an increasingly assertive China. Supplying submarine
technology would lock Japan and India into an even tighter defense
relationship for years to come.

Despite the close relationship between the two right-leaning nationalist
leaders, Japan is hesitant to plunge into negotiations on submarine exports.

Japan is among the countries India contacted for information about cooperating
on its plans for six diesel submarines to add to the underwater fleet it is
seeking to build to counter that of China, in a project worth about 50,000
crore rupees ($7.8 billion). The two governments held their first round of
talks on overall defense technology cooperation last week, but are not
currently in negotiations on the submarine project, according to a Japanese
foreign ministry official who asked not to be named.

In India, an official from the Ministry of Defence who asked not to be named
citing rules, said the process for submarine procurement had just been
initiated with the Japanese submarine builder. It will be a long, drawn
process, said another Ministry of Defence official.

Indian Navy spokesman D. K. Sharma said he had no comment on the matter.

While the Japanese government is not ruling out a deal, here are some reasons
why it probably won't be the front runner.

**Price Tag**

Japan only loosened its decades-old self-imposed ban on defense exports in
2014. The exclusively domestic focus of the industry has kept it small in
scale, resulting in higher costs, which are off-putting for India. The two
countries have, for example, been negotiating a possible sale of ShinMaywa's
US-2 amphibious aircraft for years, but have so far failed to agree on a
price.

The roughly $12 billion yen ($109 million) per plane price tag, depending on
specifications, is one of the key sticking points, according to the Japanese
foreign ministry official. He added that the talks would take some time.

**Make in India**

PM Modi's campaign to have more high-tech goods made on Indian soil will make
any submarine deal more difficult. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, the two firms that build Japan's submarines,
will be concerned about whether they can maintain quality, according to
Abhijit Singh, a former naval officer who is now at New Delhi's Observer
Research Foundation.

""That doesn't work because if Indians build it and something goes wrong then
the Japanese reputation takes a knock,"" Singh said in an interview. Both
companies declined to comment on the matter.

**Japanese Reluctance**

""There is still some hesitancy in the political-defense community of Japan,""
over loosening restrictions on defense exports, said Hiroshi Hirabayashi, a
former Japanese ambassador to India, who now serves as president of the Japan-
India Association. In line with its pacifist constitution, Japan until
recently treated the U.S. as virtually the only exception to the ban.

Singh noted that Japan remained ""secretive"" about its submarine technology,
which is among the most sensitive for any government.

**Submarine Suitability**

Japan's Soryu submarine is far larger than the model India is seeking. ""It's
too sophisticated for India's needs and Japan knows this,"" former naval
officer Singh said. That would mean a re-design, which adds a fresh element of
risk to a complex process.

India has widened its search for the right submarine, said K.V. Kuber, a New
Delhi-based independent defense analyst who has been on several government-
appointed panels on military procurement.

""The choice was always between DCNS (renamed as Naval Group) and HDW
(Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft),"" Kuber said. ""I now see the options have
included the traditional Russians, Spain's Navantia, and a new entrant in this
game, Mitsubushi Kawasaki, along with Sweden's Kockums."" The process has the
""fundamental strength of letting the choice of the platform and the potential
vendors be determined by the market forces.""

**Raid Raj: Changes in Income Tax law allow sleuths to raid at will, cite no reasons for suspicion** 

 ______ 
In a controversial tweaking of the Income Tax laws, the government has legalised tax raids on people based on mere suspicion, unsubstantiated rumour, or plain whim.

The amendment to Section 132 of the Income Tax Act also means the Narendra Modi government has backtracked on its promise to not amend laws in retrospect.

All you need to know: According to the amended rules, an income tax raid may be authorised if there is a ""reason to believe"" or ""reason to suspect"" that a person is hiding his wealth. The law will allows taxmen to not reveal to the person raided or any appellate tribunal the ""reason to believe"" or ""reason to suspect"" a violation. The amendment to the law will be effective from April 1, 1962. One of the changes made in the law says an Income Tax authority can ask another authority to ""requisition from some other officer or authority to deliver books of account, documents or assets of the assessee to the income tax authority so authorised."" The amendment effectively makes taxman unaccountable to any court or appellate tribunal to explain whether he or she had any credible information before ordering the raid. The amendment is being attributed to the Vodafone tax case that erupted during the Congress-led UPA government. In the Vodafone case, the retrospective tax changes were made from 1962 to undermine a Supreme Court verdict that went in favour of the UK company. In his Budget speech in 2014, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had assured the government there will not be any retrospective amendment to a law. ""The sovereign right of the government to undertake retrospective legislation is unquestionable. However, this power has to be exercised with extreme caution and judiciousness keeping in mind the impact of each such measure on the economy and the overall investment climate. This government will not ordinarily bring about any change retrospectively which creates a fresh liability,"" Jaitley had said. Last week, in a bid to clamp down on unaccounted money funnelled into bank accounts after demonetisation, the tax department had scrutinised and matched as many as one crore accounts and asked 18 lakh people to explain the source of their funds.

**Tax officials may go for searches, surveys to widen base under GST** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: In its attempt to bring more companies under the goods and services tax ( GST ) umbrella, the tax department is planning to conduct searches and surveys across the country, a senior tax official told ET.The searches could start as early as next week and would focus on checking if any company was deliberately avoiding to come under GST umbrella or if there is a genuine problem, said the official. Tax officers would conduct physical verification of premises in several areas and check the GST certificates in cases where they have been issued.The move comes about a week after a meeting of senior tax officials with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi.""As you know that the government is working towards increasing the tax base,"" the official said. ""So we recently received directions that new registrations under GST have to be increased. In that regard we will conduct surveys across the country to find out the eligible businesses that have still not registered with us. So our officers will be soon on field to get this moving.""Industry insiders said many companies and businessmen, especially in some unorganised sectors, are deliberately avoiding to come under GST because they fear tax sleuths would go after their past unpaid taxes Experts welcomed the government's push to increase tax base but said it should not lead to harassment of people with genuine issues. ""I don't see anything wrong with searches as it's obvious that the government wants to expand the GST base and they want to come hard on people who are evading taxes,"" said Pratik Jain, national leader -indirect tax, at PwC India.""But there should be some guidance by the GST Council in the form of a circular or instruction to ensure that there is no harassment at the ground level and officers differentiate between people evading taxes and genuine problems a company may be facing,"" he said.Under the current push, tax officers would visit premises of several businesses, especially in the industrial areas. In some way, officers have already started doing this. ET had first reported on July 8 that about 200 senior IAS, IRS and IFS officers have been asked to check if essential commodities are available across cities and small towns and if any noticeable price trends are visible.These officials are going around in local markets from Vadodara in Gujarat and Mayurbhanj in Odisha to Rajouri in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu to check whether GST is being implemented as intended. In one such incident, a cloth retailer in the National Capital Region was reportedly fined Rs 20,000 for selling shirts without paying GST on that.""Such fines are required; there has to be some fear if anyone is breaking the law,"" said a second tax officer aware of the development. ""Some people have also found loopholes and are staying out of GST net,"" the officer said.The tax department's renewed push comes weeks after the Haryana excise and taxation department asked its tax officers to conduct searches on companies in the state.In a circular issued on August 10, the department mentioned eight points that tax officers have to follow along with a timeline for each process.

**Maoists condemn Gauri Lankesh murder, ask people to hit streets for ‘determined fight’** 

 ______ 
In a release issued by Abhay, spokesman for Central Committee of CPI (Maoist), said, “The party strongly condemns the murder of Leftist, pro-people, progressive and democratic journalist Gauri Lankesh..” In a release issued by Abhay, spokesman for Central Committee of CPI (Maoist), said, “The party strongly condemns the murder of Leftist, pro-people, progressive and democratic journalist Gauri Lankesh..”

The Communist Party of India (Maoist) has rejected the “propaganda by Hindu fascist forces” that Kannada journalist Gauri Lankesh was killed by Maoists. It said that the “Sangh Parivar” killed Lankesh to muzzle the voice of pro-people forces.

In a release issued by Abhay, spokesman for Central Committee of CPI (Maoist), said, “The party strongly condemns the murder of Leftist, pro-people, progressive and democratic journalist Gauri Lankesh by Brahminical fascist goons of the Sangh Parivar protected by the BJP government at the Centre. The party appeals to all like-minded forces to hit the streets for a determined fight against the forces that killed Lankesh.”

Observing that Lankesh fearlessly campaigned for the downtrodden and the marginalised, against atrocities on minorities by Hindutva forces and corrupt governments, the party has said, “Lankesh had become an eyesore for the Hindutva forces ever since she had translated the book ‘Gujarat Files’ by Gujarat journalist Rana Ayyub exposing the involvement of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in the Muslim carnage in 2002. She had printed the matter in her publication in Kannada language. The fascist Hindutva hand was evident from the fact that BJP leader D N Yuvraj had said that she would have been alive had she not celebrated the death of RSS people.”

The CPI (Maoist) also targeted PM Modi for his silence on her murder which it says was “indicative of the Hindutva hand in her murder”. “It is their lowly and dirty act to pressure and get her brother to hint at the possibility of Maoist hand in her murder,” the release further says.

The party has rubbished the probe ordered into Lankesh’s murder saying, “when the rulers themselves are complicit in it, everybody knows what is going to be the outcome of such a probe. That is the reason, till now, there has been no headway in the probe in the murders of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, Leftist thinker Govind Pansare and progressive writer M M Kalburgi.”

The party called for intensifying struggle against “fascist Hindutva forces” by all progressive and democratic forces beyond “symbolic protests” with “now or never” urgency.

**Indo-Japan ties hit bullet speed, send message to Pakistan, China** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: India and Japan on Thursday decided to ramp up their strategic partnership with a declared aim to maintain stability in Asia, and urged Pakistan to act against perpetrators of 26/11 in a joint statement.The 12th edition of the Indo-Japan annual summit, held in Ahmedabad within weeks of the Dokalam standoff between China and India, also sent a veiled message to Beijing that is seen as aggressive. The two countries chose to title the joint statement issued after the summit 'Toward a Free, Open and Prosperous Indo-Pacific'.Led by PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe , the two sides signed 15 MoUs and pacts across sectors at the summit. In a joint press conference with Abe, Modi said partnerships between the two countries are not limited to bilateral or regional spheres.""We have close cooperation on global issues as well."" While the joint statement did not mention the Dokalam standoff, sources said the issue is understood to have figured in Modi-Abe talks. Japan was the only country that publicly supported India on the standoff.""Dokalam is not specifically mentioned in the statement,"" foreign secretary S Jaishankar said at a media briefing in Ahmedabad. ""I think there was a discussion on regional and global developments yesterday (Wednesday) in the broader sense of the term,"" he said, referring to closed-door discussions between the two leaders.

Emphasising a stronger bilateral counter-terror partnership and increased sharing of information and intelligence, the joint statement called on Pakistan to ""bring to justice the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks including those of the terrorist attack in Mumbai and in Pathankot"".The two countries agreed to strengthencooperation against terrorist threats from groups including Al Qaeda, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and their affiliates. In an oblique criticism of China's ambitious One Belt One Road (Obor) project, Modi and Abe called on all countries to ensure the development and use of connectivity infrastructure in an open, transparent and non-exclusive manner based on international standards and responsible debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law and the environment.North Korea's nuclear ambitions, including threats to Japan, too, was strongly criticised by the two leaders.Memorandum of Cooperation between the home ministry and the Cabinet Office of Japan Aims to cooperate in disaster risk reduction and share experiences, knowledge and policies on disaster prevention--Memorandum of Cooperation in Japanese language education in India between MEA &amp; MOFA, Japan To strengthen cooperation in Japanese language education in India--India-Japan Act East Forum To enhance connectivity and promote developmental projects in India's Northeast--Arrangement between India Post and Japan Post for implementation of Cool EMS service Aims to send fresh food from Japan to India in cool boxes for Japanese in India--India-Japan investment promotion roadmap between DIPP and METI To facilitate Japanese investment in IndiaMemorandum of Cooperation between METI and Gujarat for Make In India in Mandal Bechraj-Khoraj in Gujarat To cooperate in infrastructure development in the Mandal Bechraj-Khoraj region--Exchange of record of decisions in civil aviation Indian and Japanese carriers can now fly unlimited number of flights to the select cities of each other's countries-- Science &amp; Technology* Agreement for exchange programme between interdisciplinary theoretical and mathematical sciences (iTHEMS), RIKEN and National Centres for Biological Sciences (Simons-NCBS)* To identify and foster talented young scientists from both the countries to collaborate in theoretical biology* Joint research contract between National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science &amp; Technology, Japan, and Department of Biotechnology (DBT)* To conduct joint research and to establish an international centre named as 'DBT-AIST International Centre for Translational &amp; Environmental Research (DAICENTER)' at AIST, Japan* MoU Between DBT and National Institute of Advanced Science &amp; Technology To promote research collaboration between DBT Research Institutes and AIST in the field of life science and biotechnology--* MoU on academic and sports exchange between Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education and Nippon Sports Science University* To facilitate and deepen international education cooperation and exchanges between the sports bodies* Letter Of Intent between Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education and University of Tsukuba* To strengthen strategic collaboration, joint research programme and exchanges between the two bodies* Letter Of Intent between Sports Authority of India and University of Tsukuba, Japan* To strengthen strategic collaboration, joint research programme and exchanges between the two* MoU between RIS and IDE-JETRO for promotion of cooperation in researchrelated activities* To promote institutional cooperation between RIS and IDE-JETRO to strengthen research and effectiveness of dissemination of research findings

**In ‘Jai’ Ho mode, Modi and Abe plan Asia-Africa link to counter China** 

 ______ 
AHMEDABAD: The groundbreaking announcement of India's first bullet train project on Thursday signalled the fast-tracking of India-Japan ties as PM Narendra Modi and his counterpart, Shinzo Abe, looked to strategically align India's 'Act East' policy with Japan's 'Open Pacific' initiative and fashion an Asia-Africa ""growth corridor"".Abe's evocative reference to how merging Japan's 'Ja' and India's 'I' will result in 'JaI' at the launch of the bullet train project heralded the warmth in ties. While the Japanese PM said he would do all he could for India, Modi responded by saying Japan was a true friend which offered loans at virtually no interest. ""The difference a half percent can make in interest rates is evident, particularly to people in Ahmedabad... Here is a friend who says 'Pay back the loan over 50 years',"" said Modi, acknowledging Abe's commitment to initiatives such as Make in India.Modi's fourth annual summit with Abe saw a strong commitment to ensuring unhindered commerce and trade through the India-Pacific region with the convergence of India's interests with Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy offering an alternative vision to China's OBOR (One Belt, One Road). India and Japan signed 15 agreements after the talks, one of which was to create an Act East Forum.The forum will aim at enhancing connectivity and promoting developmental projects in India's northeast in an ""efficient and effective manner"". With many seeing OBOR as an instrument to further China's geopolitical objectives, the two PMs delivered a clear message to Beijing as they called on India and Japan to play a central role in safeguarding a rule-based order in the India-Pacific through maritime security cooperation, more defence exchanges and by improving connectivity.Despite the focus on strengthening defence cooperation, the two countries couldn't finalise an agreement for purchase of US 2i surveillance aircraft by India from Japan. Foreign secretary S Jaishankar said discussions were still on. Also, India and Japan decided to drop a specific mention of South China Sea from the joint statement despite reaffirming their commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight in the India-Pacific. Jaishankar said the principle was being acknowledged in the reference to India-Pacific rather than ""specific geographies"". This is significant as India and China weeks ago successfully resolved the Doklam stand-off.Jaishankar said the joint statement dealt with a full set of issues in the Indo-Pacific and under that all ""sub-sets"" were covered. However, the fact is that both 2016 and 2015 Modi-Abe joint statements had a specific reference to South China Sea while underlining the significance of freedom of navigation.Asked if Doklam was discussed in the talks, Japanese officials said all issues of strategic interests came up in the dialogue. When asked the same question, Jaishankar said while it wasn't specifically discussed, there was a discussion on regional and global developments in a broader sense. He did make a pointed reference that the North Korea crisis highlighted the need to remember ""backward linkages"" to its missile and nuclear programme — a pointer to China as much as Pakistan.In a not so subtle dig at China, Modi and Abe underlined the importance of all countries in ensuring the development and use of connectivity infrastructure ""in an open, transparent and non-exclusive manner based on international standards and responsible debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, rule of law, and the environment"". India has accused China of undermining its sovereignty through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , a showpiece OBOR project.There was no formal launch of an Asia-Africa growth corridor, but Modi and Abe welcomed efforts to explore development of industrial corridors and networks which, the joint statement said, will benefit various stakeholders in the India-Pacific region including Africa. As expected, Abe in his meeting with Modi called for ""combining'' Asia, a continent that is rapidly growing, with Africa which has huge growth potential.While differences remain over US2i aircraft, India appreciated Japan's readiness to provide its state-of-the-art amphibian aircraft as symbolising the high degree of trust between the two countries. Significantly, the two PMs welcomed the renewed momentum for trilateral cooperation with US and Australia as they stressed the strategic importance of these cooperative frameworks. This led to speculation if India could look at the idea of having a quadrilateral cooperation mechanism involving the four, as was suggested by Australia years ago, but Indian officials later ruled out having made any such proposal.

**Govt continues to procure branded drugs even as it bats for generics** 

 ______ 
The government has been pushing for generic drugs for a while. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint

New Delhi: Generic medicines in India may have received a boost with Prime Minister Narendra Modi backing them, but his government’s own record in procuring such drugs for state-run hospitals is less than impressive.

Medical Stores Organization (MSO), the procurement unit for the ministry of health and family welfare, has not been able to source low-cost drugs for its beneficiaries over the last few years. In fact, it continues to buy expensive branded and patented drugs, ignoring its own directive for promoting the cheaper generics.

The MSO procures, stores and supplies medicines, surgical items and medical equipment to public health facilities.

It had floated tenders for procurement of generic medicines through its government medical store depots (GMSD) in Hyderabad and Kolkata in 2015 and 2016.

Of the total quantity covered in these tenders, comprising 820 generic drugs in both depots, only 152—or 19%—was procured.

Against that, the tender for procuring branded drugs was “well timed”, three people aware of the development disclosed, requesting anonymity. “The government procurement agency finalized the tender in 2015 and then again in 2017. In fact, a special tender for 22 medicines which contained nine patented drugs also received a go-ahead,” people cited above said.

For government-run hospitals and beneficiaries of Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), procurement is done through a public tender that awards the contract to the lowest bidder.

In the tenders floated for procuring generic drugs by the MSO, only a select band of firms from across the country participated and bid for it.

“The ministry officials have turned a blind eye to these lapses and high costs, and are going ahead with procurement at the expense of the exchequer. There has been no focus to bring generic drugs. Branded drugs continue to remain the preferred choice of the government procurement agency over generics despite various announcements, incurring extra expenditure. Only select manufacturers are allowed to bid in these multi-crore tenders of the MSO. While the tender for procuring generic drugs has been put on the back burner, the MSO did not go slow in procuring expensive patented drugs,” added one of the three people, who asked not to be named.

Those familiar with the development alleged violation of procurement rules by the MSO during procurement.

“The buying of high-valued patented gliptins, which is a patented drug for diabetes, under the garb of generic drugs was in clear violation of procurement norms,” they added. Those privy to it also disclosed that even in the above-cited bids, the drugs were procured at a much higher price than the other drug procuring agencies within the ministry.

Bharat Singh, deputy director general, MSO, blamed “restrictive tender conditions” for the poor response to these tenders. “There were a number of issues which cannot be explained. For example, there are some companies which do not make generic drugs so we are left with no choice but to buy branded drugs. I can confidently say that due procedure was followed in the tender process.”

Navdeep Rinwa, a joint secretary in the health ministry, said, “I can’t make any comments on the tender process at this point of time. There is a formulary for generic drugs but I don’t have figures with me.”

The government has been pushing for generic drugs for a while, but the move gained momentum with Modi announcing plans to put in place a legal framework to ensure doctors prescribe generic medicines.

Earlier, the Medical Council of India instructed doctors to prescribe generic drugs as much as possible.

**Maruti will make electric cars in Gujarat - Times of India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government's push to electric vehicles received a boost on Thursday with Maruti's Japanese parent Suzuki Motor deciding to make electric cars at its factory in Gujarat for India and the world. It will also be the first commercially-available electric car for Suzuki.The Japanese company had once showcased an all-electric version for Swift (called Swift REEV, or Range Extender) around 2010. However, this was never commercially produced. Suzuki will use the country as a key global manufacturing base. ""For the last 35 years, we have been working towards 'Make in India' with you all,"" Suzuki chairman Osamu Suzuki said at a business leaders' meet in Gujarat where PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe were also present. Suzuki will also pump in a fresh $600 million (Rs 3,900 crore) in the state for a new plant at Hansalpur with a capacity of 2.5 lakh units. It will increase investments in the state to over $2.1 billion (Rs 13,400 crore) as it moves to boost annual manufacturing capacity in Gujarat to 7.5 lakh units within the next couple of years.While production has already started from plant A, which has a capacity for 2.5 lakh units annually and is used for manufacturing Baleno, work on a similar capacity plant (B) is already in progress with production target set for 2019. Plant C will follow thereafter. The company is also setting up a combustion engine plant at the facility for 5 lakh units.Suzuki will set up a lithium-ion battery factory that will charge electric, hybrid and other vehicles from the company's stable. Denso, a Toyota company, will provide the technology, while Toshiba will chip in with cell modules. Together, the three companies will invest $180 million (Rs 1,151 crore) for the plant, which will be operational by 2020. It is expected that the batteries will be used to power Maruti and Suzuki's electric vehicles, some of which could be all-new ones, while others will be clean-fuel variants of existing petrol/diesel models.Suzuki started making direct investments in India for manufacturing vehicles and engines after Maruti — where it holds nearly 56% stake — exhausted its annual capacity of 15 lakh units in Haryana (through factories in Gurgaon and Manesar). Mahindra &amp; Mahindra has the lead in electric vehicles technology through its acquisition of Reva Electric Car a few years ago. Other companies that are actively working on electric vehicles technology are Tata Motors, Hyundai and Nissan.

**For 95% Commuters, Bullet Train Means Nothing: Bibek Debroy To NDTV** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi and Japan's Shinzo Abe launched work on the bullet train
project.

**New Delhi: **

It may have been the top trend of the day with #BulletTrain spinning super-
fast dreams for the twitterati, but Bibek Debroy, a railway expert, says

the $19 billion project

will be irrelevant for all but a tiny portion of Indians.

""95% people are those that travel in unreserved compartments, and not Rajdhani
or Shatabdi. To them this day counts for nothing,"" said Dr Debroy, who is a
member of the NITI Aayog, the government's main policy think-tank.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi

and Japanese premier Shinzo Abe launched the Ahemdabad-Mumbai bullet train
project today, which is to be completed in 2022, and will link the two huge
trading centres in a 2-hour journey. Japan is providing 85 percent of the cost
of the new train link in soft loans.

Bibek Debroy said the bullet train project could help raise the value of
surrounding areas.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and other government handles
described the laying of the foundation stone today as ""historic"".

But Dr Debroy, who has chaired a committee that looked at major railway
projects, said that the

criticism

,

including from opposition parties

, of a bullet train overshadowing basic and wide problems with the 164-year-
old rail network is ""vacuous"".

Abhishek Manusinghvi of the Congress tweeted that the bullet train is a
misplaced priority.

&gt; Shah Jahan's Taj Mahal was accompanied by famine &amp;amp; destitution 4general
population. #bullettrain wl run..rest u can guess

&gt;

&gt; \- Abhishek Singhvi (@DrAMSinghvi) September 14, 2017

Totally dismissing this, Dr Debroy explained that the bullet train isn't being
funded at the expense of other rail projects. ""Even when Japan helped us built
the metro, they offered to do that or the bullet train. So the argument
doesn't stand,"" he said. While the government is being attacked over the fact
that derailments have risen in the last 10 years claiming 51 per cent of 458
deaths, the economist explained that the reason was tracks being overused so
heavily that there was no time for basic upkeeps. ""You need to have at least 2
hours daily to just maintain the tracks. These lines are used perhaps every 5
minutes. So the only way is to delay trains. That's the trade-off for safety.""

The bullet train project will be a joint venture between the Indian Railways
and Japanese firm Shinkansen Technology.

When asked if the bullet train project, which was inaugurated in Gujarat, is
being used to win public opinion ahead of elections in the state, he
responded, ""This has been in the works for years now. And there is always some
election around the corner."" But the choice of Ahmedabad? ""It needed to be
800-1,000 km stretch without any obstruction, a straight road. The only other
one which perhaps has potential like that is Delhi-Chandigarh.""

As for whether the 1.1lakh crore project will be viable by the time the loan
is paid off in the 50 years granted by Japan, you may need to think again. ""I
don't think even the Japan bullet trains are viable. Nowhere is it viable, but
the real estate around it can be viable,"" said Dr Debroy.

**PM Modi's 'Big Gift' To Delhi: New Highways In Next 6 Months** 

 ______ 
PM Modi to present ""big gift"" to Delhiites by inaugurating highways in next 6
months, Nitin Gadkari said.

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will present a ""big gift"" to Delhi'ites by
inaugurating several highways in the next six months to free the city from
traffic jams and pollution, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday.

In the last two years, the Modi government has provided Rs. 40,000 crore for
infrastructure development in Delhi, Mr Gadkari said while addressing a two-
day executive meeting of the Delhi BJP.

""Six months from now on, PM Modi will give a big gift to the people of Delhi
by inaugurating several highways that will free the city from traffic jams and
pollution,"" the Union Road Transport and Highways minister was quoted as
saying in a Delhi BJP statement.

The expansion of NH-24 heading towards Meerut with an expenditure of Rs. 6,000
crore will use the waste dumped at the Ghazipur landfill site, providing a big
relief to locals, the minister said. Earlier this month, a portion of the
mountain of garbage at the landfill had collapsed killing two people.

""The Modi government has also sanctioned thousands of crores of rupees for the
Dhaulakuan-Jaipur, Mukarba Chowk-Panipat roads, Dwarka Expressway and North-
West corridor,"" Mr Gadkari said.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari praised PM Modi for the Centre's stand on the
Dokalam issue, on Triple Talaq and on action against separatists in Kashmir.

He hit out against the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi accusing it of
""scams"".

""While the Modi government is not only ruling but also endeavouring for social
transformation, the Kejriwal government in Delhi is indulging in scams. The
fresh example is the Mohalla Clinic,"" Mr Tiwari said.

The party workers and leaders were also addressed by the BJP's national
general secretaries Anil Jain and Ramlal. ""The next two years are crucial for
strengthening people's faith in the (PM) Modi government,"" Mr Ramlal said.

A political resolution passed by the executive of the Delhi unit ""condemned""
the Kejriwal government on 21 issues and also hit out at the Congress for
allegedly ""misguiding"" Delhi's people on various issues.

Union minister Vijay Goel, national vice president Shyam Jaju, senior party
leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra, BJP lawmakers Meenakshi Lekhi, Ramesh Bidhuri,
and Maheish Girri, and Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta,
were also present at the meeting.

**View: How Japan, India missed a great opportunity to keep China in check** 

 ______ 
The 12th India-Japan annual bilateral summit — and fourth between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe — held in Gandhinagar on September 14, 2017, has marked some further progress in their 'special strategic and global partnership'. The summit showcased PM Modi's unprecedented personal diplomacy and his extraordinary rapport with the Japanese leader.The summit was held against the backdrop of China's ""historical"" claims, unilateral assertions and military expansion which are destabilising Asia. No one knows this better than India and Japan. Amid uncertainties about US engagement with Asia as a long-standing resident power, both Modi and Abe have invested in their respective relations with US President Donald Trump However, it is clear that going forward, India and Japan will need to make much greater contributions towards Asia's stable balances and multipolarity. Only their combined strategic weight, economic heft and credible military power can help moderate Chinese behaviour and promote a rulesbased order in the Indo-Pacific. In this context, it is disappointing that the summit failed to mark any significant progress.In their joint statement, the two leaders affirmed commitment to their ""values-based partnership in achieving a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific region where sovereignty and international law are respected, and differences are resolved through dialogue, and where all countries, large or small"", enjoy freedoms of the global commons, development and trade.In order to play a central role in such a rules-based order, they also agreed to align Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy with India's Act East Policy, as well as to enhance defence and security cooperation. In terms of specifics, however, there was no major breakthrough on progressing defence relations beyond additional training exercises.Bilateral cooperation on defence equipment and technology remains just a work in progress. After four years, Japan's offer of the US-2 amphibian aircraft is still under negotiation. In the absence of a much more robust defence relationship, there are little prospects for an India-Japan ""quasi-alliance"".On regional and global challenges, the summit witnessed closer alignment on the respective neighbourhood concerns of India and Japan, from North Korea to cross-border terrorism. There was also a strong endorsement of Asean's unity and its centrality to regional architecture.References to other issues, including trilateral cooperation with the US and Australia, were anodyne. The summit saw considerable focus on joint efforts to enhance connectivityin India and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including Africa.A transparent and non-exclusive approach towards connectivity initiatives based on international standards was reaffirmed. However, the main outcome was a decision to invigorate connectivity initiatives in India's northeast through the setting up of a Japan-India Act East Forum.Japan is today unquestionably India's preeminent economic partner. For PM Modi as a committed moderniser of India's social and economic landscape, the inauguration of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high speed rail project carries special significance in the building of a 'New India'. The project will lead to a quantum jump in technology, skills and domestic capacity at the highest end of manufacturing.Operationalising the now ratified India-Japan civil nuclear cooperation agreement can bring similar inputs into India's energy sector. It is evident that domestic constraints and limitations are now becoming a dampening factor in advancing India-Japan strategic and defence ties.In Japan, even with PM Abe at the helm, a combination of alliance fixations and pacifist public pressures weigh down heavily on bureaucratic decision-making. In India, the defence bureaucracy is simply failing to prioritise strategic decision-making over process and procedure.With PM Abe's political fortunes somewhat subdued and PM Modi facing elections in 2019, it would appear that political caution on both sides has begun to manifest itself. In terms of the warmth of interactions and mutual trust, this latest summit was quite remarkable. In the post-Dokalam environment, however, it was also an opportunity missed.

**Maharashtra: 3 years on, still no decision on new Lokayukta Act** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 A strong anti-corruption body was a poll promise of both Centre and state govt.

2 But, even after almost 3 years, Maharashtra govt has not taken any decision to implement the Lokayukta 2013 Act.

3 Even, Anna Hazare had expressed disappointment over PM Modi govt's failure to implement the Lokpal Act-2013.

A strong anti-corruption body was a poll promise of both the governments in Centre and state. Unfortunately, it's been almost 3 years now, and it seems the BJP-Sena government has cheated the public at large by turning its back over the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act 2013.

State governments were supposed to either implement a new Lokayukta Act as per 2013 Act or amend the existing Lokayukta Act and make it independent and effective like the 2013 Act.

Although as per information received under RTI by Mumbai-based activist Jeetndra Ghadge, the Maharashtra government has not taken any decision to implement the 2013 Act. Maharashtra government has not even decided whether to amend the existing Act or make a new one, it's taking shelter in Section 63 of the Act which mentions one-year deadline for states with no Lokayukta and no mention of any deadline for the states which already have a Lokayukta.

Incidentally, Delhi government has passed its Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill 2015, but Centre-State politics has made sure it does not see the light of the day.

Following are recent figures of complaint received by existing Lokayukta from 1/1/2015 till 31/5/2017:

Pending complaints - 3,982

Complaints received - 13,477

Complaints available for action - 17,459

Complaints closed - 13,474

Pending - 3,985

Action recommended - 158

Action taken report received - 144S

Special report for in-action by govt - 642

In August last week, anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare had expressed disappointment over Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's failure to implement the Lokpal Act-2013 and has warned of an agitation in Delhi to press for the implementation of the Act. Hazare had also written a letter to PM Modi in this regard.

""Government should understand the importance of Lokayukta and Lokpal and implement this as early as possible. So that independent inquires can take place against corruption,"" said Jeetndra Ghadge, RTI activist.

**Demonetisation proving its critics wrong; here are 5 reasons why** 

 ______ 
Demonetisation was mainly aimed to put a check on black money which was circulating in the economy. (IE)

Almost nine months back when PM Narendra Modi took the historic decision to demonetise the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, the government had to bear the criticism of not only the Opposition but the nation as well. Now, when the Reserve Bank has come up with its latest figures, the result clearly shows that the decision was in the interest of the common man, says Anil Baluni in a column for Indian Express. Demonetisation was mainly aimed to put a check on black money which was circulating in the economy. Despite being regarded as an economic revolution by the world, critics conveniently ignored what demonetisation was capable of and called it an immature decision by the government. Not even a year has passed but Modi government’s ‘notebandi’ decision has already started bearing fruits. Here are five reasons why it can’t be ignored that ‘notebandi’ is a boon for India:

According to RBI’s latest figures, lakhs of fraud transaction are already under scrutiny. Not only this, over three lakh shell companies have been unearthed and 2.1 lakh companies have been deregistered due to irregularities, Indian Express reported. 1,150 companies involved in money laundering cases have been caught and Rs 13,300 crore has been recovered.



Since the implementation of demonetisation, Narendra Modi has been pitching for a cashless economy. RBI has collected 99 per cent of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes made defunct on November 8, 2016, which amounts to Rs 15.28 lakh crore approximately.

**Opinion: Wrong To Attack Modi On High Petrol Prices** 

 ______ 
It's a constant puzzle to me that so many of the critics of the Narendra Modi
government - including, in fact led by, the Congress party - want to blame it
for some of the few things it does right on the economy. The current attack on
the government's pricing policy for petroleum products such as petrol is
Exhibit A here as far as I'm concerned. India's kept on hiking these prices --
in some major cities, a litre of petrol now costs around Rs 75. People
complain that this is unconscionable when oil is hovering around $50 a barrel,
give or take $5; back in the bad old days of UPA-2 and May 2013, when a barrel
of oil cost between $110 and $120, and the rupee was 55 to a dollar and not
64, petrol prices were around Rs 64 a litre. Surely, the Congress says, this
is fraud on the people?

Well, only as far as all taxes are fraud. Petrol was a lot cheaper than it
should have been back then, and the difference was being paid for by the
government - in other words, by us again, except through our taxes. What we
couldn't pay for - unsurprisingly, because the fuel subsidy bill was over Rs 1
lakh crore - was being postponed for later; the fiscal deficit, the difference
between what the government was spending and what it was collecting through
taxes and so on, was dangerously high. And a high fiscal deficit leads usually
to higher prices - so the fuel subsidy that ensured relatively cheap petrol
and diesel was also one of the reasons for the runaway inflation that everyone
complained about incessantly in those years.

To give the UPA some credit, after the shock ""Taper tantrum"" of summer 2013
when the rupee lost a lot of its value and some began to worry we were on the
brink of a 1989-like crisis, it began to correct this problem. P Chidambaram
laid out a fiscal deficit reduction path, and the government agreed on a
gradual reduction of fuel subsidies. And when Narendra Modi and Arun Jaitley
took over in May 2014, they very correctly continued this policy, and quite
typically, took full credit for thinking it up as well. (Typically because it
reflects exactly how they operated when it comes to, among others, GST, no-
frills bank accounts, and Aadhaar.)

Modi benefited massively from continuing this policy because the moment he
came into office in May 2014, global oil prices began to crash. (You guessed
it, the PM somehow managed to take credit for this as well.) This meant that
the government could raise prices at the pump or keep them about the same,
while soaking up ever more revenue from taxes on petrol. It is those taxes
that have paid for the government's expenditure, and its ability to keep on
meeting Chidambaram's fiscal deficit targets. In other words, the government's
constant declaration that it has stabilised the foundering economy that it
inherited is based almost entirely on its fuel price bonanza. High taxes on
petrol are an important component of its macro-economic strategy.

And, to be clear, a high price for fossil fuel-based energy is a sensible,
forward-looking policy. We should use less and less fossil fuels going
forward; they're bad for global warming, and they're bad for public health.
The best way to ensure this is to tax them. As Chief Economic Advisor Arvind
Subramanian has often argued, India is doing more than its share for climate
change since it has one of the world's highest proportion of taxes on carbon
emissions when its per capita income is taken into account. The government
should be proud of its policy here, not ashamed.

But, equally typically, the government is unsure of how it should deal with
this. Are they a government of forward-looking reformists who know how to deal
with climate change, the fiscal deficit, and fossil fuels? Or are they blatant
populists whose hand is being forced by global factors? If you listen to
Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan - not to mention the BJP's lumpen
internet warriors - you would think it's the latter. The BJP IT cell convenor,
Amit Malviya, released a long apologia on Twitter for higher petrol prices
blaming them, in succession, on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the United
States, state governments (of which you'd think the BJP ran perhaps one or
two, instead of almost all), and the flawed structure of the GST.

The question is: will the government stand firm? If it gives in and starts
reducing taxes on petrol -- or, worst of all, starts subsidising it from the
exchequer again -- it will risk destabilising the economy and loses one of its
bragging rights as compared to the UPA, the only thing it really cares about
anyway. On the other hand, if it ignores the grumbling about petrol prices, it
may fear it will pay a political price.

But, to be frank, anyone who actually pays for their own petrol is probably
voting for Modi anyway in 2019. Pradhan, the BJP's IT cell, and so on, should
just ignore the complaining. Better still, they should instead make the
argument that high petrol taxes are important to India, and important to
India's future.

**The dangers of India’s Billionaire Raj** 

 ______ 
Thomas Piketty and Lucas Chancel’s paper on income inequality in India shows that share of national income taken by the top 1% of Indian income earners is now at its highest level since records began in 1922. Photo: iStockphoto

Speaking from the ramparts of Red Fort in New Delhi last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at pains to put fairness at the heart of his political agenda. He promised “a New India, where there is equal opportunity for all” by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence. But on the most important indicator of this agenda—income inequality itself—the country is slipping dangerously backwards.

This conclusion is inescapable from a paper published last week by the celebrated French economist Thomas Piketty, along with his co-author Lucas Chancel. Its conclusion is striking. The share of national income taken by the top 1% of Indian income earners is now at its highest level since records began, when the British Raj began collecting income tax records in 1922.

Piketty’s new Indian data suggests a pattern that is worryingly familiar from his opus Capital, which warned of galloping inequality in the industrialized world. In the West, the relative wealth of the ultra-rich dipped in the mid-20th century before bouncing back in the last two decades. India now shows the same trend, albeit mostly for different reasons.

Piketty and Chancel’s evidence is comprehensive, but far from unique. International Monetary Fund (IMF) research last year showed India, alongside China, to be the most unequal major economy in Asia. A recent study by Credit Suisse, the investment bank, suggested that India’s 1% now own a staggering 58% of national wealth—one of the world’s highest rates, and akin to notoriously stratified nations like South Africa and Brazil.

The same is true at the very, very top. Harvard’s Michael Walton has shown that India has an unusually high proportion of national wealth held by its swelling ranks of billionaires. Piketty’s paper broadly supports this view, showing that the share of income held by the “0.001%” has also increased rapidly. The paper’s subtitle poses a question: Is India becoming a “Billionaire Raj?” In truth, the evidence for this is now overwhelming. The question should be: why does it matter, and what can be done about it?

Over recent decades India laboured under the misapprehension that it was an oddly egalitarian nation. This was partly a hangover from the socialist era, when the rich still lived modestly by global standards. There were no Indians on Forbes annual billionaire rankings until the mid-1990s (now there are well over 100, more than in any other country bar America, China and Russia). There were methodological issues too, namely that research often focused on consumption rather than income or wealth, giving a false picture of inequality.

Beneath this there lay a peculiar intellectual consensus. On the right, thinkers like economist Jagdish Bhagwati argued that rapid growth mattered more than its distribution. But even on the left, Bhagwati’s rival Amartya Sen focused more on conditions at the bottom, and the fact that economic expansion had failed to boost indicators of human development. For both, the gap between rich and poor was a secondary concern.

There was a logic to Sen’s argument. Almost all successful economies in East Asia have grown rich by investing heavily in basic health and education, which helps poorer workers to move from farms to factories. Modern India more often looks like a Latin American economy, with a weak social safety net but yawning inequality.

There are good reasons to be worried about this gap too. Mainstream economists often used to be relaxed about inequality, arguing that it at least did little to harm growth. But more recent research, much of it again from the IMF, has overturned this consensus, showing that unequal nations tend to grow more slowly and are more prone to financial instability. Unequal countries also find it harder to form the kind of social consensus needed for structural economic reforms, a point made by Harvard’s Dani Rodrik.

The reasons for Indian inequality are complicated. Some of it stems from positive factors linked to liberalization, like entrepreneurs building large companies linked to global markets. Factors such as rising urbanization and increasing returns to education also play a role. Many countries become less equal as they industrialize, only to reverse that trend later.

Still, India appears to be growing unequal more quickly and more starkly than most, a trend that will be hard to reverse later. It is also hard not to conclude that poor public policy, along with problems of corruption and cronyism, are partly to blame.

It also leaves a dilemma. The gap between rich and poor is likely to grow if Modi ever succeeds in his ambition of hitting double-digit growth rates. Certainly, this was what happened during the 2007 boom, a period when India’s billionaire wealth rivalled Russia, and Reliance Industries’ chairman Mukesh Ambani was briefly thought to be the richest man in the world.

Fixing this problem, so growth is more broadly shared, will be complicated. But there are obvious places to start, not least tax collection, in a country where an improbably tiny 48,000 people admitted to earning more than Rs1 crore in 2015. Beyond this a far more radical agenda is needed, to improve basic social services at the bottom, while using competition policy and regulation to stamp out crony capitalism and entrenched corporate power at the top.

For all of his talk of fairness, Modi is doing little of this. If he does not change course, the Billionaire Raj is only going to grow stronger.

James Crabtree is a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, and a former Mumbai Bureau chief for the Financial Times. His book on India, The Billionaire Raj, will be published in mid-2018 by Random House and One World.

**Google’s big move in India, may start Paytm like payments service next week: How it will work** 

 ______ 
Google will reportedly start a payments service similar to Paytm and Bhim in India. (Reuters)

Google, with an aim to target the Indian user, has reportedly decided to introduce a new payment service called ‘Tez’ in the country. According to a report in The Ken, the tech giant will start a payments service similar to Paytm and Bhim in India. The report says that the service will be available from September 18. It is interesting to note that Google already has two similar features available, that includes Android Pay and Google Wallet. However, Google Tez will support Unified Payments Interface. UPI is a payment system supported by the Indian government. It is backed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. Users will be able to transfer funds instantly between two bank accounts using just a smartphone. Meanwhile, TechCrunch said that Google has declined to comment on the move.

This move by Google, to introduce a UPI based payments service is a major deal since it has not really expanded into the segment, other than the US. After the demonetisation move by PM Narendra Modi in 2016, where the government pushed for a digital economy by banning high-value currencies, there has been a massive surge in the online payments sector. From WhatsApp to Flipkart, all major tech majors have shown interest in getting a UPI based payments system in India. But if Google actually ventures into this space, it will be a huge move since it has a strong consumer presence in the country. With a growing internet user base and a surge in data usage in the country, Google’s move can be a masterstroke.

Google brings new Feed in India: Here’s what will change in your smartphones

In the report in The Ken says that there are government filings which indicate Google’s plans to roll out a product called Tez in India. It cited Google Inc’s application for ‘Tez’ in the Controller General of Patents, Design and Trademarks. The report adds that it may also expand to countries like Philippines and Indonesia as it has the same trademarks there too.

Google has been making a series of moves to expand its market in India, especially with its new Next Billion Users (NBU) program. Latest moves by Google in the country, include WiFi at major railway stations, YouTube Lite, Android Go and Android One.

Not only the second UPA era gave rise to numerous scams, but also made a sloth in the economy, raised our corruption perception worldwide and in general, brought much trouble which effected middle class like us directly. 

Remember 10% inflation rates? Remember a new scam unearthing every month. Those things are history atleast for now. 

For a common man, as much as we hate it, **corruption effects him more than communal tensions**. You may have a communal incident once a week or once a month. But crime statistics wise they are miniscule (not justifying/supporting any communal activity here). 

Inflation and corruption directly effects people - you will need to interact with some govt official sometime in your life, you well I need to buy commodities and food to survive. Communal incidents are rather unfortunate events which can be avoided and controlled if we want it. 

Other issues that people raise here - GST, Bullet Train, Aadhar, RERA, Jan Dhan, Cashless etc - people need to realise that these are the steps we need to take sooner or later in order to develop. 

**Any nation needs to have a single national tax instead of madrid of taxes. Any nation as big as India needs a single citizen identity. Any nation needs to have real estate regulated. Any nation as big as India needs faster and hassle free transport. We need to bring poor people in banking finance to give them financial benefits. We need to find ways to use cashless methods for hassle free economic activities. **

If you want to improve them - fight for their right implementation, **not the ideas**. Make the govt responsible for Aadhaar privacy. Find solutions to make GST filing hassle free. See how you can have a regulated real estate that's beneficial to both home buyers and builders. 

The above idea can be extended to demonitisation too. As much as we want, many people are not ready to believe that PM Modi carried out demonitisation for his own personal benefits. That doesn't sell. His stature in the eyes of the people are even higher than that. It was a botched execution, many people agree with that, but not that his intent was wrong. 

Then there are issues that are handled well - in foreign relations for example. Now people can dismiss India's diplomatic victory over China as a chest thumping and hypernationalism for bhakts, but in today's world, incidents like these effect economics as well. We are not a pushover nation anymore, we can guard our interests well. This also gives rise to economics perception and more $$$ and investments, thus lifting more people out of poverty.

**475 VIPs Get Special Security Now, Highest Ever, Up From 350 Earlier**

PM Narendra Modi's government has granted VIP security to over 140 more people
than earlier.

**New Delhi: **

The Narendra Modi government gives special security, seen by many to signal
VIP status, to 475 people, compared to the 350 protected by the previous
Congress-led government. The Union Home Ministry's current list is an all-time
high despite PM Modi's firm drive against a VIP culture, and includes
political leaders, their children and also priests and spiritual teachers.

Senior officers said the list will be up for review soon and could be
rationalised. ""Some of these netas are being provided security by NSG and also
the paramilitary so some of them will lose their NSG cover,"" a senior ministry
official said.

Bihar politician Lalu Yadav who is guarded by both the elite National Security
Guard (NSG) and the paramilitary CRPF, is no more a lawmaker and rarely moves
out of his state now and his security is being reviewed, sources said, as is
that for former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Chhattisgarh
Chief Minister Raman Singh of the BJP. Also M Karunanidhi, the 93-year-old
leader of Tamil Nadu party the DMK, who is ill and barely moves out of his
home.

Lalu Yadav is among politicians guarded by the elite National Security Guard
or NSG.

All these politicians currently have the highest Z plus security, which the
government gives to 50 people, each guarded by 35 to 40 security personnel at
any given time. The previous government had a list of 26.

Removing or scaling down security is easier said than done, sources said, with
political pressure every time there is such a move. An officer said there are
also many complaints that VIPs misbehave with the security staff.

Special security is provided by the Centre and state governments under several
categories ranging from X to Z plus based on a threat perception that the
government assesses from time to time; the difference is in the number of
security personnel that protect the person. People with Z category security
get 30 guards, while people with Y Plus security get 11.

The government says VIPs get security based on threat perception.

So 30 policemen and paramilitary personnel are assigned for yoga teacher Baba
Ramdev's security. Spiritual leader Mata Aamritanandamayi too gets Z security,
while Mahant Nrityagopal Das, who is also the chairman of the Ram Janmabhoomi
Shrine Board gets Y security. Even controversial lawmaker Sakshi Maharaj is
protected under the Y category.

In addition, many people are given an NSG guard, including the children of at
least 15 politicians, including union Home Minister Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj
Singh, who is a first-time lawmaker.

Uttar Pradesh has the most VIPs with special protection, including Chief
Minister Yogi Adityanath, former Chief Ministers Mulayam Singh Yadav and his
son Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party leader
Mayawati.

Baba Ramdev gets 30 policemen for his security. (File)

NSG officials say that at least 15 politicians are guarded by its black cat
commandos, including Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal. The government
had withdrawn the NSG from the Assam chief minister's security detail when the
Congress' Tarun Gogoi held the post, but restored it when Mr Sonowal of the
BJP took over.

The CRPF protects almost 75 VVIPS, BJP President Amit Shah and Minister of
Road and Transport Nitin Gadkari, the CISF guards 75, including national
security adviser Ajit Doval and Minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju, while
the ITBP is assigned to protect 18, including Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister
Mehbooba Mufti and her predecessor Omar Abdullah.

Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest man pays for Z category security for
himself, and Y category for his wife Neeta Ambani.

**Bullet train should run between Delhi, Kolkata: Akhilesh Yadav** 

 ______ 
LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav today said the Narendra Modi government should have launched the bullet train project for New Delhi-Kolkata route.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe today launched India's first bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said they have initiated the bullet train project. It's very costly. The fare will be known only when it gets started.

""In my opinion, it should have been between New Delhi and Kolkata passing through Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which have maximum number of unemployed and poor,"" Yadav said.

The former UP chief minister's comments came hours after the launch of the ambitious Rs 1.10 lakh crore Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project which will cut travel time between the two cities from seven hours to less than three.

The project, covering the 508-km stretch, is expected to be completed by 2022.

**Bihar students write to PM Modi against decision to make IIT-JEE Advanced test online** 

 ______ 
Students from Bihar have sought the intervention of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rescind the decision to conduct the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Advanced for admission to prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) online from next year.

The Joint Admission Board (JAB), responsible for laying down the policy for the examination, took the decision in August to conduct the exam online in order to make logistics and evaluations easier.

Pankaj Kumar Kapadia, an alumnus of IIT-Delhi, who is leading the protest, sent an email to the Prime Minister’s Office on Tuesday. He also tweeted their concern by tagging the Prime Minister and Union human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar on August 23.

The students feel that many meritorious students from rural India, especially Bihar and other less developed states, would be at a grossly disadvantageous position if the exam is conducted online because they are not computer savvy.

Demanding a level playing field for all students, they argued the government should first make computers available in rural schools before making the test online.

The students have already written to the Union HRD minister and to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on September 8 urging the later to take up the issue with the Centre.

“Already grappling to overcome the English language barrier, many of us who had earlier not even touched the mouse of a computer will now have to write the exam on a computer. It is like eliminating them in the very beginning. They deserve the right to equality,” Kapadia, the son of a cloth merchant from Nasriganj block in Rohtas district, said.

Kapadia, a student of Super-30, took admission at IIT Delhi in 2006 to study chemical engineering.

He cited another example of the son of a Muzaffarpur-based marginalised farmer and rickshaw puller, Rahul Kumar, who knew neither English nor computers but made it to IIT Bombay in his first attempt last year.

The government earlier made it optional to take the JEE-Mains test online. Of the 118,600 lakh candidates who registered for JEE Mains 2017, only 165,000 took the exam online and 956,000 opted for the conventional pen and paper based exam.

Students vying for admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and other centrally-funded technical institutions need to clear the JEE-Mains. Only the top few who clear the JEE-Mains qualify for the next level of JEE-Advanced.

More than 150,000 students took the JEE Advanced in 2017.

**Talk of berth in Modi cabinet bid to project Supriya Sule as NCP face?** 

 ______ 
Reports that NCP MP Supriya Sule turned down PM Narendra Modi’s offer to join the NDA as a minister have sparked speculation that she is being projected as the new face of the party her father, Sharad Pawar, founded.

The buzz in political circles in Maharashtra is that Sule could be asked to take up the responsibility as most of the first-rung leaders of the party are facing serious corruption charges.

In his column in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday, that party’s MP Sanjay Raut had quoted Pawar as telling him about meeting Modi and discussing the offer. Raut claimed that Sule, who was also present at the meeting, said she would be the last person to go with the BJP.Sule has rubbished Raut’s claim. “There has been no such meeting where I met Mr Modi with Mr Pawar,” said Sule.

The timing of Raut’s comments is crucial as the message was meant to convey that Sule is in charge, say NCP leaders. “Raut is close to the NCP chief and it is not possible for him to disclose such sensitive information without Pawar’s permission, which is also part of a private discussion between them,” said a key NCP leader, who spoke on condition he would not be named.

Political commentator Prakash Bal said Pawar has been trying to put Sule at the helm. “Pawar wants Sule to be the face of the NCP and Ajit Pawar to take administrative responsibility,” Bal told HT.

NCP sources claimed they had got an offer from the BJP but that the leadership was not keen on joining the NDA fold. “The party chief was not keen on joining NDA. Also, Sule was against it. She was the first person to refute rumours of the NCP joining NDA when speculation was rife,” said a senior party leader.

Sources said Sule’s quote used in Raut’s article was enough to clear all speculation that they are joining the NDA. But NCP leaders said the revelation about the offer also means the leadership is trying to achieve more. “It is a clear message to all those thinking about joining the BJP that the NCP is still relevant when it comes to power. Thus, there is no point in switching sides. Further, the party needs a face like Sule,” sources said.

The speculation assumes significance considering the charges NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare are facing in the irrigation scam. Another party senior, Chhagan Bhujbal, is in jail over allegations of corruption.

**BJP MP Nana Patole raps Devendra Fadnavis over farmers crisis** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Gondia Nana Patole once again created a stir on Wednesday by attacking his own party, saying the farmers’ situation has not changed at all, and more farmers had in fact died during the tenure of the Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra than in the previous years.Patole had earlier criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently saying that the latter doesn’t ‘like to be asked questions’, only to retract his statement later.“If a state like Odisha can give MSP to its paddy farmers, then why can’t Maharashtra do so? There was a time when Maharashtra took the lead in such decisions and others followed,” said Patole on Wednesday while speaking to mediapersons.When asked about his criticism against the Fadnavis government’s ‘anti-farmer policies’, the Gondia MP said that he has the right to criticise his ‘friend’.“Fadnavis and myself started our political career at the same time. I consider him a friend, so if he makes mistakes, he should correct them and work for the people,” Patole said. The BJP MP, however, said his statement should not be misconstrued. “I have the right to criticise the policies if they are not benefiting the people. I am not involved in politics,” he said.He also took offence to Maharashtra revenue minister Chandrakant Patil’s statement that 10 lakh bogus farmers have been detected while analysing the online applications for a farm loan waiver.“How can he (Patil) say such a thing: the process for accepting online applications involves farmers giving details of their land records, so how can he say that the farmers were bogus? I will criticise such statements,” he said.

**Addressing India’s income inequality** 

 ______ 
Inequality is a problem that deserves more public attention. Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint

Thomas Piketty has thrown a flaming dart into the Indian economic debate. In a new paper written in collaboration with Lucas Chancel, the superstar French economist has shown that income inequality in India is now at its highest level since income tax was first levied in 1922. The title of the study is suitably eye-catching—Indian Income Inequality 1922-2014: From British Raj To Billionaire Raj. The data here has quite naturally sparked off a lot of excited debate about the nature of Indian economic policy.

Indian inequality data has traditionally been derived from consumer surveys that understate the extent of the problem. Chancel and Piketty have calculated inequality from tax data, national income accounts and sample surveys—a much better method, though the way these disparate data sources have been integrated leads to potential methodological tangles that could lead to an overstatement of the extent of inequality in India. For example, the use of tax data for the top 5% and the use of survey data for the rest of the population assumes that only the top sliver under-reports income. How realistic is that?

The two economists show that income inequality has been rising steadily since Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister. This is not a unique finding. The International Monetary Fund has earlier estimated that the Gini coefficient, a popular measure of inequality, rose from 45 to 51 between 1990 and 2013. The LIS Data Centre in Luxembourg has come to similar conclusions. These are far higher than the official Gini estimate of 37 derived from consumer surveys.

The most obvious conclusion to be drawn is that economic reforms have relatively benefited a tiny group at the top of the Indian income pyramid, though absolute incomes have gone up across deciles since 1980 while the poverty ratio has plummeted. However, the uneven distribution of higher growth needs more public attention.

There are two important lessons to be gleaned from a careful reading of the data that has been released. First, the increase in income inequality coincides with the sharp rise in Indian economic growth after 1980. Also notice the very significant drop in income inequality during the stagnant 1970s. This points to the famous hypothesis put forth by Simon Kuznets—that inequality tends to rise during periods of rapid growth thanks to the uneven pace at which people move from low productivity to high productivity activities. Piketty wrote a sharp critique of the Kuznets hypothesis in Capital In The Twenty-First Century, his wildly popular (but perhaps unread) book. The correlation between economic growth and income inequality since 1965 needs to be worked out in a statistically rigorous manner.

Second, income inequality is not just about the share of national income going to the top 1%. There are deeper distributional issues. A comparison with China tells us a lot. Chancel and Piketty show that the share of national income captured by the bottom half in both India and China after 1980 has been broadly similar. The big difference between the two countries is in the fact that the middle 40% in India got 23% of the increase in national income since 1980 while the same group in China got 43%—a massive gap of 20 percentage points. This difference of 20 percentage points was largely captured by the top 1% in India.

So a stylized view is as follows: The Indian top 1% has done extremely well, the Chinese middle has benefited far more than the Indian middle, and the bottom half in both countries has had broadly similar experiences.

This newspaper believes the answer to this paradox lies in the failure of labour-intensive manufacturing in India compared to its massive success in China. The latter could absorb millions of people who left farming because of the rapid expansion of large enterprises, as was the case in most other successful structural transformations in Asia. India has failed on this front. The proportion of the labour force in agriculture has come down, but the workers who have left farms have not got jobs in modern factories or offices. Most are stuck in tiny informal enterprises with abysmal productivity levels.

There are two major political economy lessons that flow from these trends. First, that a sustainable attack on mass poverty should be focused on job creation in the modern sectors of the economy rather than redistribution through fiscal spending that is eventually destabilizing. Second, widening income inequality weakens public support for liberal economic reforms, as economist Dani Rodrik has shown. Economic populism takes over, as was the case during the tenure of the second United Progressive Alliance government led by Manmohan Singh. The gradual drift of the Narendra Modi government in the direction of populism and interventionism deserves to be seen against this backdrop.

It is also apt to once again underline the historical fact that no country has been able to win the battle against mass poverty without rapid economic growth. China is the latest example. Inequality is a problem that deserves more public attention—but the solution is more inclusive growth rather than misplaced nostalgia for the miserable 1970s.

**CPI (Maoist) denies role, says ‘Brahminical fascist goons’ behind Gauri Lankesh murder** 

 ______ 
“It is their lowly and dirty act to pressure and get her brother to hint at the possibility of Maoist hand in her murder,” said the release issued by CPI (Maoist). “It is their lowly and dirty act to pressure and get her brother to hint at the possibility of Maoist hand in her murder,” said the release issued by CPI (Maoist).

The Communist Party of India (Maoist) has denied any role in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, saying the claim was nothing but “propaganda by Hindu fascist forces when they themselves have killed her to muzzle the voice of pro-people forces”.

A release issued by Abhay, spokesman of the Central Committee of CPI (Maoist), recently, says: “The party strongly condemns the murder of Leftist, pro-people, progressive and democratic journalist Gauri Lankesh by Brahminical fascist goons of Sangh parivar protected by the BJP government at the Centre. The party appeals to all like-minded forces to pour out into the streets for a determined fight against the forces that killed Lankesh.”

Saying that Lankesh fearlessly campaigned for the downtrodden and the marginalised, against atrocities on minorities by Hindutva forces and corrupt governments, the party has stated, “Lankesh had become an eyesore for the Hindutva forces ever since she translated the book Gujarat Files by Gujarat journalist Rana Ayyub, exposing the involvement of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in the Muslim carnage in 2002.”

“She had printed the matter in her publication in Kannada language. The fascist Hindutva hand (in her murder) is evident from the fact that BJP leader D N Yuvraj had said that she would have been alive had she not celebrated the death of RSS people.” The CPI (Maoist) targeted PM Modi for his silence on Lankesh’s murder, which it says was “indicative of the Hindutva hand in her murder”.

“It is their lowly and dirty act to pressure and get her brother to hint at the possibility of Maoist hand in her murder,” the release further says.

The party has rubbished the probe ordered into Lankesh’s killing, saying, “When the rulers themselves are complicit in it, everybody knows what is going to be the outcome of such a probe. That is the reason that till now, there has been no headway in the probe in the murders of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, Leftist thinker Govind Pansare and progressive writer M M Kalburgi.” The party has called for intensifying the struggle against “fascist Hindutva forces” by all progressive and democratic forces beyond “symbolic protests” with “now-or-never” urgency.

**Oppose 'Third Party', Says China on India-Japan's Northeast Plan** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi and Japan PM Shinzo Abe have agreed to deepen strategic ties
(Reuters)

**New Delhi: **

Reacting to Japan's plan to step up investments in the northeastern states in
India, China said it was against the involvement of a ""third party"" in the
region where it has boundary disputes with India.

Keeping in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Act East' policy,
Japanese PM Shinzo Abe - who was in India on a two-day visit earlier this week
- announced increased Japanese investment in infrastructure projects such as
road connectivity and electricity in the northeast, a region New Delhi sees as
a gateway to Southeast Asia. A joint statement issued on Thursday after a
bilateral meeting between the two leaders announced the setting up of the Act
East Forum.

""You also mentioned Act East policy. You must be clear that the boundary of
India and China border area has not been totally delimited. We have disputes
on the eastern section of the boundary,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson
Hua Chunying said.

""We are now trying to seek a solution through negotiations that is acceptable
to both sides. Under such circumstances, various parties should respect such
aspects and any third party should not be involved in our efforts to resolve
the disputes,"" Ms Hua said.

Shinzo Abe's visit came days after New Delhi and Beijing agreed to end the
longest and most serious military confrontation in Doklam, near Sikkim. The
70-day stand-off started in June when India sent troops to stop China building
a road in the Doklam area, a remote, uninhabited territory claimed by both
China and India's ally Bhutan. Delhi says the road is a serious security
concern because it changes the status quo at the tri-junction of the borders
of India, China and Bhutan.

The Chinese spokesperson, however, said there was no mention of China anywhere
in the India-Japan joint statement nor has she seen any ""innuendos"" referred
to Beijing as stated by the media. ""We are also closely following the Japanese
Prime Minister's visit to India. I read the joint statement carefully but I
have not found the statement mentioned the term China at all,"" she said.

The India-Japan joint statement said, ""the two Prime Ministers welcomed the
India-Japan cooperation on development of India's North Eastern Region (NER)
as a concrete symbol of developing synergies between India's Act East policy
and Japan's Free and Open Indo Pacific Strategy.""

""India and Japan are important countries in Asia. We hope the normal
development of the relationship can be conducive to regional, peace and
development and play a constructive role in this process,"" the Chinese
spokesperson said.

In an indirect reference to Japan, Hua said, ""We also hope various parties can
uphold the rights to freedom of navigation of over flights by countries in
various waters."" China and Japan have a dispute over the uninhabited islands
called Senkakus by Japan and Diaoyu islands by China in the East China Sea
where naval ships of both the countries aggressively patrol the waters around
the islands.

Relations have deepened between India and Japan - Asia's second and third
largest economies - as Mr Abe and PM Modi, who enjoy a close personal
relationship, increasingly see eye-to-eye to balance China as the dominant
Asian power.

Expressing dissatisfaction over proposed Japanese investments in India’s North-East states, as mentioned in the India-Japan joint statement following bilateral talks a day earlier between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe in Gandhinagar, Beijing Friday warned that a “third-party should not meddle” in border disputes between India and China. Without mentioning Arunachal Pradesh, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that negotiations were still on to settle the “eastern section” of the China-India border.

Referring to the India-Japan Act East Forum, MFA spokesperson Hua Chunying said, “China and India are working on seeking a fair and reasonable settlement which can be accepted by both sides through negotiations. Under such circumstances, we believe that any third party should respect the efforts made by China and India to settle the disputes through negotiations and any third party should not meddle in the disputes between China and India over territorial sovereignty in any form.”

Hua said the boundary between India and China was yet to be settled: “There are disputes over the eastern section of the China-India boundary. China’s position on the boundary issue is consistent… I want to add that both Japan and India are important countries in Asia. We hope that the development of normal relations between Japan and India can play a constructive role for the mutual trust and cooperation between regional countries and the peace, stability and development of the region.”

The India-Japan joint statement mentioned cooperation between the two countries to improve infrastructure and development in the North-East region. Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar said: “We agreed on a Japan-India Act East Forum which will essentially the explore the possibilities of involving Japan in the development of North East infrastructure.”

Asked about possible allusions to China in the joint statement, Hua said, “I have also read the Japan-India joint statement… I have not found the word ‘China’ in the statement. So, I am wondering whether this is the overinterpretation of the media or just like the media’s conjecture, both Japan and India have the hidden agenda. As far as I am concerned, it is better to ask Japan and India and see whether they can make some clarifications on this.”

**Shinzo Abe’s visit puts spotlight on bullet train, renewable energy**

New Delhi: With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit underway, Japan’s engagement with India on the infrastructure front is expected to broaden and deepen with a focus on connectivity and renewable energy.

Apart from the marque projects such as the high-speed rail, popularly known as the bullet train, and the western dedicated freight corridor, Japan has also joined hands with India to aggressively develop infrastructure projects in India’s north-eastern states as part of the strategy to contain China.

To take this engagement forward in a structured manner, an India-Japan coordination forum for development of North East has been set up to focus on strategic projects such as connectivity and road network development, electricity and disaster management, Mint reported on 3 August.

“This forum is an important engagement for us, given the immense strategic importance of the region,” said an Indian government official, requesting anonymity.

The development also assumes importance given that several multilateral lending agencies, including the World Bank, have been unwilling to fund projects in the so-called disputed border states in India’s northeastern region—seen as sensitive as parts of the region are claimed by China.

Analysts say that there are strong synergies between the two nations.

“With an aim to consolidate its clout within Asia and beyond, Japan has been aggressively pursuing the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure in Asia (PQI) initiative. This was essentially meant as a counter to China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. There are strong synergies between PQI and India’s Act-East policy,” said Kannan Sivasubramanian, co-chief executive officer at Aranca, a research and advisory firm.

India has been critical of China developing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of the OBOR infrastructure initiative cutting through Gilgit and Baltistan areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). OBOR, first unveiled by Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to put billions of dollars in infrastructure projects, including railways, ports and power grids across Asia, Africa and Europe.

The two countries are also leveraging their association to set up large infrastructure projects in India’s neighbourhood with state-run Petronet LNG Ltd’s plan of setting up a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Sri Lanka with Indian and Japanese firms.

Japan is also expected to help India strengthen its role in the proposed transportation architecture in the region and beyond in projects such as the Great Asian Highway, connecting 32 Asian countries, the South Asian Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) road connectivity programme and the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor.

“Such improving bilateral ties between India and Japan are likely to help both countries achieve their economic goals and strategic aims in the Asian region,” added Sivasubramanian.

India needs funds and technology to push its new integrated infrastructure programme which involves building of roads, railways, waterways and airports.

A case in point being its Sagarmala and Bharatmala programme with an investment requirement of Rs10 trillion and Rs8 trillion respectively.

With Indian state government entities recently allowed to directly tap bilateral agencies for resources, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority is availing a Rs15,109 crore loan directly from the Japan International Cooperation Agency for the Mumbai trans-harbour link project.

Apart from cheap finance, Japanese technology is also an added attraction.

“The rate of interest given by the Japanese financial institutions is frightfully attractive. Even with the tied loans, the technology they are bringing in adds to the advantage,” said Sanjay Garg, partner and leader, capital projects, at PwC.

Japanese investment has also played an important role in India’s clean energy industry, given the focus on so-called patient capital, which seeks modest yields over time.

A raft of Japanese firms have been investing in India’s clean energy sector. While JERA Co. Inc bought a 10% stake in ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd for $200 million, SBG Cleantech, a joint venture between Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., India’s Bharti Enterprises Ltd and Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group, has also been placing aggressive solar power bids, helping bring down solar tariffs in India.

**‘If Taslima Nasreen can become Modi’s sister, why can’t Rohingyas become his brothers?’: Owaisi** 

 ______ 
Citing example of refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka residing in India, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday tore into Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government over sending the Rohingya Muslims back to Myanmar, saying that Rohingya refugees should be allowed to take shelter in the country just like other refugees are.

Owaisi also mentioned about the noted Bangladeshi writer, Taslima Nasreen, who has been living in India in exile since 1994 and asserted that if the former can be the sister of Prime Minister Modi, why can’t Rohingyas be his ‘brothers’.

“If Taslima Nasreen can stay here, why can’t Rohingyas? If Taslima can be the prime minister’s sister, can’t Rohingyas become his brothers?” Owaisi said, while addressing a gathering here.

“Is this humanity to send those people back who have lost everything? This is wrong. Under which law, can the Centre send all the Rohingya refugees back?” he added.

He even questioned India’s wish to get a permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council.

“The Indian Government wants a permanent membership in the UN Security Council. Will this be there attitude as a super power? Can the Centre send those Muslims back, who even have the permission of the Human Rights Council to stay here?” Owaisi said.

Further referring to the Sri Lankan refugees staying in Tamil Nadu, Owaisi said that they were allowed to stay in India even after being accused of spreading terrorism.

He even mentioned about the Chakma people of Bangladesh, who came to India in 1971 and have been living in Arunachal Pradesh, and Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who is treated as a guest in India.

“Isn’t a refugee staying in the camps of Tamil Nadu, even when it was claimed that these refugees are involved in spreading terrorism? Why were they not sent back to Sri Lanka? After the formation of Bangladesh, the Chakmas came to India, and got the status of refugees,” he said.

Owaisi even requested the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Government to not see Rohingyas as Muslims, but to consider them are refugees.

“We hope that the government of India gives shelter, an opportunity to live a respectful life and a future to their children, because the Indian Constitution gives the Right to Equality and the Right to Life, not only to its own citizens, but to all refugees as well,” he said.

Meanwhile, India has sent the first consignment of humanitarian assistance to Dhaka, in response to the humanitarian crisis being faced on account of the large influx of refugees into Bangladesh.

This development came days after Bangladesh briefed India about the problems faced by it due to the influx of refugees from Myanmar following the ethnic violence in the Buddhist-majority nation.

As per reports, on August 9, the government had told the Parliament that according to available data, more than 14,000 Rohingyas, registered with the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR, are presently staying in India.

The UNHCR had said that at least 2,70,000 Rohingya refugees have fled from the violence-affected Myanmar’s Northern Rakhine state and sought refuge in Bangladesh where the limited shelter capacity is already exhausted.

**An India where knowledge is free** 

 ______ 
Today, nearly 74 per cent of India’s population has basic literacy skills. (Representational Image) Today, nearly 74 per cent of India’s population has basic literacy skills. (Representational Image)

As India joins the rest of the world in celebrating the 51st International Literacy Day today, I would like to emphasise the important role of literacy in the development architecture of all countries and its crucial role as a development accelerator. It is a day when we recollect our freedom struggle and the words of Mahatma Gandhi who called mass illiteracy a sin and a shame that must be eradicated. It is a day when we reflect on our progress over the last 70 years and evaluate our progress in achieving the goals put forth eloquently by Jawaharlal Nehru on the midnight of August 15, 1947: “To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman”.

As we take stock of our achievements over the years, we can look back with pride at the many milestones we have crossed. Only 18 per cent of our population could read and write in 1947. Today, nearly 74 per cent of our population has basic literacy skills. Over 95 per cent of the country’s children are in school and nearly 86 per cent of young people are functionally literate. This is not a small achievement. However, we have to draw inspiration from our past successes and move forward.

We cannot ignore the fact that today nearly 35 crore youth and adults are outside the world of literates and are unable to participate effectively in the development of the country. About 40 per cent of our schoolchildren do not acquire literacy skills with satisfactory proficiency even after completing elementary education. We have a formidable challenge that needs to be recognised and systematically addressed.

We have an opportunity today to celebrate our collective achievements. Many individuals and institutions have contributed to this national effort. The enlightened rulers of Travancore and Baroda expanded education opportunities. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Welthy Fisher and Frank Laubach set up the Literacy House in Lucknow in 1953. There were active campaigns for adult literacy like the Grama Shikshan Mohim in 1959. Excellent momentum was generated through the 1990s by the Government of India’s National Literacy Mission.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated the current government’s credo at the BRICS conference in Xiamen, China on September 5. “The bedrock of our development agenda lies in the notion of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,” he said. The country is embarking on a faster development trajectory to shape a new India in the next five years. Globally, we have committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agenda envisages a “world with universal literacy”. Target 4.6 of the Sustainable Development Goals is: “By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy”.

If India has to ensure that all youth, and a substantial proportion of adults, acquire these skills, we may need to review our past strategies in light of today’s requirements. We need to learn from successful examples from within the country and outside it. We may have to chalk out new ways to reach out to learners who have not been reached till now. This has to be a collective effort: The government has to lead the process but the civil society and the private sector should also play key roles.

I recall the words of the Telugu poet Gurajada Apparao, “Deshamante matti kaadoy, deshamante manushuloi” (The country is not the land under our feet but it is the people who live on the land). The government of India is committed to inclusive growth. That is the underlying guiding principle of “sabka vikas”. Literacy is the first step towards building a participatory, vibrant and more inclusive democracy. It helps individuals to access and exercise the various rights and entitlements provided to them under the Constitution. Problems like poverty, infant mortality, population growth and gender inequality are better resolved in a literate society. Literacy enables individuals to access economic, political and social benefits. In India, literacy can play an important role in empowering people as well as improving their quality of life — especially of women and those belonging to the disadvantaged groups of society.

We should continue to strive for universal literacy through the two-pronged approach that we have been following. First, we must improve the quality of pre-primary and school education to ensure that all children graduating from school have the necessary literacy skills. Second, we must provide opportunities for learning to those who have never been to a school or have dropped out, and also to the young people and adults who need to acquire basic skills to expand their livelihood opportunities.

The Saakshar Bharat Programme and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan are the government’s key policy instruments in the realm of improving literacy. The Saakshar Bharat Programme focuses primarily on rural areas in low-female literacy districts. The initiative has helped in the establishment of an institutional framework that promotes adult education centres up to the gram panchayat level. I am glad that the focus has been on female literacy because of its potential multiplier effects, including better health outcomes and improvement of nutritional status.

Today, more than a crore adult learners appear for the bi-annual Learners Assessment Tests held across the country. Around 6.66 crore learners have passed the assessment test conducted by the National Institute of Open Schooling up to March 2017, 70 per cent of them are women. The National Literacy Mission Authority (NLMA) is not only imparting basic literacy to adult learners but has also forged partnerships with various agencies to link literacy with other dimensions of socio-economic development like electoral, financial and legal literacy. Its initiatives pertain primarily to rural women. A special drive was undertaken under Saakshar Bharat districts to mobilise more than one crore learners to open and operate bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. The NLMA’s state partners, such as the state literacy mission authorities (SLMAs), state resource centres and jan shiksha sansthans have motivated over one crore beneficiaries to avail benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana. The authority has also tried to align the Saakshar Bharat Programme with the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana.

Literacy programmes can enhance their value if they are creatively linked to the other initiatives of the government like the Swachh Bharat, Mission, Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Digital India Mission and Skill India Mission. The Human Resource Development Ministry has decided to redesign the Saakshar Bharat programme keeping in view the country’s requirements in the next five years. It is also heartening

that in the new variant of the Saakshar Bharat Programme, school and college students are likely to be involved in teaching their illiterate parents, grandparents and neighbours.

We must use technology to make the literacy programmes more effective. Digital learning materials can address the diverse learning needs of different age groups more effectively. Literacy can be made more meaningful if it is linked to the daily lives of the learners. Community learning centres can become the hubs of imparting literacy and community empowerment.

Let us create a new India built on the base of a literate, educated, empowered population. Let us realise that heaven of freedom that Rabindranath Tagore spoke about when he said, “Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, where knowledge is free; where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls”.

**Jain couple to leave 3-yr-old daughter, Rs 100-cr property for monkhood** 

 ______ 
A Jain couple from Madhya Pradesh has decided to leave behind their three-year-old daughter and property worth around Rs 100 crore to become munis (monks), stunning the community that is no stranger to acts of renunciation.

Sumit Rathore, 35, and his wife Anamika, 34, are scheduled to take deeksha (the first step of their initiation into monkhood) under Sudhamargi Jain Acharya Ramlal Maharaj at Surat in Gujarat on September 23.

Their decision has sent shockwaves across hometown Neemuch, about 400km northwest of state capital Bhopal, where their families are established in politics and business.

The first question on the lips of incredulous Neemuch residents is: what about their daughter, Ibhya?

“I will take care of my granddaughter,” said Anamika’s father, Ashok Chandaliya, a former Neemuch district president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

He said no one could convince the couple not to renounce the world. “We had no counter to their religious arguments and relented. One cannot stop anyone when religion calls,” Chandaliya added.

Sumit’s father, Rajendra Singh Rathore, who owns a factory that makes sacks for cement companies, too accepted the decision. “We were expecting this, but not so soon,” he said.

Sumit and Anamika’s decision was not exactly a surprise for their loved ones because they had declared their intent to become munis when Ibhya was only eight months old and, as preparation, started living separately.

Sumit announced his final decision to take deeksha during a gathering of Acharya Ramlal’s at Surat on August 22. The Acharya told him to seek Anamika’s permission. She gave consent and expressed her desire to take deeksha too. Their families rushed to Surat to dissuade them, but failed.

Sumit and Anamika, who married four years ago, have taken a vow of silence till the deeksha.

Anamika was Neemuch’s first gold medallist in Class 8 board examinations. She did her BE from Modi Engineering College, Laxmangarh (Sikar) in Rajasthan, and worked with Hindustan Zinc before marriage.

Sumit holds a diploma in import-export management from a college in London, where he stayed and worked for two years before returning to Neemuch to manage the family business.

Sumit’s cousin, Sandeep, who is close to him, said, “He had everything that a man wanted. Property worth around Rs 100 crore, a loving wife and a daughter. But he chose to renounce everything. We are stunned.”

Prakash Bhandari, a leading Jain community member in Neemuch, said as far as he knew, this decision was unprecedented. “This is the first time that such a young couple is taking deeksha and that too by leaving behind a daughter,” added Bhandari, secretary of Sadhumargi Jain Shravak Sangh.

Earlier this year, a stunning renunciation by a Jain teen from Gujarat made waves across the country.

Varshil Shah, 17, renounced the world and became a monk in June, barely weeks after scoring a stupendous 99.9 percentile in Class 12 Commerce examinations. After initiation for his spiritual quest, the teen’s name changed to Suvirya Ratna Vijayji Maharaj.

The Jain community, with an estimated population of less than 50 lakh in India, follows an austere lifestyle including vegetarianism and a large section is known to observe customs laid down thousands of years ago. Digambara Jain monks – who consider the sky their clothing – still go naked.

The death of a 13-year-old Jain girl, Aradhana Samdariya, in October 2016, less than three days after she ended a 68-day fast under the tapasya ritual practised by her community triggered debates across the country.

Aradhana’s death put the spotlight on the community’s tapasya ritual. Amid debates, many Jain leaders came out in support of her parents, saying they were being hounded and the community was being maligned.

According to Jain elders, the ‘tapasya’ that Aradhana undertook was voluntary and the first of nine steps (nav-pad) aimed at attaining salvation, and it was not the same as the ritual of ‘santhara’ under which the elderly or the sick abstain from food until they die.

319,"&gt; The poor is the vote bank, the poor is their lifeline. At present, all parties cater to the poor. 


All we can do is select the party most likely to bring in pro-capitalist free market reforms, including reforming our overzealous labour and land acquisition regulations. Modi fucked up with Demonetisation and is slower than expected, specially following the ""suit-boot ki sarkar"" jibe, but I still see him as the only viable option. 



&gt; the only way forward for Indians at least is to take drastic measures.


I disagree. Taking drastic measures is counter-productive as the drastic measures will merely be transitive and will be immediately overturned by the next government. The only route is to cut costs by streamlining the welfare system via DBT, JDY and Aadhar; maintain sufficient support from the masses through rhetoric like Hindutva and nationalism; followed by neoliberal reforms. The key objective to ensure the reforms aren't transitive is ensuring that power is maintained. This is why 2019 is critical. Vajpayee tried focusing on just reforms, which led to the ""India Shining"" fiasco. Neoliberal policies lead to everyone benefiting ultimately, but not in the very short term which is all that matters when it comes to the next election cycle. ",2017-09-16 15:13:27

**Now, Mamata Banerjee wants a bullet train for West Bengal** 

 ______ 
A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off his high profile bullet train project from Ahmedabad, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee too sought a similar project for her state.

After chairing a crucial meeting to revamp infrastructure in the state, Banerjee on Friday announced that her government was keen to have a high speed rail corridor between Burdwan and Kolkata.

""We had a plan. We even wrote to the Union Rail Ministry seeking a bullet train project from Durgapur till Kolkata, connecting the new airport at Andal with the existing Dumdum airport so that anyone can reach Kolkata from Andal in an hour,"" she said.

BANERJEE'S PLANS

Banerjee said the country's first private greenfield airport, the Bengal Aerotropolis Project at Andal in Burdwan was being made effective as the capacity of the existing Kolkata airport will soon get stagnant.

Accordingly, the state government has decided to increase its stake to 15 per cent with infusing funds in order to make the project viable.

The state government currently holds 11 per cent stake in BAPL (Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Limited), while Singapore's Changi Airport continues to remain the majority stakeholder with 31 per cent stake.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for India's first bullet train network on the Ahmedabad - Mumbai route. The ambitious project is pegged at a whopping Rs 1.1 lakh crore.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today said her state government too wants high speed bullet trains. Banerjee said, a proposal to this effect had also been sent to the Union Rail Ministry to improve connectivity between state capital Kolkata and the new Andal airport in Burdwan.

Let's say I take your word for it. How many years ago was this again? This is still held against the RSS, despite it clearly being one fundamentalist who shot him. Even the Emergency isn't held with this much vehemence against the Gandhis, despite it being even more recent and the Dynasty being directly culpable. Sanjayji's forceful sterilisation of millions is a distant memory too.



&gt; and delegating more extreme tasks to hardline groups is what they've always done.



Or the Sangh is moderating and reforming over time, and the hardline elements haven't accepted this transition, leading to friction with the main RSS body and the BJP.




&gt; Logic that immediately evaporates when 2002 comes up.



Why? There was massive communal friction and violence post-Godhra carnage, law and order implementation was dodgy, Modi was just freshly elevated to power, the VHP and BDal were subsequently cut down to size, and there have been no more riots in Gujarat. Was Vajpayee held responsible for 2002, or was Modi blamed for it? Similarly, for a Gau Rakshak incident, it's the State's responsibility. Law &amp; order's a State issue, and not an Union issue. Like I said in the earlier comment, this is how the Constitution has structured our Federal Republic.



&gt; but to think he has actually changed from his pracharak days is naive.



Once again, why? People and organisations do change over time. The Democrats used to defend slavery and slave owners, now they claim to be the Social Justice party and elected an African American President.


&gt; The BJP has always been their best bet, much like how white nationalists flock to Trump. 



How many violent gaurakshaks are there in India? These aren't a votebank catered too, and in fact lose way more moderate voters. BJP doesn't benefit from these overzealous and out-of-control fundamentalists, and they have been called out multiple times. States have been asked to be tougher and harsher. Exact same situation with Trump and white supremacists. Are the Democrats considered responsible for Antifa's and Resist's actions? The Right is always held to much higher moral standards than the Left.



&gt; You probably don't consider Yogi Adityanath to be a far right fundie I suppose.


I don't know much about him, but he's been alright after becoming CM.  I was pretty surprised at Yogi's choice though,



From the Hindu-side, Far-Right are the people calling for the extermination of minorities, making a Hindu-Exclusive rashtra, violent gau, and so on.

Marshal of the Indian Air Force, Arjan Singh is admitted to the Army Hospital, Research and Referral in New Delhi on Saturday after he suffered a cardiac arrest earlier in the day, the Defence Ministry said. The five-star general of the Air Force was rushed to the hospital in the wee hours of Saturday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitaraman visited the hospital and inquired about his condition. Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa was also present.

Arjan Singh is the only five-star general of the Air Force who was awarded the lifetime rank in 2002. The 98-year-old officer was commissioned into the IAF in 1938 and served as the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) from August 1, 1964 to July 15, 1969. He was promoted to the rank of the Marshal of Air Force in recognition to his contribution to the Air Force in the 1965 war with Pakistan. Known to be the officer who has flown over 60 aircraft throughout his service, he remained a flyer until the end of his illustrious career.

Following his retirement, Singh served as an ambassador to Switzerland in 1971, concurrently serving as the ambassador to Vatican as well.

**Indian priest rescued from Yemen says captors did him no physical harm** 

 ______ 
Father Tom Uzhannalil, the Indian Catholic priest hailing from Kerala who was abducted by terrorists in Yemen, expressed his thanks to the Narendra Modi government for its concern to secure his release.

“I am thankful to the President (Ram Nath Kovind) and the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and all the ministers concerned whoever has (expressed) concern,” Uzhannalil said.

“Thanks to the country leaders and countrymen. May God bless all of them for their response,” he added.

Uzhannalil said the terrorists who abducted him did not hurt him.

He said that his captors would have responded to the missives that came for his release.

Uzhunnalil, abducted by terrorists in Aden in March last year, was rescued from captivity from an undisclosed location in Yemen. The Sultanate of Oman helped to find and rescue Uzhannalil who is an employee of the Vatican.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had earlier this week tweeted about the release of the Catholic priest.

According to reports reaching Kerala, after his release, the priest was flown from Yemen to Muscat. He later left Oman on a chartered flight for the Vatican.

He will be flown to Kerala later.

**Widening current account deficit a new worry for Modi government, RBI** 

 ______ 
In April, a top commerce ministry official told a group of financial journalists “not to be alarmist” over rising gold imports. The reporters wanted to know if the government was planning any action in the wake of a sudden and sharp spike in gold imports in the preceding month. The official assured them that the government was keeping a watch and would take action, if needed, at an “appropriate time.” Looking back, it appears the authorities may not have been as alert as they ought to have been, or that they erred in reading the situation.

Data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday showed India’s current account deficit (CAD) rose sharply to a four-year high of $14.3 billion, or 2.4% of GDP, in the April-June quarter. It was $3.4billion, or 0.6% of GDP, in the preceding quarter. Current account deficit is the difference between the value of goods and services a country exports and imports. A higher CAD is not necessarily bad if the bulk of it is on account of such imports that help exports and growth and is financed through higher inflow of foreign direct investment. Historically, in the Indian context, a CAD below 3% of GDP is considered sustainable. On the face of it, therefore, a CAD of 2.4% in April-June may not appear worrisome. But a closer scrutiny of why and how the deficit widened so fast will call for remedial measures that must be taken without losing time.

The CAD has widened because imports have grown much faster than exports. Imports have risen faster because of a surge in gold imports and, to some extent, a higher cost of crude oil in the global markets.

India is the world’s second largest gold consumer, where demand for the yellow metal usually peaks in the second-half of the year -- especially during the festive season of Diwali and Dussehra. But according to the World Gold Council, demand for gold in the first-half rose 30% from a year ago to 298 tonnes. Imports grew even faster and more than doubled to 518.6 tonnes. This is puzzling and begs investigation.

Worse, gold imports continued to surge through July and August, thanks to a loophole in the newly introduced goods and services tax (GST). The government charges a 10% import duty on gold, but this does not apply to countries with which it has Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), such as South Korea. However, to prevent duty-free imports from those countries, it had previously levied a 12.5% countervailing duty, which got inadvertently scrapped when GST was introduced on July 1. Gold importers took advantage of this and placed huge orders with exporters in South Korea without paying any tax.

The government stopped this on August 25, but gold imports for the month had already jumped three-fold, the impact of which will show when data on CAD for the July-September period becomes available. As petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan indicated last week, India’s crude oil import cost could rise more than 10% through this quarter. That will add to the deficit, given that exports have not yet gained momentum.

A slowing economy and a growing CAD make a lethal combination. While the former would tend to discourage foreign capital inflows, the latter would have a cascading impact on inflation and competitiveness of Indian exports. Ignoring these warnings could lead to a repeat of what the economy witnessed in the terminal years of the UPA government, when the CAD peaked to an all-time high of 4.5% of GDP, precipitating a crisis for the broader economy.

The imperative in the immediate term would be to identify all such imports that do not aid growth or investment and bring measures to curb them – gold, obviously, should top that list. In the short to medium term, however, the focus must be on exports – identifying sectoral issues and bottlenecks and addressing them on a war footing. On the brighter side, India’s high level of foreign exchange reserves offer enough cushion to maintain orderly conditions in currency trading even if the current account deficit gets out of hand for a couple quarters. But that should not make the government and the RBI complacent.

**Vehicle owners can afford to pay for fuel: Union minister Alphons** 

 ______ 
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Vehicle owners are people who are ""not starving"" and can afford to pay for petrol , Union minister Alphons Kannanthanam on Saturday said, defending the fuel price hike.He said the tax was aimed at mobilising resources for infrastructure projects.""All the money collected goes to the poor and it is an intentional decision taken by the government,"" Alphons told reporters here.He was speaking after visiting the BJP state head office for the first time on assuming charge as Union minister for tourism and IT.""So we are going to tax people who can afford to pay. Who buys petrol ... somebody with car, somebody with a bike. Certainly, they are not starving. Somebody who can afford to pay, has to pay,"" he said.""Yes we are imposing tax on petroleum products ... So that poor in the country will have a dignified life,"" the minister said.He said the funds are being used, among other things, to build toilets and houses for the poor.When pointed out that the BJP had opposed fuel price hike during the UPA regime, Alphons said the government was using the money for the poor and the downtrodden.""Our motto is simple. We are here for the welfare of the lowest in the downtrodden. To make houses and toilets and to get electricity to every villages, it is going to cost enormous amount of money,"" he said.Alphons' remarks come at a time when the Congress has demanded withdrawal of central excise duties and other taxes on petrol and diesel and that it would soon launch a signature campaign in protest.""The Narendra Modi-led government's main focus was welfare of the poor and downtrodden. In India, 30 per cent of the people are downtrodden and crores of rupees were needed for their welfare,"" he said.Alphons said the tax for petroleum products could come down if it was brought under the ambit of GST.But states were not willing to bring liquor and petroleum products under GST, he added.Asked about price rise of essential commodities in the wake of fuel price hike, Alphons said inflation rate of four per cent in the country was less than half per cent prescribed by the RBI.Opposition leader in the state assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, hit out at the Union minister for his remarks on fuel price hike and described it as ""utter foolishness"".

biggest dam - Sardar Sarovar Dam - nearly six decades after its foundation
stone was laid. The inaugural event, held on the occasion of PM Modi's 67th
birthday on Sunday, will also see the culmination of the fortnight-long
Narmada Mahotsav - launched by the Gujarat government to celebrate the
completion of the work.

PM Modi will also address a public rally at Dabhoi, about an hour from
Ahmedabad.

With few months left for the state assembly elections, the Gujarat BJP has
turned the completion of the dam project into a huge political event. The
venue of the event is some 200 km from Ahmedabad.

The Narmada Control Authority had ordered the gates of the Sardar Sarovar
Project be shut on June 16 after which the height of the dam was increased
from 121.92 metres to 138 metres; storage capacity was raised to 4.73 million
cubic metres (MCM) from the existing 1.27 million cubic metres.

The foundation stone for the project was laid in 1961 and the construction
began in 1987.

Over 18 lakh hectares of land in the state would be benefited with irrigation
as Narmada water will flow to over 9,000 villages of Gujarat through a canal
network, Sardar Sarovar Nigam Limited (SSNL) officials said, explaining the
paybacks of the project.

While the main and sub canal network work has been completed, work on about 30
per cent of minor canals is still in progress, they said.

The Sardar Sarovar project is the biggest dam in terms of volume of concrete
used in it. It is also the second biggest dam in the world after the Grand
Coulee Dam in the United States.

The 1.2-km-long dam, which is 163 metres deep has till date produced 4,141
crore units of electricity from its two power houses -- river bed powerhouse
and canal head powerhouse -- with an installed capacity of 1,200 MW and 250
MW, respectively.

The dam has earned over Rs 16,000 crore -- more than double the cost of its
construction, said a government spokesman. Each gate of the dam weighs over
450 tonnes and it takes one hour to close them. According to the SSNL
officials, the power generated from the dam would be shared among three states
-- Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. About 57 percent of the
electricity produced from the dam goes to Maharashtra, while Madhya Pradesh
gets 27 per cent and Gujarat gets 16 per cent.

The project has been mired in several controversies ever since its foundation
stone was laid. The Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) led by social activist Medha
Patkar has been protesting against the project raising several environmental
concerns. In 1996, the construction work was suspended following a stay by the
Supreme Court.

Four years later, the construction work was resumed after the top court gave a
go ahead for the construction work, but with a rider that permission to
increase the dam height would be given in parts after the project-affected-
people (PAP) were resettled or compensated.

**Arjan Singh, Indian Air Force Marshal and war hero, dies at 98**

Arjan Singh, Indian Air Force Marshal and the only officer of the force to be promoted to five-star rank, died Saturday at the Army Research and Referral hospital in New Delhi. He was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition after he suffered a cardiac arrest this morning, the Defence Ministry said. He was being treated at the Cardiothoracic and Vascular Sciences Centre of the hospital.

Singh, who led the IAF during the India-Pakistan war in 1965, is considered an icon and a war hero. He was visited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and chiefs of three forces.

“India mourns the unfortunate demise of Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh. We remember his outstanding service to the nation. Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh’s determined focus on capacity building in the IAF added great strength to our defence capabilities. India will never forget the excellent leadership of Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh in 1965, when the IAF saw substantial action,” said PM Modi in a series of tweets.

“Sometime back I met him, who despite his ill health tried to get up to salute even though I said no. Such was his soldier discipline. My thoughts are with his family &amp; those mourning the demise of a distinguished air warrior &amp; fine human, Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh. RIP,” he added.

Singh was born on April 15, 1919 in undivided Punjab and went on to be selected for the Empire Pilot training course at RAF Cranwell in 1938 when he was just 19. He flew Westland Wapiti biplanes in the North Western Frontier Province as a member of the No.1 IAF Squadron as part of his first posting. He was promoted to the rank of Squadron Leader in 1944 and received the Distinguished Flying Cross the same year for successfully leading the squadron during combat. On 15 August 1947, he was given the honour of leading the fly-past of more than a hundred IAF aircraft over the Red Fort in the national capital. In August 1964, Singh took over as the Chief of Air Staff (CoAS) in the rank of Air Marshal.

“A testing time came in September 1965 when Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam, in which an armoured thrust targeted the vital town of Akhnur, he was summoned into the Defence Minister’s office with a request for air support. When asked how quickly the IAF will be ready for operations,he replied with his characteristic nonchalance,”…in an hour”. And true to his word, the Air Force struck the Pakistani offensive in an hour. He led the IAF through the war showing unparalleled leadership,” a government release said.

Known to be an officer who has flown over 60 aircraft throughout his service, he remained a flyer until the end of his illustrious career.

Following his retirement, Singh served as an ambassador to Switzerland in 1971, concurrently serving as the ambassador to Vatican as well. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan for his leadership during the 1965 war.

“Arjan Singh was and remains a source of inspiration to generations of Indians,” the government release said.

**IAF Marshal Arjan Singh: An epitome of military leadership in classical sense** 

 ______ 
PM Narendra Modi (right) with Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh. PM Narendra Modi (right) with Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh.

Air Force Marshal Arjan Singh, an icon of India’s military history, will always be remembered as a war hero who had successfully led a young IAF during the 1965 Indo-Pak war. The only officer to attain the highest post of Marshal, the Air Force equivalent to the Army’s five star field marshal, Singh was a fearless and exceptional pilot who had flown more than 60 different types of aircraft. He played a major role in transforming the IAF into one of the most potent air forces globally and the fourth biggest in the world.

“His contribution to the Indian Air Force is monumental to the least. The IAF grew with him. He was epitome of military leadership in classical sense and it is, therefore, not surprising that he was honoured with the rank of Air Force Marshal,” former Vice Chief of IAF Kapil Kak said. Singh was honoured with the rank of Marshal on the Republic Day in 2002. Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw and K M Cariappa were the only two army generals honoured with the rank of field marshal. Known as a man of few words, Singh was not only a fearless pilot but had profound knowledge about air power and applied it in a wide spectrum of areas.

Singh had assiduously led the IAF during the 1965 war and denied success to Pakistani air force though it was better equipped with American support. “His most outstanding contribution was during that war,” said Kak. Commending his role in the war, Y B Chavan, the then Defence Minister had written: “Air Marshal Arjan Singh is a jewel of a person, quiet efficient and firm; unexcitable but a very able leader.”

In 1944, the Marshal had led a squadron against the Japanese during the Arakan Campaign, flying close air support missions during the crucial Imphal Campaign and later assisted the advance of the Allied Forces to Yangoon. In recognition of his feat, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on the spot by the Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia, the first Indian pilot to receive it. Singh was selected for the Empire Pilot training course at Royal Air Force (RAF) Cranwell in 1938 when he was 19 years old. He retired from service in 1969.

Singh was born on April 15, 1919, in Lyalpur (now Faislabad, Pakistan), and completed his education at Montgomery (now Sahiwal, Pakistan). His first assignment on being commissioned was to fly Westland Wapiti biplanes in the North-Western Frontier Province as a member of the No.1 RIAF Squadron. After a brief stint with the newly formed No. 2 RIAF Squadron where the Marshal flew against the tribal forces, he later moved back to No.1 Sqn as a Flying Officer to fly the Hawker Hurricane. He was promoted to the rank of Squadron Leader in 1944. For his role in successfully leading the squadron in combat, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in 1944.

On August 15, 1947, he achieved the unique honour of leading a fly-past of over a hundred IAF aircraft over the Red Fort in Delhi. After his promotion to the rank of Wing Commander, he attended the Royal Staff College at the UK. Immediately after Indian independence, he commanded Ambala in the rank of Group Captain. In 1949, he was promoted to the rank of Air Commodore and took over as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of an operational command, which later came to be known as Western Air Command. Singh had the distinction of having the longest tenure as AOC of an operational base, initially from 1949-1952 and then again from 1957-1961.

After his promotion to the rank of Air Vice Marshal, he was appointed as the AOC-in-C of an operational command. Towards the end of the 1962 war, he was appointed as the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and he became the Vice Chief of the Air Staff in 1963. He was the overall commander of the joint air training exercise “Shiksha” held between IAF, RAF (Royal Air Force) and RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force). On August 1, 1964, in the rank of Air Marshal, the Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh took over reins of IAF, at a time when it was still rebuilding itself and was gearing up to meet new challenges.

Singh was the first Air Chief to keep his flying currency till his CAS rank.

Having flown over 60 different types of aircraft from pre-World War II era biplanes to the more contemporary, Gnats and Vampires, he has also flown in transport aircraft like the Super Constellation. In 1965, when Pakistan launched its Operation Grand Slam, with an armoured thrust targeted at the vital town of Akhnoor, Singh led IAF through the war with courage, determination and professional skill. He inspired IAF to victory, despite the constraints imposed on the full-scale use of Air Force combat power. Singh was awarded Padma Vibhushan for his astute leadership of the Air Force during the war.

Subsequently in recognition of the Air Force’s contribution during the war, the rank of the CAS was upgraded and Arjan Singh became the first Air Chief Marshal of the Indian Air Force. He remained a flyer to the end of his tenure in IAF, visiting forward bases and units and flying with the squadrons. He retired in August 1969, there upon accepting Ambassadorship to Switzerland. He was Lieutenant Governor of Delhi from December 1989 to December 1990. Having been a source of inspiration to all personnel of Armed Forces through the years, government conferred the rank of the Marshal of the Air Force upon Arjan Singh in January 2002 making him the first and the only ‘Five Star’ rank officer with Indian Air Force.

**Jain Couple To Leave 3-Year-Old Child, '100-Crore Property' For Monkhood** 

 ______ 
Sumit Rathore and Anamika Rathore will be initiated in Jain monasticism at a
ceremony this month.

**Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh: **

A Jain couple from a small town in Madhya Pradesh has decided to leave behind
their three-year-old daughter and property ""worth Rs 100 crore"" to embrace
monkhood under the '

_Shwetambar_

' (white clad) order of their religion, according to their families.

Sumit Rathore, 35, who had worked in London before managing his family
business in Neemuch, and his wife Anamika (34), an engineer who was employed
with a mining major, decided to renounce the material world recently, they
said.

The couple will be initiated in Jain monasticism at a ceremony to be held in
Surat on September 23 by Sudhamargi Jain Acharya Ramlal Maharaj.

Their family members today said the couple has been married for four years and
has a daughter.

Currently, they have taken a vow of silence till they take 'deeksha' (vow)
next Saturday.

As per the monkhood tradition, their heads will be shaved and they will put on
white robes for their entire life, as per the practice of monks and nuns of
the Shwetambar sect.

The couple will start wearing mouth-clothes as per the tradition after the
deeksha ceremony. The mouth cloth is worn by Jain hermits so that they do not
swallow any living creature like flies etc. even by an accident while they are
talking.

Anamika's father Ashok Chandaliya, a former Neemuch district president of the
BJP, said he would take care of his grand-daughter. ""I am not against my
daughter Anamika becoming a nun,"" he said.

Sumit's father Rajendra Singh, who runs a factory manufacturing gunny bags for
packaging cement, also echoed a similar view.

Sumit and Anamika decided to renounce the material world for spiritual
pursuits when their daughter was just eightmonth old, said Sumit's cousin
Sandip Rathore.

Sumit announced his decision to take 'deeksha' at a function attended by
Acharya Ramlal at Surat last month.

""However, the pontiff asked him to seek Anamika's permission. She not only
gave her consent but also expressed desire to become a nun. Their families
asked them to rethink, but the couple stood their ground,"" Sandip said.

He said Anamika was the first student in Neemuch district to win a gold medal
in her Board examinations for class VIII.

According to a family member, she did her BE from Modi Engineering College at
Laxmangarh in Sikar in Rajasthan. She had worked with Hindustan Zinc before
her marriage.

Sandip said Sumit holds a diploma in import-export management from a college
in London, where he worked for two years before returning to Neemuch to look
after his family business.

He claimed Sumit owns properties ""running into Rs 100 crore"".

Jainism emphasises on non-violence and vegetarianism and is followed by less
than one per cent of the country's total population.

Earlier this year, a Jain teenage boy from Gujarat, who had scored 99.99
percentile in class XII Commerce examination, took the vow of monkhood.

LEGACY OF COURAGE

Singh was born in 1919 in Lyalpur, which is now in Faisalabad province of Pakistan. He joined the Royal Indian Air Force when he was 19 years old.

He led his squadron against the Japanese in the Arakan Campaign and in the Imphal Campaign, he flew Close Air Support Missions.

He then moved on to fight in the campaign to free Rangoon. For his valour, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). On August 15, 1947, when India became independent, Singh led the fly-past of over 100 aircraft over the Red Fort.

The Marshal led the Western Air Command after independence and took charge as the Indian Air Force Chief in 1964. The IAF then, as it is now, was on the cusp of a change. While the IAF was adapting itself to modernisation and rebuilding, the 1965 war with Pakistan began.

The IAF was still largely using World War-II era fighters. The first set of Russian-made supersonic Mig-21 had just about arrived. In contrast, Pakistan had US-made modern fighter jets. Despite constraints, the IAF achieved complete air superiority, giving the ground forces the much-needed support.

**PM Modi to dedicate Narmada Dam to nation on his birthday** 

 ______ 
Tomorrow, Sardar Sarovar Dam will be dedicated to the nation. This project will benefit lakhs of farmers &amp; help fulfil people's aspirations. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1505560366000

AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Sunday dedicate to the nation the Sardar Sarovar Dam on river Narmada, described as Gujarat's lifeline by BJP leaders, at an event coinciding with his 67th birthday.The foundation stone of the dam was laid on April 5, 1961 by the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru . However, it took 56 years to complete its construction.His visit, which has added significance as the assembly elections are due in Gujarat by year-end, is the second in less than a week after he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe here and launched the Bullet train project.""Tomorrow Sardar Sarovar Dam will be dedicated to the nation. This project will benefit lakhs of farmers and help fulfil people's aspirations,"" Modi tweeted today.Earlier, Modi had stressed that the project will start a new chapter of prosperity for Gujarat.Chief minister Vijay Rupani had called the project as ""Gujarat's lifeline"" noting that the agriculture income and production of farmers in the state more than doubled because of it.The event will take place at Kevadia in Narmada district.The delay in the completion of the dam was due to numerous reasons. Medha Patkar-led Narmada Bachao Andolan took the government to the Supreme Court over environmental and rehabilitation issues, and obtained a stay in 1996.The court allowed resumption of work in October 2000.The height of the dam was recently raised to 138.68 metres, which will allow maximum 'usable storage' of 4.73 million acre feet of water.""The Congress committed the sin of obstructing the project at every step. Within 20 days of becoming prime minister, Modi gave final approval to raise the height of the dam,"" Gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya said here.After the inauguration at the dam site at Kevadia, Modi will go to Sadhu Bet, an island in the Narmada river where a 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, called 'Statue of Unity', and a memorial complex dedicated to the country's first home minister are coming up.Thereafter, the PM will attend the closing ceremony of 'Narmada Mahotsav', and address a gathering at Dabhoi.He will also lay the foundation stone for National Tribal Freedom Fighters' Museum during the event. Modi will then visit Amreli in Saurashtra where he will attend a host of programmes and address a public gathering.""Looking forward to addressing a gathering of cooperatives, Sahakar Samemelan in Amreli tomorrow,"" the PM tweeted.Meanwhile, the Gujarat Congress has claimed that the project is not complete and canals of 43,000 km length were yet to be built despite the BJP ruling the state for 22 years.

Modi is surprisingly similar to Trump in some sense - he also has a fascist nationalist agenda, pro-Hindutva but knows to keep his mouth shut. All communication with Modi is one-way.

People don't understand, but what's the point to make babies when you give an ugly life.

**On his birthday, PM Modi to dedicate Narmada dam to nation** 

 ______ 
GANDHINAGAR: Fifty-six years after its foundation was laid by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the Sardar Sarovar Dam was finally completed on June 17 with the dam height raised to 138.68 metres. It will be dedicated to the nation by PM Narendra Modi on Sunday, his birthday. The completion of dam, expedited by the PMO since December 2014 is BJP's political plank in poll-bound Gujarat.The height of the dam was recently raised to 138.68 metres, facilitating a usable storage of 4.73 Million Acre feet (MAF).

**'Infosys Hasn't Failed': Government Backs IT Firm Amid GST Tech Glitches** 

 ______ 
Infosys is handling much of the IT infrastructure for Goods and Services Tax
Network (GSTN).

**BENGALURU: **

A group of ministers (GoM) - appointed by the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Council to look into the technical challenges that have been facing after the
launch of this massive tax reform - met today in Bengaluru. The GoM is headed
by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.

Representatives from Infosys were also part of the meet. Infosys is handling
much of the IT infrastructure for GST Network (GSTN).

It is no secret that the implementation of that biggest tax reform GST has not
been as smooth as desired. ""The systems had not crashed...and that the
pressure was due to the scale of operations and last minute rush by tax
payers,"" Mr Modi said.

He also said that, ""22 crore invoices have been filed in two and a half months
and 85 lakhs new and old dealers have been registered under GST.""

He further stated, ""I want to appeal to tax payers that they should not wait
for the last day. Because of that there is a heavy rush for the system. Only
five days left for August filing and only 3.05 lakh have filed form 3B
compared to more than 45 lakh in July...so there will be a rush.""

We will be able to solve the nitty-gritties found in the IT system, he added.

Infosys, which is handling the GSTN, was represented at the meet. And, the
government defended the IT major's role. Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said,
""Infosys has not failed. They have been delivering very well. Hiccups will be
there which need to be sorted out.""

The team insisted the glitches were minor and included non-availability of
some forms online or difficulty for the user in changing some fields.

The GoM will meet again soon - probably in Bengaluru again - as Infosys is
headquartered in the city.

**How India's four-pronged strategy on the Rohingya problem evolved** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Prime minister Narendra Modi 's apparent endorsement of Myanmar 's military crackdown on Rohingya extremist groups set off alarm bells in Bangladesh and India for different reasons.Within hours of Modi's return, it was clear his failure to address the issue of refugees in Myanmar would create problems both within India and in Bangladesh. Senior Indian officials conferred to tweak the Indian approach. After Bangladesh high commissioner Muazzem Ali met foreign secretary S Jaishankar, India made a significant course correction, by calling on Myanmar to stop the violence and control the refugee outflow. From Wednesday, India has been running daily flights with relief material for Bangladesh government dealing with Rohingya refugees . It appears that India has made a 180-degree diplomatic turn from Myanmar to Bangladesh. Simultaneously the Supreme Court is hearing petition challenging the deportation of Rohingya illegal migrants, because that is a core political issue for the BJP government, as articulated by the minister of state for home, Kiren Rijiju But sifting through disparate statements and according to senior government sources, a four-pronged policy is being worked on by the Indian government. This will find articulation in the statements by Sushma Swaraj, who will lead the Indian delegation to the UNGA for the second time running.First, India will continue to support Myanmar's right to go after ARSA or AMM or any of the other Rohingya terror groups. In a statement on September 9, MEA stated, ""We had earlier strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Myanmar security forces in Rakhine State. The two countries have since affirmed their shared determination to combat terrorism and not allow its justification under any pretext. During the Prime Minister's recent visit to Myanmar, he had expressed his concern at the casualties of security forces as well as other innocent lives.""In addition, India will assist in the development of the Rakhine province as a means of tackling the problem at its source.Second, India will push Myanmar to find a political solution to the crisis of legal identity of the Rohingya. As Sushma Swaraj told Sheikh Hasina in a phone conversation on Friday, India will oppose Myanmar's acts of pushing Rohingya into Bangladesh or to other countries in the region. This is adding to the pressure on Bangladesh. But also increasing, substantially the possibilities of Pakistan-based terror groups like LeT, al-Qaida and even Islamic State exploiting them for terror activities. There is enough evidence that a number of Rohingya have been radicalised by terror entities.In Bangladesh, which is already battling its own terrorist problem, the radicalised Rohingya could be used by the Jamaat and BNP for their political ends, which would be incendiary coming just before elections in that country scheduled for 2018.Third, sources said the Indian government will defend its right to evict illegal migrants. The issue is politically sensitive for the BJP government which campaigned against such migration in the north-east states. In addition, the presence of Rohingya in Jammu has sparked more such fears. Others have pointed to terror leaders like Zakir Musa supporting the Rohingya, as reason to deport them.In addition, India this week hit back against the UN from commenting on India's right. Pushing back against the comments of the UNHRC chief, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the Indian envoy criticised the world body for ""tendentious judgments made on the basis of selective and even inaccurate reports do not further the understanding of human rights in any society. Like many other nations, India is concerned about illegal migrants, in particular, with the possibility that they could pose security challenges. Enforcing the laws should not be mistaken for lack of compassion.""Security concerns are paramount here. Myanmar will have to find a political solution to the Rohingya within its own constitution, which will be very hard for Aung San Suu Kyi , because it will impact her support among the Buddhists, whose resurgent nationalism is one of the reasons for the Rohingya's plight. On the other hand, Sheikh Hasina is battling with the prospect that the stateless Rohingya can be used against her by her political opposition. In India, governments in the northeast as well as in the centre would suffer at the hustings if they are not seen to be acting against illegal migration.For context, on August 25, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgents launched coordinated attacks on 30 government targets in Rakhine, resulting in a military crackdown, and sparking the current wave of refugee exodus. But the region has watched the Marawi violence in Philippines and are on tenterhooks as IS fighters look beyond Syria and Iraq as their next targets. In 2014, Rakhine was declared a key region for jihad by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Bangladesh wants Myanmar to go after the terrorists, but spare the general population. Making a rare statement, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi said that it was a problem for her government. Using Kashmir as a comparison point, she said, ""Because (there is) a large Muslim community in India and in places like Kashmir, you had this trouble of sorting out the terrorists from the innocent citizens and all those who are not involved in the terrorist movement at all. So we have the same problem.""The Rohingya problem will test Indian diplomacy and counter-terrorism capabilities in the coming months.

**As US dithers, India-Japan reviewing South China Sea position? - Times of India** 

 ______ 
Modi-Abe summit was intended to address Chinese expansionism in the form of its OBOR +

as the previous two summit declarations +

The omission of SCS +

NEW DELHI: While a lot of what India and Japan discussed at the One Belt One Road ) initiative, the two countries also allowed a concession to Beijing by avoiding any explicit mention of South China Sea (SCS).This is particularly significantspecifically referred to SCS while reaffirming commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight. This time though the successful resolution to the Doklam dispute, which saw China agreeing to India's demand to stop road construction to where Beijing believes the India-Bhutan-China tri-junction is, and Japan's preoccupation with North Korea meant a more restrained response in their joint statement to the security challenge in SCS.The Modi government introduced explicit mentions of SCS in its joint declarations, first with the US in 2014, in line with a more assertive Act East policy and to maintain a deliberate ambiguity in its position on China's maritime territorial disputes with its neighbours. This was also in keeping with exhortations by several Asean nations for India to increase its profile in the region.may also partly have resulted from what many see as the indifference of the US under President Donald Trump to the situation in SCS . As strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney says, India and Japan are now faced with very difficult choices on SCS with Trump effectively giving Beijing a ""free pass"" to act in whatever manner it wants to. ""The omission is especially significant given the reference to the SCS in the 2015 and 2016 joint statements. India and Japan cannot ignore the fact that the US has no clear policy on SCS,"" says Chellaney.There is, however, a view that North Korea's provocations may force Trump to rethink his options. To be sure, the US is now said to be planning regular freedom of navigation operations in SCS. However, reports from Southeast Asia suggest that, with Trump and the international community focused on North Korea, China is quietly consolidating its territorial claims in SCS.According to Chellaney, under Obama, the US allowed China to change the status quo by force in the SCS without incurring any international costs, thereby emboldening Chinese actions in the Himalayas and the East China Sea, and Trump has shown no inclination to challenge Beijing in SCS. ""Under Trump, the US has no desire to seek a return to status quo ante in the SCS. As a result, China is consolidating its position in the SCS, even as the US symbolically undertakes freedom-of-navigation operations in the region,"" he says.There was a mention of UNCLOS in the 2017 India-Japan joint statement for sure and the same paragraph also reiterated the determination to work together for stability, peace and development in the Indo-Pacific. It's still a dilution though of the 2016 document which said the two PMs ""regarding the South China Sea"" stressed the importance of resolving the disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law including the UNCLOS. This time foreign secretary S Jaishankar said the Indo-Pacific reference addressed the issue without mentioning specific geographies.

**Officials ‘in dark’, BJP takes over Varanasi government schools to mark PM Modi’s birthday** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (PTI Photo)

AMIDST CUTOUTS of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, almost all government primary schools across his Varanasi Lok Sabha constitutency on Saturday celebrated his 67th birthday. Songs were sung, sweets were distributed, and classes were cancelled for a part of the day in most schools, to hold the function. Varanasi district Basic Shiksha Adhikari Brij Bhushan Chaudhary told The Sunday Express he had not received any written communication for the event to be held in primary schools. “I do not know about any such event.

We forwarded no written notification to primary schools.” However, BJP Kashi district secretary Ashok Chaurasiya said the party did not need permission because the party had “adopted” all primary schools earlier this month. But as confusion reigned over government schools being used thus for a party function, the BJP distanced itself from the events. UP BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan said, “We only sent a circular to local party units to hold swachhta programmes across UP. But we said nothing on Modiji’s birthday celebrations and neither do we know anything about them.”

On Saturday, a day before Modi’s birthday, party workers held the celebrations in 129 of Varanasi’s 150 government primary schools. In other UP regions, like Lucknow, celebrations will be held on Monday. There will be no cake-cutting, a party leader said, as “it is not part of Bharatiya sanskriti”. However, at least one BJP MLA, Avinash Trivedi, of Bakshi Ka Talab in Lucknow, cut a 5-kg cake. He held the celebrations at a government primary school in Itaunja in his Assembly segment, apart from a cleanliness drive. Later, sweets were distributed.

On Sunday, the day of the birthday, the BJP plans to distribute fruits and biscuits at government hospitals. In Varanasi, celebrations will be held in 70 government hospitals and orphanages, and city roundabouts will be decorated, with 67 diyas at each chowk.

For the school celebrations on Saturday, party workers had been instructed to bring along a photograph of Modi, and to highlight the PM’s welfare measures. “We used paraphernalia left over from previous elections. I sent the portrait of Modiji from my house to be used for the birthday event at the Middle and Primary Balika Vidyalayas, in Chowk, Ramnagar,” Asha Gupta, a former Ramnagar councillor, said.

At the Bheeti village school, “adopted” by BJP Kashi district president Lakshman Acharya, around 20 BJP workers cleaned the premises early in the morning. A big cutout of Modi was placed on a plastic chair.

Around 7.20 am, Acharya drove in along with partymen and asked students to name the prime minister of “Bharat Varsh”. The students were promised free pens and copies, and chairs to sit on. “There is no shame in being poor,” Acharya said. “Lal Bahadur Shastri was poor, but his parents got him educated. So did Modiji’s and mine.”

He raised slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram, and Narendra Modi Zindabad, and the children followed him. Principal Om Prakash asked three students, Shiv Prakash, Rishabh Gaur and Waris Khan, to lead their “school-wallah naara (cheer)”. The students shouted, “The food we eat, the clothes we don, the water we drink of, that belongs to my lovely country/ Bharat Mata ki jai, Bharat Mata ki jai”.

Later, Acharya distributed biscuits and bananas among the students, and inspected the toilet under construction near the premises. At the primary and middle girl schools “adopted” by Asha Gupta, Acharya led slogan-shouting, and a question and answer session on Modi. Later, students and teachers lined up for selfies with the PM’s cutout.

The principal of the girls’ middle school, Rajiv Singh, listed the Modi government’s achievements, including schemes like Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Ghar Ghar Sauchalya, and Ujjwal Yojana. The head girl, designated “the Pradhan Mantri of the school”, spoke about Modi, his parents, the city of his birth, and that “Bal Narendra” sold tea at a railway station, before becoming the CM of Gujarat four times and then the PM with a “bhaari bahumat”. He was now bringing “revolutionary change” in the country, she said. Slogans of Har Har Mahadev were among those raised as part of the festivities.

Tanya Maurya, of Class 8, said she enjoyed the programme. Her friend Nazim Khan added that a celebration on this scale was held only twice a year at their school, on Independence Day and Republic Day.

Criticising the celebrations, state Congress vice-president Mani Shankar said the BJP was breaking all protocol by “forcibly” holding such an event at government institutions, encroaching on rights of students. “We never held such celebrations on Jawaharlal Nehru or other party leaders of the Congress. These celebrations can be held among party members but not in government institutions. This is the BJP’s attempt at promoting cult and personality politics, and the RSS’s attempt at saffronising education. Next time, when another party is in power at the Centre or in the state, it will also follow suit,” he said.

Principal Rajiv Singh and BJP leader Asha Gupta denied the allegations. “There is nothing rajnaitik (political) in this. This is a cultural programme organised by the wise and good people of society and we are proud of the opportunity to celebrate the birth of our Prime Minister, a great man,” Singh said. He added, “If another political party wants to celebrate its leader’s birthday in schools, we will welcome the move, provided the leader enjoys as much popularity and is as great as our Prime Minister.”

Chaurasiya said, “What the government does in the 150 primary schools of Varanasi is a separate thing. We as a party this month have adopted a school each to work for their betterment, like building toilets which are absent or defunct in almost half the schools, cleaning the school premises and other such activities. Humein in schoolon ki dasha sudharna hai (We have to right the direction of these schools).” Teachers at the Chowk primary school, Vikas Kumar and Seema Bhatnagar, said that at least to the children it mattered little. They were too young to understand the politics of it, they said, and were just happy for the sweets.

**GST: CBEC orders verification of large tax credit claims** 

 ______ 
The government exceeded its combined revenue target for union and state governments for July and collected about Rs95,000 crore. Photo: Mint

The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has asked its field officers to verify large tax credit claims of companies for July on an urgent basis as these have touched Rs65,000 crore.

Businesses were allowed to claim credit for the taxes paid on raw materials and services under the previous indirect tax regime, which can be used to set off their liability on the final goods under the goods and services tax (GST) system.

A person with knowledge of the development, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said CBEC has asked field officers to verify claims for tax credit above Rs1 crore during the transition to GST by 20 September.

It is, however, not clear how accurate the Rs65,000 crore claim is, as many businesses would have already taken into account the available credits at the time of paying taxes for July. The person cited above added that confusion or mistakes may have led to exaggerated claims.

Experts said an accurate assessment can be made only when the GST system stabilizes. Businesses have an opportunity to revise their tax credit claim.

“Rather than taking a massive verification exercise immediately, it might be good to wait for a couple of months to draw a meaningful conclusion on whether the quantum of CGST transitional credit claimed may be in excess,” said Pratik Jain, partner and leader of indirect tax practice at PwC India.

The government exceeded its combined revenue target for union and state governments for July and collected about Rs95,000 crore. The IT system supporting GST is still to stabilize as businesses face difficulties in filing returns, forcing the GST Council to grant more time to assessees to file returns for July, the first month of the tax reform.

A ministerial panel led by Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi will examine the problems in the IT infrastructure supporting GST at a meeting in Bengaluru on Saturday.

**Fifth column: Rahul’s speech hit home** 

 ______ 
Congress Vice President, Rahul Gandhi at Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley, California PTI Photo Congress Vice President, Rahul Gandhi at Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley, California PTI Photo

Last week’s festivities in Ahmedabad to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan were so spectacular, it felt as if the bullet train was already here. Bunting and lights decorated the streets and dancers and musicians performed all along the route to the Sabarmati ashram. Shinzo Abe and Narendra Modi rode in an open jeep instead of in bullet-proof cars. This delighted the crowds who cheered the cavalcade on and told TV reporters that their admiration for Modi was undiminished and that, of course, the BJP was going to win Gujarat again.

So the future should seem filled with cloudless skies. Right? Why then have I begun to detect the first signs of vulnerability in the Modi government? In the past three years there has not been a single moment when the Prime Minister has seemed anything but invincible. He remained invincible when the Aam Aadmi Party won nearly every seat in the Delhi Assembly within months of the general election that gave Modi a full majority in the Lok Sabha.

He remained invincible when the midnight elimination of more than eighty per cent of our banknotes caused such disruption and misery that Opposition leaders launched a united assault. Chief ministers arrived in Delhi and held public meetings to declare that Modi had stolen the people’s money and given it to his rich friends. The people will punish him through the ballot box, they screamed from public podiums, and our usually reticent former prime minister stood up in the Rajya Sabha to make a speech in which he called demonetisation ‘a case of organized loot (and) legalized plunder.’ Then came the BJP’s magnificent victory in Uttar Pradesh and they slunk off defeated once more. Privately, Opposition leaders admitted that Modi was undefeatable for now. Privately, they blamed Rahul Gandhi for this and whispered about his failure to ‘mature’ as a leader.

So it is ironic that it should have been Rahul Gandhi who last week revealed wittingly or unwittingly that the Modi government’s real vulnerability is the economy. Personally, I would have paid no attention to Rahul’s speech in Berkeley had Modi’s Minister of Information &amp; Broadcasting not reacted the way she did. When Smriti Irani went on national television to rage against the Congress vice-president for being a ‘failed dynast’ and to mock him for his ‘failed political career,’ I realized he must have said something that really hurt.

He said many things. He accused the Prime Minister of creating an atmosphere of ‘violence and hatred’ and mentioned the murder of ‘liberal journalists’ as if this were routine and new. Journalists have been killed in Congress times too and although cow vigilantes were not so visible, there have been terrible occasions of violence and hatred under Congress rule. Unsurprisingly, the first question at the end of Rahul’s Berkeley speech was about the pogroms against the Sikh community in 1984. So it was easy for BJP spokespersons to refute the ‘hatred and violence’ charge but not that easy to deny Rahul’s charges on the economy.

He said demonetisation had been done ‘unilaterally’ and at devastating cost to India, and that it had broken the back of many small- and medium-size businesses, and caused great agricultural distress. He pointed out that the economy was now growing very slowly and that the Modi government had failed to create the 30,000 jobs that India needs to create daily. This is all true.

It is also true, as Rahul Gandhi pointed out, that the economy needs to start growing at 8 per cent to create the jobs that young Indians desperately need. What the Congress party’s heir apparent did not mention was that it was under his Mummy’s government that the economy began to slow down. It picked up for a few months after Modi became Prime Minister, but since that midnight hour when our currency vanished, it has been hurting badly. Small businesses were just beginning to recover when along came GST and hit them once more with complicated rates and paperwork. Some of the rules have left even officials confused, so for the moment the economy remains tangled in reams of red tape. Big companies can hire experts to help them negotiate the regulatory maze. Small companies cannot so they are hurting more.

This is not good news for the Prime Minister because it was with the hope that he would bring prosperity, jobs and real change that the Indian people gave him the first full majority in thirty years. So are voters beginning to feel betrayed? It is clear from recent polls that Modi’s personal popularity remains intact. He is seen as an honest man trying to do the best he can for the country, but many others in his team are not seen this way. Only a dramatic economic upturn will make voters overlook some glaring flaws in his governance.

411,"Well, India only supplies medicines and other live saving necessities to N. Korea. IMO, the entire sanctions approach to N. Korea has only given China an undue leverage who provides 95-97% of the trade with N. Korea. So, China still has more and near absolute foreign  influence over N. Korea as compared to any other country. They are the ones propping up N. Korea.  

N. Korea is not gonna stop its tests because it thinks that US will steam roller it if it does and it is correct in thinking so. If US takes down N.Korea, China and Russia would have US at their doorstep which is the last thing they want so they prop it up and support it. Moreover, N. Korea keeps Us engaged so CHina can surrepititously continue its own expansion policy under US radar. SO CHina is more interested in preserving the current situation and taking N. Korea down would be the last thing they want to do.

The bright idea woul be to say, okay, N. Korea is gonna test nuclear missiles, fine, let them do it. However, they have to play by the rules everyone else does, let inspectors in and report to UN. Also, they have to start directing money towards the welfare of the people. With every program you start for the benefit of the people, we shalll lift a batch of the sanctions. Because the sanctions are just starving the public. I mean just look at Kim and look at the people, who do you think the sanctions have affected. N. Korea is a problem because China has an undue leverage on them. The best thing INO would be to open up N. Korean economy and remove that influence and then maybe take them down from the inside.

I would even be happy with a general direction of where the policy is supposed to be going. India has never had a foreign policy and it is high time we had one but I am yet to see anything taking concrete form.

As for NK opening up. It is stuck in the 50's because it has been under sanctions for almost 50 years. If these were lifted, NK would open it up. The resistance would come from China, not N. Korea. Kim misses cheese - it's not parody, really, because of the sanctions he cannot get some kind of cheese he really likes amongst a few other things. However, the initiation of this has to come from the US through UN or from EU. That is not going to happen because their foreign policy is also stuck in the 50's in a way. N. Korea would open its economy with respect to some things at least and then the rest can be built upon. 

Plus, remember, the North Koreans have no means to see what the world is like, They are completely cut off and brainwashed by the regime into thinking that everyone else is bad and Kim is their sole savior. Still, many want out from that country. If the economy is opened up, this brainwashing can be stopped and in a couple of decade's time, North Koreans would want the Kim regime out themselves. However, Like I said, US and CHina with Russia are the key players. I don't even know what Modi is trying to do here.",2017-09-17 13:42:09

417,"According to them, only the people have failed by ""waiting until the last day.""

It is a design fail to me. The portal can only take 60,000 to 80,000 people in one hour. The total number of registrants is 87 lakh. Even if you divide each group of 80,000 registrants into hourly slots and all of them diligently use the portal only then, there still aren't enough days for everyone to finish filing without the portal being overloaded.

But the bigger travesty is that there is no time-allocation strategy. Everyone is told to file as soon as possible. Fine, but that means that many more than 80,000 people will try to use the portal simultaneously. Many will fail and will be told to try later. Well, later the system will be busier. So more will be turned away (at an increasing rate). Until the last day when all the people who were turned away so far and the genuine 'late rush' people will try their luck and the thing will collapse. And then the government will blame the people and wash their hands. So a lot of people will have wasted days on end trying to file returns and will just waste their time. AND they will be slapped with fines.

On top of this Modi wants all businesses to register for GST and file returns. With a system like this, he is asking all of Indian business to stop doing their jobs and play portal, portal on this stupid website.

**Jain Couple To Leave 3-Year-Old Child, '100-Crore Property' For Monkhood** 

 ______ 
Sumit Rathore and Anamika Rathore will be initiated in Jain monasticism at a
ceremony this month.

**Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh: **

A Jain couple from a small town in Madhya Pradesh has decided to leave behind
their three-year-old daughter and property ""worth Rs 100 crore"" to embrace
monkhood under the '

_Shwetambar_

' (white clad) order of their religion, according to their families.

Sumit Rathore, 35, who had worked in London before managing his family
business in Neemuch, and his wife Anamika (34), an engineer who was employed
with a mining major, decided to renounce the material world recently, they
said.

The couple will be initiated in Jain monasticism at a ceremony to be held in
Surat on September 23 by Sudhamargi Jain Acharya Ramlal Maharaj.

Their family members today said the couple has been married for four years and
has a daughter.

Currently, they have taken a vow of silence till they take 'deeksha' (vow)
next Saturday.

As per the monkhood tradition, their heads will be shaved and they will put on
white robes for their entire life, as per the practice of monks and nuns of
the Shwetambar sect.

The couple will start wearing mouth-clothes as per the tradition after the
deeksha ceremony. The mouth cloth is worn by Jain hermits so that they do not
swallow any living creature like flies etc. even by an accident while they are
talking.

Anamika's father Ashok Chandaliya, a former Neemuch district president of the
BJP, said he would take care of his grand-daughter. ""I am not against my
daughter Anamika becoming a nun,"" he said.

Sumit's father Rajendra Singh, who runs a factory manufacturing gunny bags for
packaging cement, also echoed a similar view.

Sumit and Anamika decided to renounce the material world for spiritual
pursuits when their daughter was just eight-month-old, said Sumit's cousin
Sandip Rathore.

Sumit announced his decision to take 'deeksha' at a function attended by
Acharya Ramlal at Surat last month.

""However, the pontiff asked him to seek Anamika's permission. She not only
gave her consent but also expressed desire to become a nun. Their families
asked them to rethink, but the couple stood their ground,"" Sandip said.

He said Anamika was the first student in Neemuch district to win a gold medal
in her Board examinations for class VIII.

According to a family member, she did her BE from Modi Engineering College at
Laxmangarh in Sikar in Rajasthan. She had worked with Hindustan Zinc before
her marriage.

Sandip said Sumit holds a diploma in import-export management from a college
in London, where he worked for two years before returning to Neemuch to look
after his family business.

He claimed Sumit owns properties ""running into Rs 100 crore"".

Jainism emphasises on non-violence and vegetarianism and is followed by less
than one per cent of the country's total population.

Earlier this year, a Jain teenage boy from Gujarat, who had scored 99.99
percentile in class XII Commerce examination, took the vow of monkhood.

Five ideas working together cannot become the opposition. Five people, who have ambitions to become prime minister or chief minister, cannot be a united opposition. The idea of corruption-free India can be a united opposition, the idea of developing India through education can be one, but who is working towards that?” he said. Sisodia added that the BJP has derailed conversations and discussions about 

Man so much this. 

Nitish, Lalu, Mamta, Kejriwal, Mayawati, Naidu, Tharoor etc. are good in posturing themselves according to their votebanks. But none can beat the perception of a leader what Modi has created of himself and appeals to different strata of societies. 

They can be only together till the time they see Modi as the opposition but the moment the supposed third front comes to power they will struggle to hold onto power since they don't have anything else to offer. And also given they all are opportunistic, they all would want the plum job.

&gt; The Opposition should have been talking about education and health

Only take Punjab for example, Congress should be blazing with guns with basic healthcare and education given their downfall. But

&gt; ***No grant after May, Punjab schools serve midday meals on credit. Teachers now claim that the scheme might be discontinued if the grant is not released soon as the ‘shopkeepers, who are providing items on credit, have given them an ultimatum’.*** http://indianexpress.com/article/education/no-grant-after-may-punjab-schools-serve-midday-meals-on-credit-4840758/

&gt; For over three months now, 19,811 schools in Punjab have not received any grant under the midday meal scheme to purchase ‘cooking items’. Payments of cooking staff post July have also not come through. Short of funds, the schools in the state were forced to ask teachers to manage the show on credit or spend from their own pockets to keep the scheme running, with an assurance that the money will be reimbursed.

&gt; Around 2 million school children of primary and upper primary classes are enrolled under the scheme in state.

&gt; **Government had released the last midday meal scheme instalment for cooking items in the month of May, and no grant was received for June, July and August, and also September so far. The payment to cooking staff is also due for over one-and-half month.**

I so much wished AAP would had won the Punjab state elections and atleast we could have known their performance beyond their mayorship of Delhi and with actual powers of a complete state.

**Greenpeace condemns Sardar Sarovar Dams inauguration** 

 ______ 
New Delhi, Sep 17 (PTI) Greenpeace India today condemned the inauguration of Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river, saying it signals ""ruin"" and not development of 10,000 hapless and poor farmers.

The NGO said the Sardar Sarovar Project, which was dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, would not bring any development for advasis in the absence of a just and fair rehabilitation programme.

Greenpeace Indias executive director Ravi Chellam said as part of civil society, they condemned the inauguration of the Sardar Sarovar Dam and stood in solidarity with the Narmada Bacchao Andolan (NBA) which ""displayed incredible courage and resilience, even now as they refuse to leave their homes by protesting peacefully in Jal Satyagraha"".

""This is tragically so despite a long struggle by civil society and activists, and the Supreme Court orders passed in favour of those likely to be affected,"" it added.

It said the ""so-called development project"" comes at an immeasurable cost when considered in terms of the dislocation and debasement caused to countless men, women and children, their hearths and homes, besides the destruction of forests, biodiversity and ecosystems.

The project ""signals ruin not development for tens of thousands of unsuspecting, hapless and poor farmers and Advasis, in the absence of a just, genuine and fair rehabilitation programme"", it said.

While inaugurating the dam, the prime minister said no other project in the world had faced so many hurdles as this ""engineering miracle"" which many people had ""conspired to stop"".

Nearly 56 years after its foundation was laid, the Sardar Sarovar Dam, which was mired in controversies and faced stiff opposition from affected villagers, became a reality today after Modi unveiled the plaque to launch it. PTI SKV SMN SMN

**Russia keen on joint development of MiG-29 K jets with Indian firms** 

 ______

**Now, Congress's Manish Tewari makes abusive remarks against PM, triggers row** 

 ______ 
Willing to apologise for using a 'colloquial' Hindi phraseHowever will PM promise to unfollow those who heap unmentionable abuse on women??? — Manish Tewari (@ManishTewari) 1505660135000

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Manish Tewari on Sunday triggered a row with a twitter post using abusive language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , evoking sharp reactions from the BJP and the twitterati demanding an apology from Sonia Gandhi Tewari is the second Congress leader after party general secretary Digvijaya Singh to come under fire for using foul language against Modi. Singh had recently retweeted a post which contained expletives against the prime minister.In his post, Tewari wrote in Hindi in Roman script about how Modi ""befooled"" people and that, ""Even Mahatma cannot teach MODI Deshbhakti (patriotism)"".He was responding to a remark made by a person on the micro blogging website that patriotism is in the DNA of Modi and even Mahatma Gandhi cannot teach him that. It was made in response to a short video clip put up by Tewari about a gaffe committed by Modi abroad when he had started walking even as the national anthem was being played.Reacting sharply, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said a desperate Congress and its leaders have ""lost their mental balance"" after being rejected by people. He said they are using foul language against the prime minister as they have run out of logic to counter him.""A depressed Congress has become an expired bubble of abuses. When they do not have logic they take to such cheap language. The Congress has been rejected by the people and since then its leaders have lost their mental balance. They are in need of urgent psychiatric treatment,"" Naqvi told PTI.He said it is unfortunate that they have forgotten the dignity and decorum politics requires while targeting the BJP and the prime minister.""It shows the mental state of the Congress and its leaders and the Congress leadership under Sonia Gandhi should apologise for this,"" he said.By using such language, leaders like Tewari will destroy whatever little support base the Congress has been left with, he said.Another BJP leader Subramanian Swamy alleged that someone else is ""orchestrating"" Congress' abusive attack as Tewari has the reputation of being sober and sensitive.""The only person I think who has the authority to make (such a remark) is Rahul Gandhi, who can say anything anytime.""""There is a genuine frustration in the Congress that despite all the policy failures that they are trying to point out the country is solidly with the BJP,"" he said.The issue led to a major row on the social media with trolls targeting Tewari. A hashtag ""#CongLeaderAbusesPM"" was also used and evoked sharp reactions from twitterati.As criticism mounted, Tewari took to the twitter to say he put out the video ostensibly showing PM walking while National Anthem was playing in response to someone's tweet and that he meant no offence to Modi.""If brouhaha is over Hindi phrase in colloquial-used to describe idiocity ¬hing more. In this case of person who put PM over Mahatma,"" he said in a series of tweets.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said Sonia Gandhi and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi should tender apology for Tewary's action otherwise it would be construed that it had their tacit approval.Another BJP spokesman Sambit Patra said since Tewari is the spokesperson of the party Sonia and Rahul needed to explain why he did so.He used the words of Congress leader Jairam Ramesh to hit out at the Congress, saying ""the Sultanate has gone but the Sultans still behave as if they are still Sultans"".Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had stirred a major controversy a few days ago by posting a tweet that used abusive language against the prime minister, prompting the BJP to demand an apology from the opposition party for the ""filthy abuse"".Singh later disowned it, saying retweets are not endorsements, but the trolls did not spare him.""Retweets are never endorsements. This is the basic principle of Twitter,"" he said after the controversy erupted.""I have said it is not mine. I have disowned it. I have not used those words,"" he clarified.

**CAG report finds massive irregularities at premier astronomy institute** 

 ______ 
NAINITAL: Major irregularities relating to funds and promotions of employees have been unearthed at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), a premier autonomous research facility under the Union ministry of science and technology.The findings in an audit report indicate that 26 posts were created without the approval of the Union ministry of finance, payments to employees were irregular, upgradation of payscale of the institute’s then director was made without due authorization, and 14 scientists were promoted arbitrarily, all causing financial losses that allegedly run into crores of rupees.The audit report, prepared by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) was obtained through an RTI application by a Nainital resident.“The creation of 26 posts without the approval of the Union finance ministry was in violation of rules and resulted in irregular payment of salary and allowances to the employees recruited in excess of sanctioned posts,” said the report.The salary of then ARIES director Ram Sagar was also allegedly upgraded twice, in April 2004 and August 2006, without the approval of the Union ministry. “Neither the governing council of ARIES nor the department of science and technology were competent to upgrade posts or pay scales of employees. Total monetary benefit of Rs 43.73 lakh was allowed to the former director,” added the report.Sagar, who is facing serious criminal charges, was sent to jail by a special CBI court in Dehradun on October 28, 2014, before being granted bail by Uttarakhand High Court in December that year.The CAG report stated that ARIES, with the approval of its governing council in April 2008 “devised its own policy” under which promotions were granted to 14 scientists “in violation” of central government rules, resulting in “inadmissible payments” of Rs 65.42 lakh.Other financial irregularities include failed recovery of Rs 20.82 lakh from contractors as labour cess, recovery of Rs 83.29 lakh work contract tax resulting in “undue benefits” to contractors, expenditure of Rs 53.90 lakh on development of a telescope which produced no results and another Rs 35.90 lakh spent on procuring equipment which was not used for cited purposes. The CAG report also criticized ARIES for not maintaining project files.The institute in Nainital, which specializes in observational astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences, had received much praise from PM Narendra Modi in 2016 for playing a key role in building Asia's largest general purpose optical telescope, which was activated by him remotely while on a visit to Belgium in March last year.The 50-year old State Observatory at Nainital was rechristened on March 22, 2004 as ARIES. The Observatory came into existence at Varanasi on April 20, 1954 and was moved to Nainital in 1955, and later to its present location in 1961 at an altitude of 1,951 m at Manora peak south of Nainital.Ravindra Kumar, registrar of the institute, told TOI, ""Our finance committee is scheduled to meet on September 18, while the governing council will meet a day later, and the matter will come up for discussion. We have filed our response to the Union finance ministry, and cannot comment on it further at the moment.”

**World Bank refused funds for Sardar Sarovar Dam, Gujarat’s temples donated money: PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Gujarat’s temples gave money when the World Bank refused funds for the Sardar Sarovar project, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, attacking a “list of people” who allegedly tried to stall the world’s second largest concrete dam. (Highlights)

The dam is the centrepiece of the multi-billion dollar Narmada Valley development project, one of India’s most grand schemes that is expected to provide water and power to millions of people in four states.

It is also crucial to the BJP’s campaign plans in Modi’s home state which goes to the polls this year, with chief minister Vijay Rupani terming as “Gujarat’s lifeline” the second biggest dam after the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States.

“I have a list of people who came in way of Sardar Sarovar dam but I won’t politicise the matter...we were determined that the project will continue,” Modi told a public rally after inaugurating the dam, whose foundation was laid by the country’s first prime minister, Jawharlal Nehru, in 1961.

“A massive misinformation campaign was launched against the project. The World Bank which had earlier agreed to fund the project, refused to give loan for it raising environmental concerns.But, with or without the World Bank, we completed the massive project on our own,” he told a public rally about 55 kms from the dam site in Dabhoi town of Vadodara district.

He said the World Bank was later “compelled” to give the Green Award to Gujarat for its environment-friendly rehabilitation work in earthquake-affected Kutch.

The inauguration of the dam coincided with Modi’s 67th birthday and also the day dedicated to Vishwakarma, the Hindu god of engineering.

PM Narendra Modi reviews the construction of the ‘Statue of Unity’, which is a tribute to Sardar Patel. (@narendramodi/Twitter)

Modi did not name anybody but said the scheme progressed when “people who keep (the) country above party were in power and slowed down when those who keep party above the country ruled”.

The PM went on to say that Sardar Patel did not get the credit he deserved after Independence for some reasons but his government was committed to ensure that the Iron Man’s “name, works and inspiration” remain eternal.

“You all know me. I neither think small nor do I take small projects. This is why I decided to build a statue of Sardar Patel. The ‘Statue of Unity’ will be double the height of America’s Statue of Liberty,” he said.

Modi’s visit to Gujarat is the second in less than a week after he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the state and launched the bullet train project. Opposition parties say the projects are timed with the Gujarat elections in mind.

The BJP has been trying to project the previous Congress regime at the Centre as one of the biggest hurdles.

The project is also seen as an answer to placate the powerful Patidars, who have been up against the BJP over issue of OBC status.

The Narmada Bachao Andolan, led by activist Medha Patkar, has been opposing the project citing environmental concerns.

The NBA says the dam displaced 320,000 people -- many of them poor tribal farmers who were not resettled on agricultural land -- and disrupted the lives of tens of thousands more. Thousands have still not been compensated, it said.

Modi appeared to woo the tribals whose “struggle has made us realise the dream”.

“We should remember our freedom fighters from the tribal communities who gave a strong fight to colonialism...We salute them, the government wants to make a digital museum for the tribal freedom fighters,” he added.

Even as Modi was inaugurating the dam, Patkar’s ‘Jal Satyagraha’ – a symbolic protest held by activists half-sumerged in water -- demanding rehabilitation of 40,000 families entered the third day on Sunday.

“Today is a very sad day for India, and for one of our biggest peoples’ movements and struggle - the Narmada Bacchao Andolan,” Ravi Chellam, executive director at Greenpeace India said in a statement.

“The project... signals ruin not development for tens of thousands of unsuspecting, hapless and poor farmers,” Chellam added.

454,"&gt; Project planned be completed by December 2023, preponed target of testing &amp; commissioning is August 2022.

- So that means that the tracks will be up by 2022, which is about 5 years from now. 

- If we work backwards, it is fair to assume that by 2020, we should have quite a few pillars being erected somewhere between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, since this is going to an elevated platform. 

- Working backwards even more, we should have a bunch of land being cleared by 2018, since these pillars need to be erected on something. 

In other words, folks living between Ahmedabad and Mumbai can give us an idea of the success or failure of the project sometime next year. If they do not see land being cleared, or more laborers being hired in the next couple of months, it is probably going to be a failure yet again. 

I think HSR is great for India. I am just doubtful the Modi government can actually get it build on time. Modi likes the PR, but not so good on the implementation.

**Medha Patkar ends jal satyagrah as Narmada Dam opens, says struggle to continue** 

 ______ 
Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) leader Medha Patkar and 36 others affected by the Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) in Madhya Pradesh ended their ‘jal satyagrah’ Sunday evening, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated one of the dams of the project to the nation in Gujarat.

The dam became a reality 56 years after the then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru laid its foundation.

Patkar and her supporters had started jal satyagraha at Chhota Barda Ghat, about 350 km southwest of Bhopal on Friday. Although the protest ended at about 6 pm on Sunday, the NBA leaders said they would continue their agitation for proper rehabilitation of the SSP affected people.

“We wish to convey that our struggle will continue. Prime Minister may want to close the chapter, but it is not, since the people of Narmada Valley have not received their full entitlement and not all is lost,” the NBA said in a press release.

“The drama of dedication of Sardar Sarovar Project to the nation on Prime Minister’s birthday was a complete failure. This was evident by the fact that except for Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, no other BJP ruled state’s CM turned up unlike the announcement. About 2000 priests from Varanasi didn’t turn up either to perform aarti despite the announcement. We believe this is a victory of our struggle,” it said.

While Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan congratulated the PM on completion of the project, social activists took to social media to express their anger and anguish. Chouhan congratulated the Prime Minister on Twitter.

I take this opportunity to thank PM @narendramodi Ji for his vision, direction &amp; determination in #SardarSarovarDam's successful completion. — ShivrajSingh Chouhan (@ChouhanShivraj) September 17, 2017

Others were not so charitable. Social activist Sachin Kumar Jain tweeted ahead of the PM dedicating the dam to the nation, saying, “Life of about 40000 families of Madhya Pradesh is being annihilated in the name of development.”

One Bhupesh Patidar tweeted, “Birthday of one man caused life in risk for 40000 families.”

Arun Yadav, president of the Madhya Pradesh unit of Congress attacked the PM on SSP issue.

In a statement Yadav said the PM dedicated to the nation an incomplete project. Thus, he cheated not only the country but also Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel whom the PM recalled during his speech.

“The central and state governments conveniently overlooked the unbearable pain and anguish of displaced people in Madhya Pradesh. It seems the way the PM has dedicated the SSP dam he considers himself chief minister of Gujarat who has eyes of the ensuing assembly elections over there”, said Yadav.

**There are 1.77 million homeless in India, but the State is blind to them** 

 ______ 
They can be found everywhere but somehow the Indian State fails to notice them. They are the homeless people of India. According to the government’s definition, homeless or houseless are those who live in “the open or roadside, pavements, in hume-pipes, under flyovers and staircases, or in the open in places of worship, mandaps, railway platforms etc.” Yet when it comes to providing them the basic needs, governments have been failing to spend even their allocated funds. There are 1.77 million homeless people in India.

Last week, the Supreme Court took the Centre and states to task, saying that there should be an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the money disbursed by the Centre to the states for a scheme under the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), and observed that these funds, which are meant for a specific purpose, should not be diverted.

This is not the first time the SC has rapped the Centre. In 2016, the apex court slammed the Centre and states for their lackadaisical approach in providing shelters to the poverty-stricken in urban areas despite availability of sufficient funds.

It had also observed that the mission of the NULM scheme “remains a distant dream even after lapse of a long period.”

The NULM was launched in September 2013 to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households. The Centre had earlier told the court that an amount of Rs 1,000 crore, released under the NULM, does not pertain only to urban homeless but to other activities also.

The good news is that there has been an overall decline in the houseless population from the last Census. While there has been a 28% decline reported from rural India, there has been a 20% increase in houseless people living in the cities. But still there is a long way to go.

But only spending money will not solve the problem. Here’s what needs to be done.

First, the State needs to identify and address the structural causes of homelessness; second, a national moratorium on forced evictions and demolitions should be introduced; third, enhanced policy coherence and convergence between housing schemes in urban and rural areas and schemes for the provision of water and sanitation; fourth, the central and state governments should put in place effective and timely mechanisms to collect data on evictions, including with disaggregation of the persons who are evicted by age, gender, disability, caste and religion.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target for the nation – every Indian must have a house by 2022. This is a tall order. However it is possible if the state undertakes the right sort of planning and judicious spending of funds.

condolences to his family. President Ram Nath Kovind tweeted, ""Sad at demise
of a great air warrior &amp;amp; Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh. Condolences
to his family &amp;amp; IAF community.""

The only Air Force officer to be promoted to five-star rank, Arjan Singh was
famous for his role in the 1965 India-Pakistan war. ""It was to his credit that
despite initial setbacks, we were able to 'overcome and overwhelm' the enemy
and spoil their design to annex Jammu and Kashmir,"" Air Chief Marshal BS
Dhanoa said.

Arjan Singh was conferred the rank of the Marshal of the Air Force in 2002

With the death of Arjan Singh, India has no five star ranked military
officers, equivalent to a Field Marshal in rank.

**For PM Modi's Birthday, Andhra Pradesh Farmers Send 68 Paise Cheques** 

 ______ 
An NGO from Andhra Pradesh send 68 paise cheque to highlight the plight of
farmers in the region.

**Hyderabad: **

While wishes poured in for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he turned 68 today,
a non-profit group from Andhra Pradesh used the occasion to highlight the
plight of farmers in the region.

Rayalaseema Saguneeti Sadhana Samiti (RSSS), a group working for drought-hit
farmers in Rayalaseema, sent 400 cheques of 68 paise each to the prime
minister to highlight the agrarian crisis faced by four districts in the
region.

""We are sending 68 paise cheques as a token to draw your attention to our
backwardness,"" RSSS co-convener Yerva Raamachandra Reddy said.

The group claimed that Rayalaseema remains one of the most backward regions in
the country despite the abundant resources there. Kurnool, Anantpur, Chittoor
and Kadapa districts are deprived of water despite rivers like Krishna and
Penna passing through it.

Farmers from Rayalaseema sent 400 cheques of 68 paise each to PM Modi.

Among these districts, Anantpur receives the second lowest rainfall after Thar
desert in the country.

They claim that politicians are not interested in the farmer crisis in
Rayalaseema due to the lack of political influence it carries. ""Both Chief
Minister Chandrababu Naidu and opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy are from
Rayalaseema... Yet they are not focusing attention on the region because there
are only 54 Mla seats here and the rest are in coastal region. So they focus
all their attention there,"" a member said.

With state leaders showing apathy to their plight, the farmers hope that their
unique protest will help bring centre's attention to the region.

**As US dithers, India-Japan reviewing South China Sea position?** 

 ______ 
Modi-Abe summit was intended to address Chinese expansionism in the form of its OBOR +

as the previous two summit declarations +

The omission of SCS +

NEW DELHI: While a lot of what India and Japan discussed at the One Belt One Road ) initiative, the two countries also allowed a concession to Beijing by avoiding any explicit mention of South China Sea (SCS).This is particularly significantspecifically referred to SCS while reaffirming commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight. This time though the successful resolution to the Doklam dispute, which saw China agreeing to India's demand to stop road construction to where Beijing believes the India-Bhutan-China tri-junction is, and Japan's preoccupation with North Korea meant a more restrained response in their joint statement to the security challenge in SCS.The Modi government introduced explicit mentions of SCS in its joint declarations, first with the US in 2014, in line with a more assertive Act East policy and to maintain a deliberate ambiguity in its position on China's maritime territorial disputes with its neighbours. This was also in keeping with exhortations by several Asean nations for India to increase its profile in the region.may also partly have resulted from what many see as the indifference of the US under President Donald Trump to the situation in SCS . As strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney says, India and Japan are now faced with very difficult choices on SCS with Trump effectively giving Beijing a ""free pass"" to act in whatever manner it wants to. ""The omission is especially significant given the reference to the SCS in the 2015 and 2016 joint statements. India and Japan cannot ignore the fact that the US has no clear policy on SCS,"" says Chellaney.There is, however, a view that North Korea's provocations may force Trump to rethink his options. To be sure, the US is now said to be planning regular freedom of navigation operations in SCS. However, reports from Southeast Asia suggest that, with Trump and the international community focused on North Korea, China is quietly consolidating its territorial claims in SCS.According to Chellaney, under Obama, the US allowed China to change the status quo by force in the SCS without incurring any international costs, thereby emboldening Chinese actions in the Himalayas and the East China Sea, and Trump has shown no inclination to challenge Beijing in SCS. ""Under Trump, the US has no desire to seek a return to status quo ante in the SCS. As a result, China is consolidating its position in the SCS, even as the US symbolically undertakes freedom-of-navigation operations in the region,"" he says.There was a mention of UNCLOS in the 2017 India-Japan joint statement for sure and the same paragraph also reiterated the determination to work together for stability, peace and development in the Indo-Pacific. It's still a dilution though of the 2016 document which said the two PMs ""regarding the South China Sea"" stressed the importance of resolving the disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law including the UNCLOS. This time foreign secretary S Jaishankar said the Indo-Pacific reference addressed the issue without mentioning specific geographies.

**Rat poison mixed in water at madrassa run by Hamid Ansari’s wife?** 

 ______ 
AGRA: In an incident which former Vice President Hamid Ansari 's wife, Salma Ansari , called ""shocking and scary"", some unidentified men allegedly mixed rat poison in the water supply of Madrassa Chacha Nehru in Aligarh that houses 4,000 children. The institution located in the heart of the city is run by Al Noor Charitable Society which Ansari's wife heads. Police have lodged an FIR in the case under IPC sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and are on the lookout for two unidentified persons.Chairperson of the society, Salma Ansari, told TOI that she was shocked to learn about the incident and asked the madrassa warden to file a police complaint. ""Following the incident, we have decided to install CCTV cameras in the 18-year-old charitable institution which has 4000 students on its rolls,"" she said.Aligarh senior superintendent of police Rajesh Pandey said, ""Fortunately, a student spotted the miscreants and alerted the warden. We have collected water samples which will be sent to forensic science laboratory (FSL) for tests on Saturday."" Giving details of the incident, madrassa warden Junaid Siddiqui said, ""One of our students, Mohammad Afzal, who stays in the hostel, went to drink water from a common water tap on Friday evening. He spotted two men mixing some tablets in the tank. When he asked them what they were doing, the other suspect, who was sitting on the madrassa's fence with a country-made pistol, threatened him to keep quiet.""After the duo left, the student picked up the rat poison wrapper left behind by them and alerted the warden. ""The water supply area was immediately cordoned off. And students were asked to drink water from other tanks in the premises,"" the warden told TOI. Chief medical officer at Aligarh's J N Medical College, Dr Ehtisham Ahmad, said that though rat poison can't prove fatal to human beings until it is mixed with an anticoagulant (substance that prevents or reduces coagulation of blood), it could have made the students sick. ""A lot, however, would depend on the quantity of rat poison mixed in the water,"" he added.Hamid Ansari had faced a flak from several BJP leaders, including current VP Venkaiah Naidu, after Ansari, in the last days of his tenure, said Muslims in India were experiencing ""a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity is creeping in"". PM Narendra Modi, too, had reacted to it saying Ansari would ""be free"" to act, talk and work in accordance with his ""basic political ideology and instinct"" after his tenure ended.

**Global hardselling by Rahul Gandhi before Congress takeover** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi’s address at California University is seen by Congress and political Delhi as part of a calculated effort to project him at the global stage ahead of his scheduled take over as president of the grand old party by October end.Notwithstanding the BJP Congress sparring after his address, many feel Gandhi’s outing went off well, without his characteristic faux pas, apart from getting the Lok Sabha strength wrong. The wellpressed white kurta-pyjama and a clean-shaven look, topped with a Nehru jacket also showed Gandhi making conscious efforts to move on from his ‘cultivated careless’ look. His readiness to take charge must have added to his party’s relief.Gandhi’s response to questions on his weakest point — being a dynast — by saying dynasts are a way of life in India, may have triggered a wave of criticism but he was being brutally honest given the increasing hereditary turks in Indian politics.While naming fellow dynasts, he tactically chose to avoid his uncle Sanjay Gandhi’s wife and their son, thriving in the BJP, sparing his critics in the BJP the blues in their attack on the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. While criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s approach, he contrasted the worldviews of the ‘Gandhi-led Congress challenger’ and the ‘Modi-led establishment’ in strikingly measured words. Gandhi even complimented Modi’s better communication skills.While explaining his party’s worst electoral defeat by pointing to the incumbency burden of 10 years, Gandhi chose to be disarmingly candid in saying ‘arrogance’ cost it dearly. Such ‘glasnost’, and highlighting of his ‘perestroika’ in the Congress shows he may be finally learning to tactfully position himself. Blaming BJP propaganda for the ‘reluctant leader’ image indicates Gandhi has learnt the craft of dealing with Yorkers.Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and underlining Congress’ original ahimsa plank was meant to rekindle the enduring global nostalgia for India’s Grand Old Party, now pitted against the BJP. How Congress regimes introduced IITs and how BJP opposed introduction of computers during Rajiv Gandhi regime was meant to tell global audiences about how his party was always reformist.While unveiling his critique of the Modi government, Gandhi chose three Indian topics that get maximum global attention. On Kashmir, he chose to say that the Manmohan Singh government nearly crushed terrorism in the valley and blamed the NDA government and BJP-PDP alliance for ‘reviving’ it. In the aftermath of demonetisation and GST , Gandhi chose to contrast the flipside of Modi mantra of instant, decisive governance with the Congress commitment to economic reforms, rooted in inclusive and welfare approach.

**Bullet Train: Dreamers &amp; visionaries usually win the day, cynics don’t** 

 ______ 
Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft Corporation, is probably not remembered as well as the other `Steve’ of Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs and there are a number of good reasons for this. One particular instance stands out though. He predicted in 2007 that the iPhone has no chance of any significant market share and the Windows Phone would probably corner a greater share. To be fair to Steve (Ballmer that is), he wasn’t the only one predicting doomsday for Jobs’ crowning achievement. Others like the online journal Techcrunch, tech columnists and rivals such as BlackBerry and Nokia also said the same. iPhone, they said, would achieve nothing.We all know what happened after that and and the reason why we remember the iPhone and several other projects and initiatives considered `dumb’ or `expensive’ when they started is the ill-considered and hysterical response to proposed the bullet train service between Mumbai and Ahmedabad.One can understand partisan sniping but the fact this criticism has been propagated by serious journalists and academicians means there is something more at play. Maybe it is Modi Hatred (MH), a peculiar phenomenon prevalent to critics of the government and the BJP and which rears its head whenever it comes to debating discussing prime minister Narendra Modi’s performance or policies.What are the immediate advantages of a bullet train? There are several of them. It could lead to speedier travel between two bustling, business-oriented cities, increase tourist flows, develop the stretch of coastal land that runs between the two states, reduce congestion in Mumbai. The possibilities are endless. Critics say that the flying time between the two cities is about an hour and if you add another one hour to airport waiting time it is two hours and the bullet train is not really faster. Actually, that is not true. As any traveller in Mumbai knows, you need to get to the airport fairly early to avoid hassles at security and check-in counters.These delays are there even if you do a web check in. So, if you factor all that in the two-stop bullet train it is actually quite competitive. Even with the 12-stop train, you will get to Ahmedabad faster from Mumbai.Secondly, everybody is not a flyer. Even with cheap airfares, many people prefer train travel. This is because they may be travelling to other places on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route like Vapi, Surat, Vadodara, Boisar etc. If the pricing is right, this train can cater to them and cut down their travel time substantially. Everything about the bullet train cannot be about financial viability. Rail travel is also about convenience and productivity.If a service cuts down by travel time by half while being slightly dearer on my pocket, would I necessarily spurn it? Many people may decide it is worth the money.Thirdly, as Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman of Feedback Infra Pvt Ltd points out, there is a Make In India component in the agreement with Japan which will kick in in the next couple of years. Localised manufacture and transfer of technology are recognised as twin, complementary objectives under the project, he writes in an article in the Indian Express. One should not forget these benefits.Fourthly, one should not underestimate the impact on the reduction in travel time and the prospects for tourism, especially weekend travel.Will people in the Mumbai suburbs like Virar and Thane shift to further locations on the route and travel to work in Mumbai. With the bullet train, that is now a distinct possibility. What about tourism? Why can’t more beach resorts like Daman, Silvassa open up on that route to take advantage of the shorter travel time between two big cities?Last but not the least. This is a dream project. By this I mean it is a project that is calculated to deliver specific economic benefits while also making Indians feel good about themselves. It is like ISRO’s space launches. It does not deliver any economic benefit to the nation but makes us feel good and proud of our abilities. The bullet train combines this with specific economic advantages. If executed properly across the country, it can have the same impact as Maruti did in the 1980s on automobile industry and rise of the middle class.PM Modi may or may not be a dreamer but he is definitely a disruptor. Like FDR in America of the 1930s who ended that country’s fascination with gold, Modi is trying to fundamentally change the way Indian economic system thinks and operates. Demonetisation GST , electric vehicles and yes, now bullet trains. History will judge whether he is successful or not but this is a momentous occasion for India with all this massive change.Also, history remembers those political and business leaders who are disruptors. FDR, De Gaulle, Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk . PM Modi’s economic policies and programmes will either put him in that pantheon of leaders and disruptors or dump him in the forgotten bin of history. Only time will tell but the omens are looking good for him and his team.

Dedicating the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Dam to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday recollected the obstacles his government had to overcome to successfully complete the project.

Describing the Namrada dam as “an engineering miracle”, PM Modi said that a massive misinformation campaign was launched against the project. He added that because of the obstructions, River Narmada suffered the most. “In the obstructions created by forces against Narmada project, Maa Narmada has suffered the most,” PM Modi said.

The prime minister was addressing a rally in Dabhoi district of Gujarat after inaugurating the Sardar Saovar Dam.

PM Modi said that his government has overcome “all conspiracies” against the Sardar Sarovar Dam to complete the project. “When then government refused funds, we decided World bank or no world bank, we will build Sardar Sarovar with our hands. When world bank refused money for Sardar Sarovar Dam, temples of Gujarat had donated money for the project. We overcame all conspiracies against Maa Narmada to complete the Sardar Sarovar project,” he said. Modi added that Narmada will become a hub of tourism.

PM Modi went on to stress the need for development of water resources in the country. “Nothing is bigger impediment to development than water,” Modi said.

“As Gujarat Chief Minister, I visited BSF post and saw they had no drinking water. I had resolved that I will bring Narmada waters to my country’s Jawan at Pakistan border in Gujarat, 700 km away. When a son gives water to its parched mother earth, what can be a bigger feeling of satisfaction,” he said.

He also expressed his gratitude to tribals for sacrificing their land for the project. “I want to thank Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, and my adivasi brothers who gave up their land,” he said.

Pitching his idea of a “new India”, PM Modi said he will continue to work for the dreams of people. “I will leave no stone unturned to achieve New India like Mahatma Gandhi achieved a new India earlier. I am living for your dreams, I will also exhaust myself to for your dreams; for New India,” he said.

Modi went on to say that he does not believe in doing “small things”. “You know me; I can’t do small things. I don’t think small, don’t do small. With 1.25 billion people with me, I can’t dream small,” he said.
