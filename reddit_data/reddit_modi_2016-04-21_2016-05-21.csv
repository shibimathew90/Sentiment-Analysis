&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday sought to firewall the Gandhis from the escalating controversy over Ishrat Jahan by dismissing as a ""bundle of lies"" BJP's allegations that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi gave direction to then home minister P Chidambaram in the case.Pushing back at BJP over the politically sensitive case, party spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, ""Unlike RSS, Sonia Gandhi or Rahul never intervened or gave any suggestion to the then home minister P Chidambaram or any other person or authority in the government on any administrative matter, including the Ishrat Jahan case.

&gt; * BJP alleged that the Congress president had asked Chidambaram to change the affidavit as part of a political frame-up because ""Sonia could tolerate terrorists but not Modi as PM"".Hitting back at BJP, Surjewala said that Modi should ""stop perpetuating the bundle of lies by using his cronies and pawns to spread false-hoods"" about the role of the Congress president and vice-president in the case.Surjewala reiterated that the PM and the BJP chief need to answer as to ""why they are trying to bypass the judicial findings"" of metropolitan court, Ahmedabad and the division bench of the Gujarat high court, which had held that it was a fake encounter.

&gt;* New Delhi: In a bid to corner the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party MP Anurag Thakur will raise the Ishrat Jahan encounter case in the upcoming Parliament session.

&gt;* Citing a media report which claimed that Chidambaram had in fact signed the first affidavit, which declared Ishrat and three others as terrorists, but gave all four a clean chit a month later as serious amendments were made in the second affidavit also signed by him, Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said Congress, especially Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi, should take responsibility because Chidambaram did so as the party found it not strong enough to fight Modi politically.

&gt;* The first affidavit in the encounter case stated that Ishrat was a LeT operative, who was part of a plot to assassinate the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* Chidambaram had initially claimed that the first affidavit declaring Ishrat and three others as terrorists was filed in the court without his approval, adding that he had made some editorial changes to avoid misinterpretation when the matter was brought to his notice.

&gt;* Chidambaram, however, completely altered his stance in the second affidavit, saying that intelligence inputs on Ishrat and the three others did not constitute conclusive proof and favoured a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the encounter.

&gt;* According to India resident Prasanto K. Roy, local governments are demanding that administrators of WhatsApp groups (the latest beneficiaries of the encryption rollout) register with the local magistrate, and will apparently hold them accountable for any ""irresponsible remarks"" or ""untoward actions"" by members of the group.

&gt;* And, indeed, that is the case here.It would seem to me the tension was created by the alleged molestation, the government's lack of interest in investigating/punishing the wrongdoer and the killing of five people.

&gt;* The government appears to be more interested in saving itself from its constituency, so the obvious move is to shut down any communication platform that it can't monitor or control.

&gt;* It can't kill WhatsApp, so it's demanding to be inserted into these conversations -- either directly or by lurking just offscreen whispering legal threats.Not only that, but the quelling of dissent extends to the government itself.

&gt;* The flier also notes punishment awaits government employees who find the registration demand heavy-handed.Looking beyond this local dispute that has managed to drag in the world's most popular messaging service, one can see why it is essential that citizens have communication platforms that keep the government locked out.

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI/NAINITAL: In a major embarrassment to the Modi government, the Uttarakhand high court on Thursday struck down the decision to impose central rule in the state and restored CM Harish Rawat's government, asking it to face a floor test on April 29 to prove its majority.The court, which had said on Wednesday that ""even the President can be terribly wrong"", delivered an order laced with strongly critical remarks about central rule being the last resort and that dismissal of elected governments bred cynicism in citizens.Declaring that the ""draconian 356"" should not have been imposed, a bench of Chief Justice K M Jospeh and Justice V K Bist said, ""The said party (BJP) was a direct beneficiary of Article 356, which was not justified as there was no riot or violence in the state.

&gt;* ""The decision buoyed Congress spirits and the party hailed the order as a win for democracy while BJP chafed at the court's caustic observations, expressing surprise over the bench offering relief to Rawat despite a sting allegedly implicating him in horse trading and the ""illegal"" manner in which the appropriation bill was declared passed.But the last word in the game of political intrigue and legal battles has not been said as the Centre will approach the Supreme Court on Friday seeking a review of the high court order nullifying the March 27 decision.

&gt;* ""Harish Rawat was in a minority and will remain in minority on April 29 too,"" BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said amid claims of his colleagues about ""successful"" outreach to MLAs supporting the just-restored CM.This should set the stage for a scramble for MLAs, especially the six belonging to the ""others"" lot.The high court did not mince its words in taking the Cenre to task.

&gt;* When the Centre's counsel refused to state whether central rule would be revoked, the bench snapped, ""You are acting like a private party.

&gt;* If they don't, the odds shift towards Congress which is banking on six other MLAs and a BJP rebel.The court backed a single-judge bench order directing a floor test, saying this ""should not have been avoided"".

&gt;* The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has served a notice to Punjab government for axing 96,000 trees for widening Zirakpur-Bathinda highway (NH64).

&gt;* The state government and the Punjab Pollution Control Board have been asked to submit a reply by Friday.

&gt;* According to the forest department, the trees axed in Mohali, Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala and Bathinda included sheesham, neem, arjuna, brahma drek, melia, keekar and eucalyptus.

&gt;* Dr Aggarwal argued that the green cover has been axed without any planning for future needs or expansion or concern for the environment.

&gt;* Moreover, the government has committed compensatory plantation in the Kandi area which is far off from the districts where green cover has been depleted, he said.

&gt;* Maintaining distance from the media following him, he refused to comment on any issue, including the developments in neighbouring Uttarakhand where the high court struck down president's rule and restored the Congress government.

&gt;* Later in the day, Gandhi visited the district party office and held parleys with them on various issues and local problems.

&gt;* On the same day, election strategist Prashant Kishore, lined up to revive party's fortunes, held a meeting with office bearers of various frontal organisations in the state capital.

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government may sound positive about passage of the bill to introduce the goods and services tax in the second part of the budget session of Parliament.However, the arithmetic in the Upper House shows that the BJP led National Democratic Alliance won't be able to get the 122nd Constitution Amendment Bill passed without support from the opposition Congress party even after August, by when 30% of the seats will be filled with new members.The Congress has once again made it clear that it will not support the proposed legislation in its present form, sticking firmly to its demand for three changes.

&gt;* Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala reiterated the party's stand on Wednesday and clarified that the government had not reached out since Parliament went into a recess on March 16.

&gt;* Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu maintains the GST bill will be passed in the second half of budget session even as other ministers are not so confident.A Constitutional amendment bill has to be passed with a two-thirds majority of those present and voting in both Houses of Parliament separately and must win approval from half the state assemblies.Although the NDA's presence in the Upper House will improve with the entry of 75 members in August - including seven nominated members - the arithmetic for the government will still not change significantly.

&gt;* The BJP's strength in the 245-member Rajya Sabha currently is 47.

&gt;* Irrespective of the number of seats it wins, BJP will still fall short of the two-thirds figure of 163.

&gt; * Kher has spoken up strongly in support of the government on the tolerance vs anti tolerance debate was again in news in recently when he made an attempt to reach NIT Srinagar and was prevented from doing so, amid the controversy and student unrest following India's defeat in the cricket match against West Indies.The Modi government rejigged the IGNCA Board of Trustees last week replacing Chinmay Garekhan with Rai and bringing in Sonal Mansingh, lyricist Prasoon Joshi among the 19 member board.

&gt; * IGNCA was set up in 1985 in memory of the former PM Indira Gandhi and is visualised as a centre encompassing the study and experience of all the arts.If Kher cited several other preoccupations and opted out of the race, Jagmohan who was also originally proposed as a member of the IGNCA Board of Trustees is also learnt to have declined the position.

&gt; * This, according to the action plan, will totally eradicate poverty from India in the next 16 years and also create 175 million new jobs.

&gt; * The Uttarakhand High Court Bench headed by Chief Justice KM Joseph made this observation, as quoted in The Times of India: The soul of the matter is whether it is open to the Central government to get rid of state governments, supplant or uproot the democratically-elected government, introduce chaos, undermine (the) confidence of the little man who stands with a white paper to cast his vote braving the snow, heat and rain.

&gt; * The rebels and the BJP claimed the budget was passed illegally without a vote, when a vote was demanded.

&gt;* Savvy investors will see the opportunities India has to offer them in the energy as the United States, Europe and Japan are seeing an economic slowdown coupled with a lowering of demand because of greater efficiencies in consumption, he said.

&gt;* As an example, he cited the program to replace the 20 million agricultural pumps, many of them run on diesel, with more efficient and less polluting models, which could save the equivalent of 70 billion units of electricity.

&gt;* Despite the massive investments in renewable energy, India will also depend on coal especially for baseline needs to ensure power availability when other sources become unavailable, Goyal said.

&gt;* In January French President Francois Hollande and Modi laid the foundation stone for the ISA headquarters at Gurgaon.

&gt;* On Friday Goyal and French Environment and Energy Minister Segolene Royale will be hosting a high-level meeting on the ISA on the sidelines of the signing ceremony for the Paris Climate Change agreement.

115,"Every other economist would caution to take India’s GDP (gross domestic product) numbers with a pinch of salt. That has been so for a year since the Narendra Modi government introduced new measure to count the GDP (based on Gross Value Added (GVA) method instead of the earlier one based on factor cost and changed the base year of GDP calculation to 2011-12 from 2004-05

The new method of GDP instantly lifted the country’s GDP growth to 7.3 percent in fiscal year 2015 compared with 5.5 per cent under the old series. For the Modi government, the higher GDP number was euphoric to support its claims that the economy has indeed turned the corner to the high-growth trajectory, becoming world's fastest growing major economy even beating China’s growth rate (though the size of Chinese economy is five times more than that of India.)

One of the major factors that benefited the Modi government in the past year was the crash in oil prices, which helped lessen the burden on import bill and the inflation. But, except this, there has not been any marked improvement in the growth triggers in the domestic market regardless of what the GDP number shows.

This is probably the reason that prompted Rajan to question the new methodology to calculate the GDP numbers. Clearly, it is time for the Modi government to pay attention to the 'skeptics' and look at the economy in a more realistic manner.

The majority of newspaper journalists are socially liberal (not leftist), economically they could be left of center, centrist or right of center. Socially, worldwide, journalists fall into the liberal category. So if stuff like beef or reservation or free speech comes in, you know which side they will take - and that will be opposed to one party.

When it comes to loyalty to parties, that too happens but this disease is there for senior journalists. Affinity? The majority would be anti-BJP. Before the pre-eminence of BJP, they were anti Congress. Or anti Communist. But Babri demolition made journalists switch camps. Gujarat 2002 made a lot of others do that. The right way to think about them though is not pro-Congress or AAP etc, but anti-BJP. The social agenda of BJP, which journalists are exposed to directly (from the horse's mouth, actually) means they know what huge sections of BJP and RSS want, it is opposed to their own liberal agenda, and they will oppose BJP on those aspects. On the economic front, however, a lot of them are pro-capital, and that means when BJP does a good job on the economy, they can't help but appreciate it. Which is why if Modi does a solid job on economy, mediamen will quieten down on social stuff - they like it too much. Almost every liberal journalist though, if you ask them directly what they think about Congress, they will abuse the party. They end up supporting it because they are more anti-BJP than anti-Congress.

The junior journalists are a new breed. They do not give a fuck. They do not even pretend to understand that journalists are 'supposed' to be neutral, even they get all activist. They have bad language, bad principles, and are in it as a career. They will suck up to any politician, any businessman, and see nothing wrong in it. 

Arnab is a mirror to the society. He shows us what the new audiences want, entertainment. But every TV journalist falls for it - the need to gather viewership means even the decent, polite ones have to pretend to be aggressive. Barkha, Rajdeep etc are people who have fallen for the magic of the simple soundbite, the trendy hashtag. They claim they are not like Arnab, but they have all fallen to the demand for TRP. Arnab is just the most shameless at simplifying everything into us-vs-them.

Nobody can be trusted. They are not doing it deliberately. Its extreme incompetence, coupled with the need for speed and TRP - which means that the louder, noisier, the more controversial you are, the happier your proprietors. That means errors, basic journalistic principles being ignored, complex issues distilled into capsule form, shouting over experts...

129,"sorry for that:
As violations of freedom of expression pile up, how productive is it to defend freedom on the ground of tolerance for dissent? Marking out an opinion as dissent paradoxically enables the consolidation of the mainstream consensus. There is a clear shift in the arguments deployed to curtail free expression of ideas from hurt sentiments to truth. Such a shift is taking place in a public culture which requires individuals to have opinions, but is incapable of sustaining critical dialogue.

The political resolution adopted at the recent national executive meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared that refusal to hail Bharat was tantamount to disrespecting the Constitution. Party leaders and ministers have consistently qualified their support for freedom of expression to exclude any activity critical of the country and the only utterance of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue was to castigate the agitations over the clampdown of dissent as “distractions” from the agenda of development. Convinced that the “JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) moment” is to its advantage, the BJP intends to play the game of anti-nationalism and simultaneaously blame victims and opponents for creating diversions. While the list of violations of freedom of expression in India over the past two decades runs long, the breakneck speed with which instances are now piling up makes it imperative to look beyond the violations and ask what is distinctive about the current debate over freedom and dissent. Why do these attacks on individuals and institutions have such popular traction as can be ascertained from the public response at offline and online forums?

Right to Dissent

Op-ed columns and editorials of (primarily English language) newspapers seem to run on a track parallel to the debates on television channels and social media platforms. On the one hand, leading commentators as well as editorials have reiterated the classic liberal argument for tolerance, that is, no idea, however offensive, marginal or unconventional in the face of public morality and discourse ought to be restricted unless there is a clear risk of tangible harm to others in society. On the other hand, free exchange of ideas enriches public discourse, hence, protection of freedom of expression and tolerance of dissent is required of any democracy. However, this argument seems to lack persuasive appeal at the present juncture, met as it is with impatient dismissal; rather it has the paradoxical effect of both creating and widening the gap between the mainstream and the marginal
Consider the issues on which the views and activities of individuals and organisations, indeed entire institutions like JNU, are being called anti-national—Afzal Guru’s execution, death penalty, the Kashmir dispute, insurgencies in the North East, the record of the Indian armed forces in conflict areas, including the human rights violations enabled by the provisions of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts, the phenomenon of Naxalism in predominantly Adivasi belts of the country or the practices and beliefs of Hinduism. In each of these, the public discourse is already marked by a range of perspectives which have generated a rich and ongoing political and intellectual dialogue. This is evident from not only scholarly research, media commentaries and investigative reportage but significantly include the state’s own reports, commissions and parliamentary debates.

Through the catch-all category of antinationalism, this dialogue is sought to be erased from the public sphere. The modus operandi in every flare-up is strikingly similar, that is, to use the arm of the state and the media, especially personalised new media platforms, to create public frenzy around specific statements or slogans. Through this frenzy, certain views and perspectives are first projected as hitherto unheard and unacceptable, whereas the favoured perspective is repeated as the truth and a matter of common sense. Thus, marking out an opinion or argument as dissent is a process which itself produces the mainstream consensus but presents it as extant. Thereby, a range of already existing perspectives are rendered unthinkable; entire issues are sought to be removed from the realm of discussion and hence politics. Formal reiteration of the right to dissent thus papers over a process of drawing new boundaries within the public discourse. Defending those under attack on the grounds of the right to dissent ends up consolidating these boundary lines, instead of making a convincing case for tolerance.

Insult to Indian/Hindu Culture

This has been made possible by a clear shift from the previously popular language of “hurt sentiments,” “insult to Indian/Hindu culture” or the danger of westernisation of Hindu culture used to justify restrictions on freedom of expression, as seen in the protests against the films Fire and Water, Valentine’s Day celebrations or M F Hussain’s paintings of Hindu goddesses. The language currently deployed is that of truth which axiomatically becomes incontestable.

While an appeal to tolerance is possible if sentiments are hurt, truth need not brook any opposition. Truth is its own reason and refutation is not possible; indeed truth is asserted as a fact wherein facts are delinked from the notion of evidence. “Love jihad” continues to be asserted despite all evidence as a fact. Perumal Murugan was hounded for writing a fictional work about a tradition denied as false by caste and Hindutva groups. In every case of lynching and harassment for consuming or transporting beef, the police have sent the meat for testing, thereby acknowledging the rightness of the assault in case it turned out to be beef. The Minister of Human Resource Development, Smriti Irani’s famous Durga–Mahishasur reference in Parliament proclaimed the truth of Hinduism which ruled out any tradition of worshipping Mahishasur.
Whether it is Kashmir or North East, the complex histories of the formation of Indian nation are deemed as false by simply asserting the fact of the “integrity” of the nation and its borders. The patriotism of the armed forces becomes a truth which automatically falsifies evidence of human rights violations. By branding every critique of development policies as an anti-national conspiracy to stall investments and growth not only are arrests, threats and murder of social activists and journalists justified, development itself gets defined as a fact. It is telling that truth is the weapon used to close off primarily three categories—nation, development and religion—in public discourse, for these are the very categories that have been prised open by the politics and academics of the past decades through the axes of caste, gender, region, ethnicity and ecology.

Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi assertions have achieved not just silent political revolutions, but have created visible countercultures involving heterodox practices and alternative readings of stories and myths which reject monolithic Hinduism. Attention to the specific experiences and histories of regions and minorities have enabled critical evaluation of Indian nationalism. Struggles against the destruction of ecology, livelihoods and culture entailed by a development based on growth and extraction of natural resources indicate loss of faith in the claims of progress. These articulations of heterogeneous and contested experiences are being flattened to produce an alarmingly simplistic narrative of the country masquerading as truth.

Assault on Thought

It has been pointed out that the targeting of individuals and institutes engaged in knowledge and creative production is an assault on thought itself (Patnaik 2016; Mehta 2016). The aim is to restrict the possibility of argumentation and exercise of critical faculties in society. It would be useful to look at what makes such an assault possible at the current moment. While universities are indeed under seige, the record of the education system in nurturing critical thought and dialogue in public discourse is seriously deficient. The expansion of education at all levels in the past three decades has been phenomenal. From 43.57% in 1981 to 64.8% in 2001, literacy levels stood at 74.04% in 2011. Likewise the gross enrolment ratio (GER) moved from 41.9% in 1981 to 58.6% in 2001 to 87.4% in 2014 for middle school (Classes VI–VIII), from 30.09% in 2001 to 52.21% in 2014 for high school (Classes IX–XII) and from 8.1% in 2001–02 to 23.6% in 2014–15 for higher education (18–23 age group)(MoHRD 2014: 23–24; MoHRD 2015: 3).

When questioned about it, Rajan said, “As a central banker who has to be pragmatic, I cannot get euphoric if India is the fastest growing large economy. Our current growth certainly reflects the hard work of the government and the people of the country, but we have to repeat this performance for the next 20 years before we can give every Indian a decent livelihood,”

 “We cannot get carried away by our current superiority in growth for as soon as we start distributing future wealth as though we already have it, we stop doing what we are supposed to do to keep growing, This movie has played too many times in the past for us not to know how it ends.”

Rajan noted that while India is compared to China in reference to economic growth rates, the Chinese economy is five times larger than India’s and the average Chinese citizen is four times richer than the average Indian.

The BJP govt wanted to gloat on the gorwth citing 7.3% even when the processes are still underway, as though we've already attained sustained growth, to which he explained, ""The central and state governments have been creating a platform for strong and sustainable growth, and I am confident the payoffs are on their way, but until we have stayed on this path for some time, I remain cautious.”

Only after the temporary constructions were almost over did the NGT step in and raised a stink. IMO this is more political than anything due to the perceived closeness of Sri sri and modi government which is why everything was blown out of proportion. 

The HC also noted that there were almost 2.5 lakh permanent structures(apartments) in the restricted area which have flouted all norms and that was certainly disastrous for the region. The temporary structures built by the foundation could in no way damage even a fraction of what has already been damaged by these constructions. AoL needed a place to hold the event and the government could have denied the permissions themselves, instead they allowed this land and then flip flopped after the hitjob media outraged. I'm sure they could have allotted some other space if they really thought or cared for the environment.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand will be under President's rule till April 27, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday, holding in abeyance the Uttarakhand High Court order of the previous day which had reinstated the Harish Rawat-led government in the state.A bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Shivakirti Singh passed an interim order directing the central government not to revoke the presidential proclamation till April 27.Analysts said the order came as a shot in the arm for the central government which had been pushed on the defensive by the High Court order that gave Congress an issue to rally around the opposition in Parliament in the second leg of the Budget session, which is set to begin on Monday.The order came after Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi argued for an urgent stay on the HC ruling on the grounds that though the order was passed in open court in presence of all parties, in absence of a written copy it cannot be acted upon by one party to the detriment of another.The copy was not available as the High Court Chief Justice had to rush to Delhi to attend a meeting of state Chief Justices and Chief Ministers which began in the Supreme Court premises on Friday.Rawat, through senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and the assembly speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, vehemently opposed any stay on the High Court ruling, but to no avail.Rohatgi said the Centre had imposed President's rule (on March 27) because the Rawat government had lost majority the day the speaker refused a division of an appropriations Bill jointly demanded by 27 opposition BJP MLAs and nine Congress MLAs, and declared it as passed by the House.He cited an alleged sting aired on TV to claim that the Chief Minister was talking about ""bribing"" MLAs and said that the President could not have turned a blind eye to the ""horse-trading"".Rohatgi said the appropriations Bill was yet to go to the governor for his assent.

&gt; * The President can act if he finds the situation on the ground deteriorating,"" he said.Rohatgi said the court could not sit in judgment on adequacy or sufficiency of material with the President to justify his decision to impose President's rule.Rawat, through Singhvi, rejected the alleged sting and said, ""How can the Chief Minister not function?

&gt; * ""He later offered to desist from functioning as Chief Minister, but the court said it cannot leave a ""power vacuum in the state"".Objecting to Rawat's comments, Rohatgi said, ""How can the Chief Minister say he won't act?

&gt; * But the bench said a presidential proclamation was a matter of ""serious matter"" and that it was inclined to hold the ruling in abeyance ""in the interest of constitutional propriety"".The court then directed the High Court to make a copy of its ruling available by April 26.

141,"Congress coined 'Hindu terror' to woo Muslims, BJP says

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Recent developments in 'Hindutva terror' cases, where key prosecution witnesses recanted and investigators claimed that inquiries were manipulated, has seen BJP launch a concerted attack on Congress, accusing it of concocting 'Hindu terrorism' to play minority politics.The account of US citizen David Headley, a Lashkar operative convicted in the 26/11 case, the change of stance of a key witness in the Malegaon blasts case and fresh revelations about alleged manipulation of the Ishrat Jahan case to obscure the Mumbra teen's terror links have seen BJP virtually accuse Congress of creating a Hindu terror bogey to court the minority vote.

&gt;* ""Use of such phrases by top Congress members even when investigations were not complete and there was no report or a court's verdict raises a big question about their intentions, makes it appear that this was not the natural outcome of investigation.

&gt;* It was a deliberate attempt to play vote bank politics and a case of political prejudice,"" BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi told the media on Friday.Trivedi alleged that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had first expressed the view that saffron extremism was a greater threat to India - an allusion to a Wikileaks cable that came to light in 2010 about Rahul's interaction with the US ambassador.

&gt;* The BJP spokesperson also referred to former home minister Sushil Shinde's remarks about ""Hindu terrorism"", comments denied by the Congress member.Home minister P Chidambaram had overseen a cynical change in the Centre's affidavit on the case relating to Ishrat and three others who were part of a Lashkar module, Trivedi said.Trivedi's salvo followed commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman's comments directly accusing Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul of backing a plan to implicate Narendra Modi in a fake encounter case even if it meant ignoring a terror plot intended to eliminate the then Gujarat chief minister.The hard hitting statements are intended to turn the tables on Congress by using leaks and RTI revelations as BJP members feel UPA era cases were intended to embarrass the saffron party.

&gt;* By suggesting Congress had acted in an ""anti-Hindu"" manner to serve its political ends, BJP leaders are looking to put the main opposition on the defensive.After the Headley testimony and the NIA report, the twists in the Malegaon case where a Hindutva group was named as accused has come handy for BJP which has pointed to comments of retired Maharashtra ATS officials who said original leads pointing to the involvement of SIMI and Pakistan-trained persons were overturned.

146,"Central bank governor's every statement is analysed, dissected and looked in deeply for any possible clues on policy. 

Their power to set interest rates, imo, is second only to politicians power to wage wars. 

Their reading of the economy, its direction and pace is given much more importance than what other economists, journalists , banks or ministers say. 

A PM's speech from red fort (MMS or Modi) isn't taken as seriously as RBI governer's report on monetory policy. 

So if Rajan says anything about economy, specially if it has negative tilt, it can impact the markets and investments much more than if Jaitley or Modi says it. 

The biggest event the world is waiting for at the moment is the next Fed meeting and Yellen's actions. What she does will have a far larger impact then almost any other single event this or next month. 

Now as they say 'it's the economy stupid', so even a seemingly disconnected statement of Rajan may get connected to the markets (bonds, fx and equity), even if it's about political issues. 

An adverserial relationship between the government and central bank will be very harmful for the country. A brilliant governer who isn't at peace with government is worse than a mediocre governer who atleast optically manages to project a harmonious relationship. 

Another example: if jaitley and modi say interest rates are high it doesn't matter much compared to when rajan says it. 

Also if rajan publicly disagrees with a government policy, especially related to economy (which almost anything is) it can have a huge negative impact.  Besides it's not central governor's job to give opinion on everything (although he is entitled to have those opinions privately). Whatever he says publicly is construed to be the view of his seat and not his personal view. That's the reality. ",2016-04-23 16:53:30

Out of curiosity, I decided call on BJP’s senior-most Dalit leader, Fakirbhai Waghela. I read out from the portion on which I wanted his comment, without telling him who was the author. Desperately seeking a ticket to fight polls, Waghela angrily said, “Who the hell is this? Who is the wretched writer? How can he say all this?” Then I quietly dropped the name, and he sulked: “Please don’t put me in trouble. Say, I have nothing to comment as I hadn’t seen the book”, which is what I did.

&gt;* UNITED NATIONS: India and France have launched a programme with $1 trillion potential to help developing countries harness fully their solar resources for a clean energy future to meet the ""biggest challenge humanity has ever faced"".Power minister Piyush Goyal and French environment minister Segolene Royal announced on Friday the solar finance programme that aims to lower the cost of finance and facilitate the flow of more than $1 trillion investment to members of the International Solar Alliance (ISA).A second programme they launched at the ISA meeting held during the signing ceremonies for the Paris Climate Change Agreement here aims to make available solar technology for farmers.

&gt;* The meeting was attended by representatives of over 25 countries including the US, Brazil, Bangladesh and Nigeria.Goyal said the ISA initiatives were in ""response to probably the world's largest challenge humanity has ever faced"".Beyond providing clean energy and dealing with climate change, the harnessing of solar energy was also about energy security, he said.Royal said: ""I would like to emphasise the cooperation we have had with India, which is exceptional.

&gt;* """"We will have to leverage our energies on (building solar) infrastructure,"" she said.

&gt;* The ISA member nations can count on France and India to scale up the programmes for the ""energy of the future"", she added.Goyal said he was confident that the programmes will ensure flow of affordable finance for solar projects and serve the interests of the farming communities in the ISA member countries.Explaining the benefits of solar-rich nations collaborating through the ISA, he said it would provide benefits of scale leading to reduction in prices; promotion of collaboration in research and development; and wider deployment of solar technologies.The ISA is about ""all of us working toward a shared vision, a shared goal to take the solar initiative forward"", he said.The ISA, which was launched at the Paris Climate Change Summit last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande, seeks to empower solar-rich countries located between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn, many of which have at least 300 days of sunshine, and share common challenges and opportunities.During Hollande's visit to India in January, the two leaders laid the foundation stone for the ISA headquarters in Gurgaon.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: India is dispatching a flotilla of warships to the Persian Gulf to add military heft to its ongoing stepped-up diplomatic outreach to countries of the region, while striking a fine balance between Sunni-led Arab states like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait on one hand and the Shiite Iran on the other.Defence ministry sources on Saturday said guided-missile destroyer INS Delhi, stealth frigates INS Tarkash and INS Trikhand, missile frigate INS Ganga and tanker INS Deepak of the western naval fleet will leave Mumbai for Dubai (UAE) on May 3.

&gt; * While defence minister Manohar Parrikar is slated to visit Oman in May, IAF's Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets and IL-78 mid-air refuelling aircraft will also touch down in UAE for an exercise while returning from the Red Flag exercise at the Eielson airbase in Alaska (US) being held from April 28 to May 13.With India's primary area of strategic interest stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait, the country's military establishment is cranking up ties with the Arabstates as well as Iran.

&gt; * ""The visits by our warships and aircraft to the Persian Gulf are aimed at enhancing defence relationships and inter-operability with the countries there as well as showing the Indian flag in this region of strategic importance,"" said an official.

&gt; * This military diplomacy is in tune with the political one to bolster economic and security bonds with a region that has around eight million Indian expatriates, apart from being a big trading partner and major source of energy, but has more than a few regional fault-lines.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia earlier this month, which followed his last year's trip to UAE, both of which have traditional close ties with Pakistan.Then, in a counter-balancing bid, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan visited Shia-majority Iran a few days later.Iran is crucial for India to get access to landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asia through the International North-South Transport Corridor project.The Iranian port of Chabahar, in particular, will help India counter China's assistance in developing the Gwadar port in Pakistan.India and Iran are also poised to revive their long-standing defence ties now after international sanctions against Teheran have been lifted.

&gt; * This is the stern message that the Narendra Modi government has sent to China by playing the Uighur card after China repeatedly blocked India's initiative before the United Nations Sanctions Committee for seeking a ban on Pakistan-based terror mastermind Masood Azhar.

&gt; * The Modi government has issued visas to Uighur dissidents and what has riled the Chinese most is that the Germany-based prominent Uighur dissident Dolkun Isa, whom the Chinese have dubbed as a terrorist, is among the Uighur dissidents who have been given an Indian visa for attending the pro-democracy event in Dharamshala next week.

&gt; * No Indian government has taken on China like this ever before.

&gt; * The Modi government has made a bold foreign policy departure in Indias China diplomacy by playing the Uighur card.

174,"The Uttarakhand HC had struck down the decision to impose central rule in the state and restored CM Rawat's government. The court had asked Harish Rawat to face a floor test on April 29 to prove his majority. The Centre had challenged the verdict in the apex court, which stayed the HC order.

---

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed till April 27 the judgment of the Uttarakhand High Court quashing the imposition of President's rule, giving a new turn to the continuing political drama in the state by restoring the Central rule there.Before passing a brief order, a bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Shiva Kirti Singh recorded an undertaking given by attorney general Mukul Rohatgi that the ""Union of India shall not revoke the Presidential proclamation till the next date of hearing"".The apex court clarified that it was keeping in abeyance the judgment of the High Court till the next date of hearing on April 27 as a measure of balance for both the parties as the copy of the verdict was not made available to the parties.While listing the matter for hearing on April 27, the bench said that the High Court shall provide the judgment passed on Thursday to the parties by April 26 and on the same date the copy of the verdict shall also be placed before the apex court.The Supreme Court's stay has the effect of undoing the revival of the Congress government led by Harish Rawat by the High Court judgement of Thursday.During the hearing, the bench also observed that as a matter of propriety the High Court should have signed the verdict so that it would be appropriate for it to go into the appeal.The apex court issued notice to Harish Rawat and chief seceretary of the state on the petition by Centre challenging the quashing of Presidential proclamation under Article 356 of the Constitution in the state.On Thursday, in a major embarrassment to the Modi government, the Uttarakhand high court had struck down the decision to impose central rule in the state and restored chief minister Harish Rawat's government.The court had asked Harish Rawat to face a floor test on April 29 to prove his majority.The court, which had said on Wednesday that ""even the President can be terribly wrong"", delivered an order laced with strongly critical remarks about central rule being the last resort and that dismissal of elected governments bred cynicism in citizens.Declaring that the ""draconian 356"" should not have been imposed, a bench of Chief Justice KM Jospeh and Justice V K Bist said, ""The said party (BJP) was a direct beneficiary of Article 356, which was not justified as there was no riot or violence in the state.

&gt; * The central government has to work in a completely non-partisan manner and without bias.

&gt; * ""It added, ""In the present case which was set into motion with March 18 as day one and saw a proclamation being issued in less than 10 days brings to the fore a situation where 356 has been used contrary to the law laid down by the apex court.

&gt; * The material (considered for the proclamation) has been found wanting and justifies judicial review.

&gt;* ""Those whom we are inviting are also concerned about the ability of the judicial system in the country to deal with cases and disputes that arise out of such investments.

Irrelevant. Free country. Modi had no control over who endorsed him.

Probabaly not. But even if there is, one can't assume that Modi knew of his deeds. My parents had gone for his pravachan once. Doesn't mean my mom approves of him raping women. 

Anyways, Modi dislikes him. Didn't help him in anyways. Rajsthan and Gujarat police (BJP states) have put him in jail. 

Every hindu godmen/guru doesn't by default become a BJP men. Two such people who have been in news recently, Shankracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati and Asaram are closer to congress than to BJP.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Sharing concern over drought in various parts of the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today pitched for water conservation through a mass movement as he pinned hopes on the Monsoon which is predicted to bring upto 110 per cent of rainfall this season.In his monthly radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat', he also talked about efforts to clean Ganga and Yamuna rivers, hoping that these will show results in some time.Among other several issues, he delved on education, emphasising that the focus should now shift from enrolment to providing quality education.During his 30-minute broadcast, Modi also expressed gratitude to one crore households which gave up LPG subsidy in response to his call and exhorted media to highlight positive news.Talking about the drought situation in various parts of the country, he said concern over it is natural, particularly since prolonged drought leads to drop in water table in reservoirs.

&gt;* ""To fight the drought and water scarcity, the governments will do their work.

&gt;* In several villages, an awareness has been seen with regard to the value of water and in such places, there is sensitivity and a will to do something to conserve,"" he said.He referred to the weather forecast which has predicted that the country will receive 106 per cent to 110 per cent rainfall during this Monsoon and said such good news always brings peace.

&gt;* ""But this news brings new awareness also...While the news about good rainfall brings comfort, it also provides an opportunity and a challenge.

&gt;* So even though we have a water crisis now, we have one and a half month to prepare (before the onset of Monsoon),"" he said.

184,"&gt;There have been no major communal riots in the past two years but every small incident has been blown up in the media into a huge atrocity.

Seriously, if the Muslim families were not so keen on eating beef or keeping meat in their refrigerator, they wouldn't have got into any trouble at all. Wonder why they didn't have such wisdom not to provoke true Indian Hindus by eating beef or meat. Its about time they turn to vegetarian meals, which would help them grow taller, stronger and healthier.

&gt;Two or three churches were attacked within months of Modi becoming Prime Minister, and we made it sound as if there was a general attack on the Christian faith. This made international headlines.

Seriously, just a few churches, two or three or four or five, ok just  a handful were attacked and those proselytising Christians start crying foul. If they don't proselytise, nobody would have harmed them. Just why can't they chant 'Shri Ram Ki jai', the pastor would not have been assaulted or his pregnant wife doused in petrol. Wonder why they have such closed minds not to be patriotic.

&gt;Then came the murders of three rationalists, and this was made so big an issue that academics in fine American universities announced that dissent was being crushed in India.

Seriously, again 3 or 4 or 5, ok just a handful of rationalists killed. We don't have any dearth of such rationalists in our Country, surely. Anyone can easily replace them, its not like they gave any insightful ideas anyways - only talking about caste and communalism or eating beef, or exposing sham rituals, miracles, black magic, and godmen - seriously what's the need? who asked you?, Now they have gone India feels like a breath of fresh air - no pollution from such so-called 'rationalists'

&gt;Then came the horrible murder of Mohammad Akhlaq, and this caused ‘secular’ writers to return literary awards on the grounds that secularism was being destroyed.

Seriously, wonder what the fuss is all about here. Why don't you return awards when Congress is in power? Yeah there was a communal incident but is it important? Look at the larger scheme of things - this secular garb is getting old. Hiding behind 'secular'  and returning awards is clearly the bigger issue here than a communal murder. Good that Anupam Kher toook out a procession to show who exactly is in the wrong.

Holding Modi responsible for 2002 is immature, after the courts have given him a clean chit! It was vested interests in Gujarat who are responsible for the riots and murder of Muslims en masse. He was the CM of Gujarat - there's only so much a CM can do. If the whole Police top brass acted in a collective manner in cohorts with those fringe elements in RSS or BJP or VHP or Bajrang Dal or whatever, it is beyond the CM's power to stop it. Modi has said ""I feel sad about what happened but no guilt. And no court has come even close to establishing it. It was not up to me. And I was not ready to go against party discipline; I don't want to fight against my party. What my leaders say, I must follow it.""

&gt;* It has suggested roping in the Information and Broadcasting Ministry for execution.The GoM has suggested producing a film every two weeks to highlight the government's achievements which will be played out before every film in every theatre ""mandatorily"", for which again it has recommended taking I and B Ministry's help.Against the backdrop of allegations that state governments often take the credit for central schemes, the GoM has recommended that the inauguration of central schemes should be done in presence of Union ministers and lawmakers so the role of Centre is highlighted.It has also recommended enhancing the authority of lawmakers by giving them constitutional authority to carry out checks on execution of the schemes and build in a system of penalties enforceable by central government whenever there is lack of efficiency in execution of a scheme.If the recommendations are implemented, the monitoring committees in districts for the schemes will be headed by lawmakers.Currently these are headed by District Magistrates or Superintendents of Police.As per the note, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry is amending the rules to allow lawmakers to head the committees.Keen to augment its presence in the media, the GoM has recommended that every minister should give a minimum of two interviews every week to the National Broadcasters-- Doordarshan and All India Radio--, besides a particular news agency.

Wait. I thought India was a democracy with freedom of expression. Where does the question of Modi or the government not tolerating adverse comments arise?

204,"I was enjoying your sarcasm, but you lost your credibility when you wrote this:

&gt;Modi has said ""I feel sad about what happened but no guilt. And no court has come even close to establishing it. It was not up to me. And I was not ready to go against party discipline; I don't want to fight against my party. What my leaders say, I must follow it.""

[There is a pretty important wall of text that is missing](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/I-am-sad-about-Gujarat-riots-but-have-no-guilt-Narendra-Modi-in-biography/articleshow/32675740.cms) between ""establishing it"" and ""it was not up to me"".

He said this on the context of resignation, and your BS quote should have indicated that there was stuff said in-between, which I've linked to above and will reproduce in verbatim for you below.

&gt;The 310-page book deals with the riots in some detail with ""hitherto unpublished, authenticated documents"". It discloses that after the riots Modi wanted to resign as chief minister but was prevailed upon by the party to continue.

&gt;Marino says that the BJP strongman had confided in him ""possibly for the first time in an on-the-record interview, that he no longer wanted to be the chief minister after the riots because he had decided it was unfair on the people of the state who had been subjected to extreme abuse because of him"".

&gt;Narendra Modi had resolved to step down at the BJP National Executive in Panaji on April 12, 2002, about a month after the post-Godhra riots.

&gt;The largely-adulatory book quotes Modi as having told the Panaji conclave, ""I want to speak on Gujarat. From the party's point of view this is a grave issue.

&gt;""There is a need for a free and frank discussion. To enable this, I wish to place my resignation before this body. It is time we decided what direction the party and the country should take from this point onwards.""

&gt;The chief minister told the biographer, ""I wanted to leave this position but my party was not ready to leave me, the people of Gujarat were not ready to leave me, this situation is what I had (to deal with).

Don't quote selectively. Always make the context clear. Don't be that guy, don't be a chutiya.",2016-04-24 21:15:41
205,"&gt; The GoM has suggested producing a film every two weeks to highlight the government's achievements which will be played out before every film in every theatre ""mandatorily"", for which again it has recommended taking I and B Ministry's help.  

States should also do this. For eg. In Delhi, cinemas should show one Kejri film followed by one Modi film and then actual film after interval.",2016-04-24 21:18:19
206,"&gt;This makes those supporters a revenge decision &gt;maker rather than being a wise and objective &gt;decision maker.



An objective decision maker  will know how to read between the lines, how to clear off the signal from the noise, forcing people to believe that they did wrong thing by voting Modi won't work anymore.

The more media labels the 31% dumb, the more it will backfire.

That's How things work now .

Remember Bharkha dutt commet in 2007, traditionally ""backword""?

Remember how the whole media covered the 2007 elections ?

And how every exit pool showed Modi and BJP loosing?

Remember Sonia Ji saying "" maut ka saudagar""?

Or Congress saying "" we will book Modi if we win 2007 Gujarat elections "".

Things backfire dude.

Peolle are observing, the Non Modi voters of 2014 are the same who are disproportionatly loud after 2014 as well.
The Modi Voters are silent, that does not mean they are not observing.

2. Actual statistics showed no special rise in incidents of crime on Churches in 2014 compared to that on other places of worship. There was also no correlation to the BJP/RSS for the 'attacks' which were mainly petty crimes. The whole *'Attack on Churches due to Modi government'* conclusion was drawn from nowhere. The most telling thing is that immediately after the Delhi elections they stopped talking about it.

3. I am glad to know you care so much about the death of those rationalists but till date there has not been even an iota of evidence that they were killed by the BJP/RSS/Baba Ramdev/Zionists/CIA or whomsoever has been blamed by the media and liberal class. Before even any investigation judgements were passed from armchairs and awards returned.

4. Each and every one of the Award Wapasi guys was a left-leaning intellectual or filmmaker most of which had also campaigned against Modi or the BJP in past elections. The fact that they claimed India had become a fascist state and was in dire straits but suddenly shut up after the Bihar election results were announced(as if overnight the fascist problem had vanished) tells us everything about how genuine their concern was.

1. Some routine exercise of clearing old Parliament files sparked rumours of how files related to RSS role in Gandhi's assassination had been destroyed. The 'secular' parties even used it to stall Parliament.

2. Some journalist named Vaidik visited Pakistan on some unofficial diplomatic mission with Mani Shankar Aiyar and Salman Khurshid. He met with Hafiz Saeed and suddenly the media started alleging that Modi government was using Vaidik to negotiate with terrorists based on the logic of guilt-by-association because he was an associate of Baba Ramdev.

3. The usual exaggerated controversies over 'saffronization' of textbooks. That was before the actual Vedic science stuff; back then they only had *rumours* that so-and-so changes would be made.

4. Some Muslim techie was killed in Pune by some unknown Hindu-something-sena group and Modi's election was directly blamed for it and the whole media was pressuring him to personally speak out as if BJP was responsible for the murder.

5. When lawyer Uday U Lalit was nominated to the Supreme Court by the Collegium the media immediately pointed out that he had defended Amit Shah in the fake encounter cases and made connections while omitting the fact that Lalit's name had been in the running since before the 2014 elections and he had a record of integrity and had served as prosecutor for the 2G scam case.

6. And of course there's the infamous 'Attack on Churches' hysteria. The media created a narrative of BJP/RSS/Hindutva elements vandalising churches out of nowhere in the run-up to the Delhi elections in order to polarize minority votes in AAP's favour.

Whereas the UPA had the media on its side for pretty much their entire first term and half their second term. Not surprising considering the favours they bestowed on journalists as we now know from Radiagate.

No, nobody in the media ever accused Congress of being too secular. In fact in the UPA-1 era they were all too willing to jump on board the 'secular' bandwagon when it came to 'saffron terror', the 2002 riots cases, Maut ka Saudagar, Ishrat Jehan the innocent girl etc.

And who are these 'true culprits'? Culprits for what? I know that some people regard defeating Modi as the ultimate cause and will never balk at lies or deceit for it, but as was the case then and is the case now nobody has ever substatiated the allegation of *'rising Church attacks under Modi and because of RSS'.* Repeating an allegation 10,000 times does not make it true when all facts and statistics go against it.

&gt;And yet the very same BJP apologists are so fast in delivering their verdicts on Dadri, church attacks etc even before any so called 'judgements' are out!

&gt;* The 1964 Act said that anyone violating the law can be punished with imprisonment up to maximum of 6 months or fine of up to Rs.

-The relentless protests all suddenly happening during the 2015 Bihar election season and suddenly winding down soon after the results were announced

-Towards the end some of the intolerance brigade members even admitting their political leanings by endorsing Nitish Kumar and/or Rahul Gandhi and admitting their main concern was the BJP winning

The Congress has been in power the longest so most of the filmmaking and intellectual establishment lean towards it. The BJP also has a few like SL Bhyarappa and Anupam Kher types but not many.

This is hardly a new thing. During the 2014 elections scores of filmmakers and activists spoke out against Narendra Modi and signed a petition telling people that corruption(main reason for UPA's fall) was an important issue but *'India's secular values are not negotiable'* and so they should *'vote for the secular party most likely to win'*.

http://zeenews.india.com/news/general-elections-2014/bollywood-celebs-appeal-for-secular-consolidation-against-narendra-modi_924940.html

Undoubtedly, corruption and governance are important issues, but we will have to vigilantly work out ways of holding our government accountable to that. However, one thing is clear: India`s secular character is not negotiable! Not now, not ever.”*

&gt;""As Indian citizens who love our motherland, we appeal to you to vote for the secular party, which is most likely to win in your constituency,"" they said.

The award wapasi and 'intolerance' protests for the Bihar elections were just a continuation of this on a larger scale. These rent seekers are called whenever Congress is in trouble during an election.

And btw proof: The intolerance brigade admitting 'success' after UPA won the Bihar elections. Apparently India suddenly became tolerant again just by that.

&gt; * The removal of Aamir Khan as brand ambassador of Incredible India and the appointment of Salman Khan as India's brand ambassador for the Rio Olympics shows to us the transparency with which the Modi government acts and reacts.Aamir Khan has been a successful film actor, producer and director.

&gt; * When Shahrukh Khan expressed his opinion on extreme intolerance in India to Barkha Dutt, Salman came to the valiant rescue of Bharat Mata and declared India is a tolerant country - ""my mother is Susheela Charak and my father is Salim Khan,"" he said.

&gt; * Those affected by Vishwa Hindu Parishad's Love Jihad campaign in the cow-dung belt of India can go climb a peepal tree.For an establishment out to loudly distinguish between a good Khan and a bad Khan, who else is better suited to be the brand ambassador of India at the Rio Olympics than Salman?Before we get depressed, more and more people are demanding accountability.

&gt; * The Modi government has perhaps appointed him as India's brand ambassador to unleash ""the killer instinct"" in our sportsmen and women.On a more serious note, why does this government end up making such dubious appointments?

&gt;* Lashing out at the policies of the Centre, he said that ""every day we are facing problems...Pakistan is not giving up its design...China is showing us its might by intrusion... is keen to stop Brahmaputra rivers water and wants to take control over Arunachal Pardesh.""

&gt;* Modi also referred to his association with Jat leaders Devilal and Bansi Lal, while referrring to his links with Haryana and recalled that he had addressed his last rally in Rewari with Vajpayee.

Our honourable [Prime Minister enlightened](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141109/commentary-columnists/article/when-modi-channels-dinanath-batra) us about how plastic surgery, stem cell technology, pushpak vimaan etc were pretty vogue in ancient India. 

But one serious challenge though: only about [14,000 Indians claim Sanskrit is their mother tongue](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/where-are-the-sanskrit-speakers/article6299433.ece). We can subject all those who genuinely value our ancient values to stop all of their activities and learn the language first. Not an easy job; it is not just enough to learn the greatest language of all times but they should also be able to understand the scientific concepts written in those texts. It also requires scientific temper, a rare commodity these days unlike those ancient ages.

I personally would prioritize Pushpak Vimaan. It would be a great boon for all of us, especially for those living in Delhi since pushpak vimaans would go beyond the purview of the odd-even rule. Since fossil fuels were still buried in the ground during those glory days, were pushpaj vimaans possibly using Solar energy? It would be music to the ears not only to the environmentalists but also to those who think, as George Carlin put it, ""the planet is not fucked, we are!""

It remains to be seen if pushpak vimaans will prove be economically viable or not. Would it be cheaper to travel between cities than simply taking a flight? Or easier to maintain than a car? Would it be easy enough to park our vimaans in the congested streets? If not, at least the automobile and aviation industry have nothing to worry about and also no fear of job loss for the workers in those industry.

Another big thing about pushpak vimaans is that they have this ""autonomous driving"" feature. Imagine if we come out with pushpak vimaans before any of the top-two corporations in the world, Google or Apple, can bring out their self-driving cars to the market! It would do wonders to the image of our country.

It has also suggested that films highlighting the achievements of the Modi dispensation should be produced every fortnight and shown “mandatorily” before screening of movies in theatres.

LOL. Like why the fuck would Modi give a shit about ""loss"" in Delhi, where they haven't been in power for what, 15 years ? Not to mention the fact that there is possibly no political office at the state level as useless Delhi government.

&gt; Let's also not forget the files taken by investigation agencies which apparently implicated jaitley in DGCA scams

If they implicated Jaitley in DGCA scams, Kejriwal would have filed a case against Jaitley. And even Kejru Bhagwan himself only claims that ""they read the files"":

There is literally zero benefit to reading files, since in an actual legal case you have to submit documents during the discovery process. so, if there ever was a case against Jaitley he would be provided the files anyway. Not to mention, Kejru can release the contents of these files to the public if he wants to.

________________________
________________________  
India is growing faster than any other economy in the world.
Not long ago, India was the laggard among the big emerging economies.

In 2013 Jim O'Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who coined the BRIC acronym, demanded of India: ""What is the matter with you guys?"".

In 2016 India is likely to hold its position at the top of the table.

While China began January with a bout of confidence-sapping market turmoil, India is expected to grow at the same rate as last year-or possibly faster.

The question is whether India's resurgence can be sustained into the future, and the answer will matter not just for the prospects of India's 1.3 billion people, but also for the balance of power in Asia and beyond.

Some global companies seem bullish: General Motors and Foxconn have announced major investment drives in India; Apple recently announced plans to open its first retail outlet in the country.

Consumer-price inflation has tumbled from an average of over 9 percent in 2011-2013 to less than 6 percent in 2014-2015: presumably cheap commodity prices explain much of this progress? Actually, oil has very little weight in India's consumer-price index, which is dominated by food and services.

Some of the reduction in the central government's budget deficit, which has fallen from 4.6 percent of GDP in the last fiscal year before Modi took office to about 4 percent now, reflects an automatic windfall from the oil price, which cut the cost of fuel subsidies.

If the government gets less credit than it deserves from India's skeptical political classes, why might this be? Part of the answer lies in politics: the Hindu nationalism of Modi's support base is understandably unpopular with India's cosmopolitan elite.

The prime minister took office in May 2014 as a reformer, promising to cut the red tape and corruption that hold India back.

In the absence of solid achievements, he has rolled out a series of cheap slogans-""Digital India,"" ""Skill India,"" ""Make in India,"" and so on.

To invert the skeptics' argument, the fact that India is growing fast despite its banking problems only goes to show how it could accelerate as those problems are addressed.

At some point in the future, bank lending will pick up again, both because banks' balance sheets will strengthen and because companies' demand for capital will intensify-recently, part of the cause of weak lending has been weak demand for capital, as companies have reckoned with a glut of manufacturing capacity, both in India and worldwide.

Add in the fact that foreign portfolio investors withdrew money from India last year, and you have to ask the question: if India can grow at over 7 percent without financial exuberance, what might happen when the financial cycle turns?

The bottom line is that India's potential is enormous.

&gt; * The BJP support base, the source said, is among Punjabi Hindu voters and given the shadow of the Akali Dal, the party lacks an assertive identity.

&gt; * Thakur delivered an impassioned and emotional appeal, directed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that Indias apex court was woefully under-equipped to adequately address the number of cases it had pending.

&gt; * While Thakur primarily spoke for his court, the Supreme Court, the broader problem of an overburdened judiciary extends across Indias national court system.

&gt; * In 2008, the Indian Justice Ministry, acting on a recommendation originally made by the Law Commission in 1987,said it would aim to have 50 judges per million people by 2013, a target it failed to reach.

&gt; * Moreover, the judiciary, like the rest of Indias central and state bureaucracies, isnt immune from the negative effects of corruption.

---

&gt;* In a presentation made to Modi last week, the policy agency said that India can become a $10 trillion economy by 2032 if it increases its growth rate from 7% to 10% annually, starting this year.

&gt;* India has consistently fared poorly in the Doing Business Indexwhich ranks countries on the ease of starting and running businessesand the Modi administration had made it a priority to reduce bottlenecks.

&gt;* In a country where thousands of farmers commit suicide annually due to crop loss and financial burden, the governments road map to the $10 trillion economy proposes the use of advanced technology, setting up an irrigation fund, and the use of high-yield seeds.

&gt;* Niti Aayog has suggested that the countrys public sector companies adopt railway stations, schools, bus stands, hospitals, religious, heritage sites for cleanliness to ensure efficiency.

&gt;* The roadmap lists tougher emission norms for vehicles, incentivizing the construction of energy efficient buildings, and setting up 15 new coal washers to reduce ash content.

&gt;* It is known to everybody that more than half of legislators and ministers in the ruling Grand Alliance are habitual boozers, which puts a question mark on Nitish Kumar governments commitment to fully enforce prohibition in Bihar, he alleged.

&gt; * ""We cancelled the deal immediately after reports suggested that there was something wrong, blacklisted the company and initiated a legal battle against it,"" Sharma said.The Congress leader said despite the fact that AgustaWestland was blacklisted and banned by the previous Congress-led government, the Narendra Modi government removed its name from the blacklist and invited it for its 'Make in India' programme.Giving details, Sharma said the whole business of buying helicopters for the Indian Air Force from AgustaWestland was started during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's rule when a technical evaluation committee shortlisted the firm's helicopter.

&gt; * ""No government in the world took action (in a case with such promptness) as we did,"" he said, adding that it was the Congress' turn to ask questions in the case as to how the Modi government removed the firm from the blacklist.Sharma said the UPA government, after cancelling the deal with AgustaWestland, took it to court and directed the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate to investigate the matter.The BJP, earlier in the day, asked Antony to clarify if any Congress leader was involved in accepting bribe in the $750 million AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal.Bribery allegations in the deal for the 12 AW-101 choppers were being probed by the CBI.

The source newspaper states, ""This newspaper could not independently verify Michel's allegations."" 

So if you think a fugitive (who may do and say anything to save himself) is a credible source of information please keep on living in your imaginary world. However, lets even say that Michel is correct, and that GOI is seeking evidence; that does not give a clean chit to the people who are involved.

Regarding the schedule for the parliament, the point I was making is that in a normal year the parliament is in session for the entire year except for 3-4 months. So for any news story (positive or negative) it has high probability to coincide with parliament being in session. 

So in order for wild theories such as the one you pointed out to make sense:

1. GOI and Italy have to collude to bring down a powerful one of the most powerful Italian outside of Italy; Sonia 

2. The executive branch of Italy has to have direct control over the  presiding judge in the matter. Same with GOI and the judge presiding over the Italian Marines case.

3. All of the parties (GOI, Indian judiciary, Italian Executive branch, Italian judiciary) mentioned above must coordinate to the timing of the release with the starting of the session in the Indian Parliament.

1. Put pressure on US to go easy on Indian companies that benefit largely from H1B = business lobby happy

2. Cajole US to go easy on the Patel visa rejections = Patidar agitation quelled (?)

3. Get US to remove the WTO blockade of India's solar power program (already happening in pieces) = we made India free from conventional energy source

4. Finally have a counterpart in US who thinks like a bijnessman = rubs hands in glee

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on May 1 launch an ambitious Rs 8,000 crore scheme to provide 5 crore free LPG connections to BPL families using the money saved from 1.13 crore cooking gas users voluntarily giving up their subsidies.Modi will launch the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana at Ballia in Uttar Pradesh on May 1 and do a repeat function at Dahod in Gujarat on May 15.Though 'Give-it-Up' campaign seeking the well-heeled to voluntarily surrender cooking gas subsidies for one year was launched in January, 2015, Modi on March 27 last year officially launched the programme.

&gt;* ""Five states of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu account for roughly half of the people who have given up LPG subsidies,"" Pradhan said.Consumers are currently entitled to 12 cylinders of 14.2 kg each or 34 bottles of 5 kg each in a year at subsidised rates.

&gt;* The identification of eligible BPL families will be made in consultation with the State Governments and the Union Territories, he said.Pradhan said the country currently has 16.64 crore active LPG consumers.Of the 21 million tonne LPG requirement, nearly 40 per cent is imported and this will go up as demand rises by double digit with new connections.

&gt;* The aim is also to bring down the country's dependence on energy imports by 10 per cent by 2022.LPG subsidy is transfered to beneficiaries directly in their bank accounts in advance.Consumers can opt out of the subsidy by submitting written request to the distributor or electronically at mylpg.in.Pradhan said with LPG coverage being predominantly in the urban and semi-urban areas, there are serious health hazards associated with cooking based on fossil fuels.According to WHO estimates, about 5 lakh deaths in India alone due to unclean cooking fuels.

&gt;* ""Providing LPG connections to BPL households will ensure universal coverage of cooking gas in the country.

---

&gt;* ""The Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year was a huge success in Rajasthan, which became the first state in north India and number three in the country to have distributed more than 1 crore bulbs.

&gt;* We want to replicate the same success in the energy efficient fan programme also,"" said Ritu Singh, project manager, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), Rajasthan.Under NEEFP Scheme, EESL aims to provide high quality 5-star rated fans to domestic consumers at a concessional rate.

&gt;* These fans are going to be distributed at a price of Rs 1200-1300 per unit, whereas the same is available in the market at a higher price of Rs 1600-1900.As per EESL's calculation, these 5-star rated fans are expected to help save Rs 720 annually from the electricity bill and if a consumer invests Rs 1200-1300, he will be able to recover the complete cost in around two years.Even though the PAYS (pay as you save) model has been developed for faster adoption which helps the customer recover the cost limited to the annual savings while the balance is paid by the discoms, Singh said initially the fans will be available at an upfront cost in Rajasthan.Fans are a primary source of cooling as the penetration of ACs still remains below 10%.

&gt;* In most of the households, EESL estimates, ceiling fans run for at least 9-10 hours a day.

&gt;* Apart from the energy savings benefits that this scheme has brought to the consumers, it has also helped the state government to create almost 7000 additional jobs across centres in 33 districts.

Google says HLL revenue was 300 B INR while PA revenue was 55 B INR.  In other words, PA is just a sixth of HLL!  And it was not a blip on the radar even couple of years ago.  This kind of growth rates would make even Robert Vadra proud!

[And then, while their own website proudly proclaims their balance sheet and sales figures, it curiously stops providing any such numbers post-2013!](http://www.patanjaliayurved.org/about.html)  That coincides precisely with their ascendancy and perhaps the untold billions they've laundered in the run-up to the general elections. For a company that supposedly was founded in 2006, it's supposed meteoric rise, coincides with BJP/Modi/Shah's meteoric rise?    

now that their handlers are in power, the whitewashing is on full-throttle.  Lest we forget, there is an article in print or audio or video any which way you turn that proclaims the same screed.  over and over and over again.  we're told and urged to believe that PA is the new kid on the block and HLL and the likes are quaking in their boots.  

This does two things - one, it seeks to legitimize their image in the eyes of a sceptical public and two - it works as a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Because there is so much buzz and any publicity is good publicity, it helps with branding, image and consequently sales.  somewhat like a Rajnikanth movie -- the worse the movie, the bigger the flop, the greater the hype.  or any bollywood movie - where anecdotally, I can tell you from many I know, people go to watch a movie after the newspapers start blaring after the first weekend that the movie ""minted"" 200 crores in the ""opening weekend"".  

None of those paid-for articles in paid-for media goes into any detail.  they wave around a number - whether it is sales of Patanjali chyavanprash or the BO collections of the latest blockbuster - and that is it.  no support.  no evidence. no documentation.  no opinions of experts. no audited balance sheets.  no critical analysis.  no nothing.  and yet, the faithful like you expect *me* to disprove *your* fantastic claim(s)? ...not how the world works.

let me leave you with some wisdom for the ages.  wisdom that has stood the test of time across cultures, across time and space.  it goes something like this.  if something looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck.. it's probably a duck.  because, if something is too good to be true, it probably is not true.

Indeed. And AAP started falling apart(Bhushan and Yadav's rebellion, Kejriwal kicking every founder besides himself out of the party, the stings on 'political realignment' ie horse-trading of Congress MLAs etc) and dumped their clean politics agenda in the trash after that.

Why [AVBP swept the DUSU polls](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l1dy1/dusu_elections_scale_may_be_low_but_make_no/) despite Kejriwal himself campaigning. Why students, government employees, auto and taxi unions, the middle class, and other groups that once supported AAP have started being disgruntled against his government. Why a recent poll said AAP would still win if fresh elections were held in Delhi but by a much smaller margin than 67-3.

The people have spoken. They're not dumb and they can see in the long run when someone has fooled them in the name of change and revolution.

Modi, someone without any major influence at that time, was made a interim CM to be disposed off later when situation has quieted down a bit. But then Godhra happened and consequently riot broke out. As I had said state administration was deeply compromised and no one had any control for a few days. It was only after the riot that Modi realized how compromised the whole system was. He cracked down on Bajrang Dal, VHP, hard and greatly diminished their influence on administration. Several Hindutva org leaders and members were arrested like Babu Bajrangi. EDIT: It wasn't even VHP/Bajrang Dal vs Muslims. There were lots of Congress leaders and workers involved in the riots but no one mentions this fact. 

Now, since 2002, has any major incident like riots happened in Gujarat? No. 

Why do you think there is such deep animosity between Modi and VHP? Modi didn't shield them from justice. In fact, 2002 riots has the highest conviction rates of any riots including major ones. 

What have you got to say about all these things. 

&gt;Seems like Vajpayee was kind of afraid of Modi, to be honest.

That's just you seeing what you want to see. Vajpayee wasn't afraid of someone like Modi. What could Modi, an un-influencial fellow, have done to him, a veteran? Nothing.

I still suggest you read several books on the issue over tidbits in rags.",2016-04-28 11:22:46
433,"'Modi Offered To Free Italian Marine In Exchange Of Proof Against Sonia'

---

&gt;* British arms agent, Christian Michel, wanted by Indian investigators in helicopter scam has apparently accused the Narendra Modi government of offering Italy the freedom of two marines in exchange of information against Sonia Gandhi and her her family.

&gt;* According to the Telegraph, Michel has made these claims in a letter to the International Tribunal of the Law of the Seas in Hamburg and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague where Italy and India are battling legally over murder charges against the marines.

&gt;* Michel has claimed Modi made the offer at a secret ""brush-by"" meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi during the UN General Assembly in September 2015 when both leaders were in New York.

&gt;* The Italian marines are accused of shooting two Kerala fishermen dead in February 2012 and the charges against them have had much impact on Italy and India's diplomatic relationship.

&gt;* While one of the marines has been allowed by the Indian Supreme Court to stay in Italy over health issues, the other one remains in India.

Google old articles from 2010 onwards. Patanjali's been around for over a decade and started making it big about 5 years ago when the beloved UPA was in power. For the past several years their growth has been in double digit percentage. Their main factory is in Uttarakhand which is ruled by the Congress. There are even case studies on it by reputed research firms.

They are getting media attention only now because they've started investing in advertising to compete with Unilever and because of Ramdev's support for Modi since 2014.

&gt; * Thirteen thematic circuits, including the Ramayana, Krishna, Buddhist and coastal circuits, are being accorded top priority by the government and are already under development.The group proposed that homestays not be charged service tax or commercial levies and that their licensing process be made online.

&gt; * ""It is proposed that homestays should be exempt from service tax, and various levies like electricity and water charges, and property tax should not be on commercial rates, and the process of certifying these homestays should be hassle-free and online, backed by third-party inspections,"" Zutshi said.The ministry is urging state governments to modify their guidelines accordingly, Zutshi said.

&gt;* Employment generation in eight key sectors has slowed down to a seven-year low in 2015, labour bureau data released recently showed.

&gt;* Worse, during October to December last year, 20,000 people lost jobs in these sectors, partly because of shrinking exports.

&gt;* But will Make in India be able to spin jobs in large numbers given the increasingly automated and robotised manufacturing solutions?

Do you not think that the same thing happened with Urdu as well? [Here](http://tribune.com.pk/story/235805/how-urdu-got-associated-with-muslims-in-india--i/) is a link which shows that purification of Urdu started way before than the period you mention. 

&gt; There may even be a day when Hindi and Urdu have diverged enough to no longer be considered the same language.

You can say the same thing about *Tamil* and *Malayalam*.

And by the way the fight was more about the __*written script*__ as well. How decipherable is __*Nastaliq*__ to you? or to most Indians? There was a lineage of scripts like __*Sharada*__ and __*Nagari*__ (and children scripts like __*Devnagari*__, __*Kaithi*__, __*Modi*__. Even scripts like __*Tibetian*__ are decipherable if you put a little effort) which were more widely used and yet all of them were ignored in favour of __*Nastaliq*__.
