&gt; * ""We will see radical issues being taken up by this committee in the days to come,"" a senior government official told ET.The bullet train agreement signed by Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on December 12 was the first project taken up by the innovation committee after it was formed in October.

&gt; * ""Japan has the largest operating system, a safety record with no fatality since 1964 in their high-speed rail network and they agreed to give us a highly concessional loan on easy terms,"" said another senior government official involved in preparing the assessment report of the bullet train project for the empowered committee.The committee will meet at least once every 15 days and advise government departments and agencies and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board on converting concepts into implementable projects.

So giving vague details now will protect that person in the future. That way I can claim that I am that un-named official and now I am being harassed by Modi??? Would it not make more sense to rather get him to record a statement in the presence of a magistrate now, before giving out any details?

&gt; Then the Delhi govt can appeal for stay or can claim that the individual is intentionally being harassed.

Based on what? A vague statement in the assembly? Yes they can claim a lot of things, but for a court of law to accept anything - it has to be in accordance to the law.

What official record are we talking about? Saying something in the assembly does not make it acceptable in any court of law.

&gt; * There are also restrictions on donations by companies that are registered in India but majority-held by foreigners.The amendment being brought into the Act seeks to allow foreign companies that are registered in India to contribute to political parties from their corporate social responsibility fund in sectors where FDI is allowed, an official familiar with the matter said.When contacted, a home ministry spokesperson said he would ""not like to comment as of now"".In November, the government eased FDI restrictions in 15 sectors, including retail, construction, banking, defence and broadcasting.The FCRA rules are being changed to get corporate funding since under the Companies Act, Indian companies are required to spend 2 per cent of their profits on CSR , sources told ET.

&gt; * This will benefit the BJP and Congress, which are under scrutiny for receiving foreign contribution from UK-headquartered Vedanta Industries.On a PIL filed by the Association of Democratic Rights, the Delhi high court had in May 2014 directed the government and Election Commission to take action against the BJP and Congress.

&gt;People forget that this party is not like Congress or other secular parties including AAP where no one can criticise the high command.

&gt;Why Kirti Azad? Who afterall criticised DDCA and never said anything about Jaitley in person. Look at Shatrughan Sinha who openly criticises Modi and Amit Shah for Bihar. Or Advani and Marg Darshak Mandal. There are enough BJP leaders who have openly criticised Modi himself but are all in the party.

&gt;This is not like the stooges and sycophants party like Congress where no one can say a word against Sonia or Rahul. Or for that matter a SP where no one can say anything about Mulayam or Akhilesh. Or JD(U) where no one can go against Nitish. Or TMC or BSP or AIADMK.

&gt;Or even AAP where a Prashant Bhushan or Yogendra Yadav will be booted out if they say a word against Kerji.

&gt;BJP is the only truly democratic party where followers can criticise leaders and still be in the party and any follower can become a leader. Like Modi.

&gt; * So, our connections run deep and long.At a personal level, my first international agreement as Chief Minister of Gujarat was with Astrakhan.Since India's Independence in 1947, India and Russia have formed a genuinely close strategic partnership, characterized by unmatched mutual trust and confidence, and solidarity with each other.

&gt; * Russian assistance has helped India's industrialization and progress in many areas, including space.Russia provided defence equipment to India and international support when few were willing to hold our hands.

&gt; * We work together in a number of international forums, including BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (where Russian support helped in a decision on India's full membership this year), G 20 and East Asia Summit.BRICS, which was launched by President Putin, is making a major contribution to international finance and trade, development finance, international terrorism, climate change, food security and sustainable development.

&gt;* At the same time, he said he has evidence of the corruption, which he would use if he found himself ""back to the wall"".The lawmaker, who earlier in the evening warned that he would ""show them,"" said he was not interested in ""big talk"" or ""blackmail"" and would not use the evidence till he was forced, since ""it would damage a lot of people personally"".Denying that he had indulged in any anti-party activities, he said he wants the Prime Minister to intervene, since ""the PM is the biggest crusader against corruption"".

&gt;* The Prime Minister is currently on a visit to Russia This evening, the BJP suspended the lawmaker, days after he flouted party chief Amit Shah and publicly targeted Union finance minister Arun Jaitley with allegations of corruption in Delhi's cricket body.Mr Azad had not named Mr Jaitley in his allegations and the suspension order accused him of ""colluding"" with opposition parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress, with the purpose of embarrassing the party and its office bearers.Reiterating that the issue was old, Mr Azad denied that he had teamed up with the Congress or the AAP.The BJP, he told NDTV, must prove what anti-party activities he has committed.

&gt;* Mr Sinha, urged the BJP to not take action against Mr Azad, who has alleged corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association or DDCA when Mr Jaitley headed it.

&gt;* Hours before Kirti Azad was suspended by the BJP, another party rebel, Shatrughan Sinha, described him as a ""hero"" for taking on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over alleged corruption in Delhi's cricket body.Mr Sinha tweeted support for Mr Azad, who defied the party leadership by publicly attacking Mr Jaitley, all but naming him while alleging deep corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association or DDCA, which Mr Jaitley headed for 13 years.In a series of tweets, Shatrughan Sinha said,

&gt;* Feel that untimely action could boomerang.

&gt;* On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended Arun Jaitley at a weekly meeting of party lawmakers, saying he would come out ""with flying colours"" in the Delhi cricket body controversy, much like BJP veteran LK Advani had emerged unscathed from Hawala charges in the 1990s.Mr Advani had resigned as a member of parliament and refused to contest elections till he was cleared of the charges.Both Shatrughan Sinha and Kirti Azad are BJP lawmakers from Bihar, where the party suffered a humiliating defeat in assembly elections last month.

&gt;* Mr Sinha, sulking from being sidelined in the state, had in a flurry of tweets messaged an elaborate ""I told you so"" to the party leadership and then promptly visited Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav, who defeated the BJP, to congratulate them.There has been buzz for some time that the BJP will take disciplinary action against Mr Sinha for his frequent rebellion and refusal to toe the party line, but that is yet to happen.Arun Jaitley has sued leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party, including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, over their allegations against him of corruption in the DDCA, but he has not taken Kirti Azad to court.

&gt; * Except this time there was one difference: It was a bureaucrat close to Kejriwal with an office in the same premises as the chief minister's office.Kejriwal's response has been to call Prime Minister Narendra Modi a ""psychopath"", claim the raid was part of a political vendetta and attempt to shift the conversation on to other allegations altogether.On Tuesday, Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party convened a Special Session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly a house where 67 out of 70 members come from AAP to talk about the events of the past few weeks.

&gt; * The Congress government that ran Delhi for 15 years before it was dethroned by AAP was, in its later years, also plagued by corruption allegations  not just regarding politicians like Kalmadi, but bureaucrats as well.Among those bureaucrats was one Rajendra Kumar.

&gt; * He also happens to have been hand-picked by Kejriwal to be Delhi's principal secretary, and the reason the CBI was raiding his office.If Kalmadi and Jaitley were worth making snide remarks over and it's useful to remember that Kalmadi has not yet been convicted and Jaitley hasn't even been formally charged then members of AAP, a party built on an anti-corruption platform, should be the last ones defending someone like Kumar.

&gt; * ""The Prime Minister cannot forget the defeat the BJP was dealt with by AAP in Delhi,"" Kejriwal said at the end of the Special Session he had convened to talk about the DDCA allegations.

&gt;* He said he had never targeted finance minister Arun Jaitley, who for years headed the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), although much of the wrongdoing took place during his tenure.

&gt;* Questioning his suspension, Azad said the party did not follow the due process and also did not serve a show cause notice before taking such an action against a Member of Parliament.

&gt;* Azad had defied party chief Amit Shahs whip and held a press conference on Sunday and alleged massive corruption in the affairs of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).

&gt;* On Tuesday, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi had tweeted that Bjp should take disciplinary action against Kirti Azad &amp; some other MPs for embarrassing party &amp; playing in the hands of opposition.

&gt;* His critics' counter-argument suggests that Facebook is essentially making a land grab, that the Internet-as-civilising-influence story is little more than colonialism re-invented for the digital age and that online businesses in the developing nations Free Basics purports to serve find it hard to access the platform.

&gt;* The The Times of India report says Reliance is yet to pull the pin on Free Basics and the TRAI's web site and social media presences are silent on the matter.

&gt;* But Facebook can probably bounce back, as Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg seldom miss an opportunity to appear in one another's company, with the former being very bullish on internet access as an economic development tactic.

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: BJP veterans feel the suspension of parliamentarian Kirti Azad for attacking finance minister Arun Jaitley in the DDCA row sends the message that the party is suppressing the voices of its whistleblowers against corruption.The veterans - L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar and Yashwant Sinha - met in New Delhi on Thursday, a day after Azad was suspended for anti-party activities.

&gt;* Sources said the leaders thought Azad's suspension will do the BJP ""more harm than good"".The meeting of the BJP's Margdarshak Mandal also came shortly after Azad sought its intervention in the matter.

&gt;* Apart from Advani, AB Vajpayee and Joshi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah are also the members of the mentor group formed shortly after Modi came to power.Sources said Advani drove down to Joshi's residence and Kumar and Sinha joined them at noon for a meeting that lasted about an hour.

&gt;* The four leaders, who had virtually revolted against the Modi-Shah team after BJP's drubbing in Bihar assembly election last month, are learnt to have discussed the situation arising out of Azad's suspension.They had made a strong public statement after the Bihar poll debacle, saying the party has been ""emasculated"" in the last one year and was being ""forced to kow-tow to a handful"".Cracking the whip on Wednesday, the BJP suspended Azad, who has been leading a campaign against finance minister Arun Jaitley on alleged corruption in DDCA, charging him with anti-party activities and accusing him of ""colluding"" with Congress and AAP to bring it into ""disrepute"".The action of the BJP Parliamentary Board to suspend him from the party's primary membership with immediate effect came three days after his press conference attacking Jaitley and subsequent acts of defiance both inside and outside Parliament.

&gt;* It is a given that all popular personalities hire assistants to handle their social media accounts, but according to the PMO, that is not the case with our Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* In reply to queries filed via RTI applications, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) said that the PM himself updates his Facebook and Twitter accounts.

&gt;* In fact, the Prime Minister had tweeted and uploaded photos on his FB account during his visit to China.

&gt;* The social media accounts of Barack Obama, the President of the United States, for instance, are handled by Organizing for Action staff.

&gt;* The RTI also reveals that the PM was not supplied an iPhone from his office which means that either he has bought it or was gifted one.

&gt;* Under the offsets policy, global defence contractors are required to invest a percentage of the value of any deal in India to help it build a defence industrial base and reduce imports for a military that has emerged as the world's biggest buyer of arms in recent years.

&gt;* India is forecast to spend $250 billion over the next decade to upgrade its military and Modi's government wants a greater role for Indian state and defence firms.

&gt;* Reliance is forging close ties with Russia to jumpstart its ambitions to develop a defence business from scratch.

&gt;* It said it had also discussed joint implementation of modernisation, repair and overhaul of Almaz-Antey systems already in service in India.

&gt;* Earlier this month, Ambani's Reliance Infrastructure took sole management control of Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co which has built patrol vessels for the Indian navy.

&gt; * Referring to the Chandigarh airport as an international airport at Mohali, Badal said a proposal to this effect is already with the Government of India and we all assumed and still remain convinced that considering the massive national following Sardar Bhagat Singh enjoys, no one would even consider opposing the proposal.

&gt; * In a statement released here Wednesday, Badal said there was a general national consensus on naming the airport after Bhagat Singh and a formal and final decision to this effect should be taken without any further loss of time.

&gt; * Taking a snipe at the Haryana government that has recommended that the airport be named after Mangal Sein, a Jan Sangh leader, Badal said, It is distasteful and even an affront to all our great national icons even to drag the issue of naming the international airport at Mohali after Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat into a controversy, said Badal.

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Cutting across partyline, 50 Members of Parliament have raised concern with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the number of rising fatalities and urged for passage of a road safety legislation.

&gt;* ""Soon after you took office last year, our esteemed colleague Gopinath Munde passed away in an unfortunate road accident in Delhi on June 3, 2014.

&gt;* At present, motorised transport in India is governed by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 but in the 27-year period, the deaths caused due to road accidents have increased by 300 per cent, they said adding that with the changed scenario in transportation, the Act has proved to be inadequate in addressing the systemic issues plaguing road safety.

&gt;* The bill seeks to come down heavily on traffic offenders and proposes steep penalties of up to Rs 3 lakh along with a minimum seven-year imprisonment for death of a child in certain circumstances, besides huge fines for driving violations.

&gt;* Besides a heavy penalty for driving related violations, the bill also proposes a fine of Rs 5 lakh per vehicle and an imprisonment for faulty manufacturing design.

&gt;* The four BJP elders who pulled up the party leadership last month over the defeat in Bihar assembly elections, have decided to intervene in the Arun Jaitley vs Kirti Azad controversy which has hit the party.

&gt;* The elders will meet Mr Azad, and raise the issue in party forum instead of going public with their views, sources told NDTV.Mr Azad is likely to meet party veteran Murli Manohar Joshi today at his home, sources said, where veterans LK Advani, Shanta Kumar, Yashwant Sinha met earlier today.Suspended yesterday after he publicly targeted Union finance minister Arun Jaitley with allegations of corruption in the Delhi's cricket body DDCA he once headed, Mr Azad had demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the BJP's margdarshak mandal look into his suspension.

&gt;* The Prime Minister is currently on a visit to Russia.Mr Advani and Mr Joshi are part of the margdarshak mandal -- a five-member group of mentors -- set up last year during a party revamp by party chief Amit Shah in what was seen as a move to sideline the veterans, removing them from the all-powerful parliamentary board.

&gt;* ""In its suspension notice yesterday, the BJP has accused Kirti Azad with colluding with Opposition parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress, with the sole purpose of embarrassing the party and its office bearers.Mr Azad has said he will respond to the party's notice today and another BJP leader Subramanian Swamy would help him frame the reply.The veteran's meeting cames amid speculation that more rebellious heads could roll, among them Shatrughan Sinha, who has described Mr Azad as a ""hero.""

&gt;* It was the latest in a long list of transgressions that has included a scathing assessment on Twitter of why the BJP's strategy in Bihar flopped.Mr Sinha - who also warmly met and congratulated Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav after they defeated the BJP in Bihar - was widely expected to be punished at that time.

158,"For those who couldn't/wouldn't watch the video, here is a summary:

With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting Russia for an annual summit, the focus, as always, is on defence deals. [Several key acquisitions](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-russia-visit-big-guns-blazing/) are expected to be finalised this time -- five S-400 air defence systems, four improved Talwar-class frigates, and 200 Ka-226T light helicopters, among others. More, like the lease of a second nuclear submarine, are in the works.

But the most important, most visible one of them all – the T-50 fifth generation fighter – is ""on the brink of collapse"". His sources in the Indian Air Force tell him that it hasn't lived up to the IAF's expectations, and that the Russians aren't allowing India the kind of access it wants (This was also reported [a couple of years ago](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/russia-can-t-deliver-on-fifth-generation-fighter-aircraft-iaf-114012100059_1.html)). There are several performance shortfalls: the stealth technology ""isn't proven"" (this probably means that the Indian team has not had access to results from the electromagnetic testing), the engines lack sufficient thrust, weapons integration hasn’t been done well enough, and so on. ""You name it, and every department has a problem"", in his words.

The biggest problem, though, is news of Russia cutting back orders to just one squadron's worth, though [it's not the first time this is being reported](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/russia-s-stealth-fighter-is-in-serious-trouble-24ac3ef85227#.6gyawupo1). It shows that the Russians themselves have little confidence in the plane's capabilities, and would prefer buy more Su-35s instead. This is putting the IAF's plans to acquire 225 of the fighters in great jeopardy.

Interestingly, he also reports that the R&amp;D contract hasn't been signed yet. This is spite of the fact that India has already spent INR 1500 crore (approximately 220 million if directly converted to today's dollars without accounting for exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, etc.) on the effort since 2007.",2015-12-24 22:41:11

&gt; * Contrary to Western thinking that India's dependence on Russian arms motivates its relationship, there is much more that drives this unique relationship which Mr Modi has gone to Moscow to revive and cement.

&gt; * Apart from the discussions on strategic interests, security, economic issues and arms related deals what I perceive is that Mr Modi will probably be happy to see the very unique intellectual capital that institutions in Moscow have to offer.

&gt; * In turn, India's improving relationship with China would have greater backing from Russia.

&gt; * Each had its own importance, but in terms of India's classical regional and extra regional interests the issues which the prime minister will discuss and the information that he will come away with will probably be one of the most significant.

&gt; * ""We have agreed to increase mutual investment flows thanks to deeper industrial cooperation and implementation of large-scale infrastructure and energy projects,"" Putin said.Russia launched the first nuclear unit at India's Kudankulam power station in June last year and would complete building another one in ""a matter of a few weeks"", Putin said.

&gt; * He said Russia would build six nuclear blocks in India in 20 years.Modi said the number of Russian-built reactors in Kudankulam and at another site would eventually rise to 12, but gave no timeframe.Russia and India will together build multi-task Kamov-226 helicopters, Modi said.

&gt; * It will be the first large-scale project of the government's ""Make in India"" initiative to encourage local and foreign companies to manufacture in India.A source close to Rosoboronexport, Russia's state-owned arms exporter, had said earlier India would produce 140 of the choppers and Russia the remaining 60.Putin said India and Russia were already successfully producing supersonic, ship-based Brahmos missiles which would be soon delivered to the Indian navy.He said India and Russia planned joint work on a multi-role fighter jet and a transport aircraft, but gave no details.India's ONGC is in talks to increase its stake in the Vankor oilfield in Siberia owned by Russia's top oil producer Rosneft, in line with one of the documents signed in the presence of Putin and Modi.The documents call for cooperation between Russian and Indian companies in offshore and onshore exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Russia.Separately, Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Oil India Limited said they had signed a memorandum with Rosneft, which paves the way for acquisition of a stake in Taas-Yuriakh oil assets in East Siberia.Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom made five large-scale shipments of liquefied natural gas to India this year, Putin said.Putin said Russia's state-controlled diamond corportation Alrosa, which produces 27 percent of all diamonds in the world, would team with India which makes 65 percent of the world's cut diamonds.

&gt; * After the Gujarat riots of 2002, however, Atal seems to have lost out to the RSS.

&gt; * Modi, as is widely known, was a core RSS man who had become the chief minister of a state without being a legislator or an MP.

&gt; * George Fernandes, a minister but not from the BJP, had been given an important position and Atal also took the support of Nitish Kumar and the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, to keep the RSS lobby at bay.

&gt; * In October 2002, a few months after Atal had made a failed bid to make Modi resign, the RSS demanded a high-level meeting with government representatives and the BJP.

250,"Ex CGI Katju did write an article explaining technicalities and addressing it from Legal perspective and according him the Delhi govt *can* form the commission of inquiry(remember Katju is a Modi basher and Kejri basher together. People from both the ""sides"" on Randia have been sharing his stuff, nobody shared this one tho):

&gt;Why Najeeb Jung is wrong about Delhi government's right to order an enquiry into DDCA

&gt;By declaring the enquiry ordered by the Delhi Government to probe into the Delhi &amp; District Cricket Association scam as illegal, Lt Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung has raised an important constitutional and legal question.

&gt;The reasoning given by Jung is that the Delhi government cannot order enquiries as under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 only a state government can order an enquiry, and the Delhi government is not a state government.

&gt;With respect, I submit that the reasoning of Mr Jung is not tenable.

&gt;It is true that under the Commissions of Inquiry Act either the Central government or State government can order an enquiry.

&gt;Section 3 of the Act states:
""(1) The appropriate Government may, if it is of opinion that it is necessary so to do, and shall, if resolution in this behalf is passed by each House of Parliament or, as the case may be, the Legislature of the State, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance and performing such functions and within such time as may be specified in the notification, and the Commission so appointed shall make the inquiry and perform the functions accordingly.""Section 2(a) of the Act defines ""appropriate government"" to mean the Central or state governments.

&gt;The question therefore is whether the Delhi government is a state government

&gt;I submit that it is, though with three limitations: the Delhi legislature cannot legislate in respect of land, police and public order, and hence the Delhi government cannot deal with these three subjects vide Article 162 of the Constitution.

&gt;Article 239AA, which was introduced by the 69th Constitutional Amendment, states :
(1) As from the date of commencement of the Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 the Union Territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory) and the administrator thereof appointed under article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.

&gt;(2) (a) There shall be a Legislative Assembly for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the seats in such Assembly shall be filled by members chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the National Capital Territory.

&gt;(b) The total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly, the number of seats reserved for scheduled castes, the division of the National Capital Territory into territorial constituencies (including the basis for such division) and all other matters relating to the functioning of the Legislative Assembly shall be regulated by law made by Parliament.

&gt;(c) The provisions of articles 324 to 327 and 329 shall apply in relation to the National Capital Territory, the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory and the members thereof as they apply, in relation to a State, the Legislative Assembly of a State and the members thereof respectively and any reference in articles 326 and 329 to “appropriate Legislature” shall be deemed to be a reference to Parliament.

&gt;(3) (a) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State of List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union territories except matters with respect to Entries 1,2, and 18 of the State List and Entries 44, 65 and 66 of that List in so far as they relate to the said Entries 1,2,and 18---""

&gt;Now Article 239AA clearly indicates that after enactment of Article 239AA Delhi is no longer a Union territory. No doubt, it is not called a state but the National Capital Territory, but we have to go by the substance of the matter, not mere nomenclature.

&gt;Delhi has a legislature and a Council of Ministers. Its legislature is empowered to make laws except in matters in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, and those relating to land, police and public order vide Article 239AA(3)(a).

&gt;Hence I submit that Delhi is certainly a State as contemplated by the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.

&gt;Rights and wrongs

&gt;It would be strange to say that the Delhi legislature and Delhi Government, which can deal with all matters except with those in the Union List and land, police and public order, cannot order an enquiry into a matter of public importance such as the alleged DDCA scam Sports are a matter covered by entry 33 of List 2 in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Hence the Delhi government can legislate on the subject, and the Delhi government can deal with it, but how can they legislate or deal with it if they cannot even enquire into it?

&gt;I submit that the word State in Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act must receive a purposive, and not literal, interpretation.

&gt;In this connection, it may be mentioned that, as pointed out by Lord Denning in Notham v. Bamet Council, (1978) 1 WLR 220. the literal interpretation is now completely out of date and has been replaced by the purposive approach referred to by Lord Diplock in Kommins Ballrooms Co. v. Zenith investments Ltd., (1971) AC 850 (881). vide Lord Denning's The Discipline of Law. Chapter II.
10. In Workmen of American Express International Banking Corporation v. Management. AIR 1986 SC 458. the Indian Supreme Court observed:

&gt;""The principles of statutory construction are well-settled In construing legislations the imposture of literal construction must be avoided and the prodigality of its misapplication must be recognised and reduced. Judges ought to be more concerned with the 'colour', the 'content' and the 'context' of such statutes. We have borrowed the words from Lord Wilberforce's opinion in Prenn v. Simmonds. 1971 (3) All ER 237. In the same opinion Lord Wilberforce pointed out that law is not to be left behind in some island of literal interpretation but is to enquire beyond the language, unisolated from the matrix of facts in which they are set ; the law is not to be interpreted purely on internal linguistic considerations. Where legislation is designed to give relief against certain kinds of mischief, the Court is not to make inroads by making etymological excursions.""

&gt;11. Similarly, in Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. Ashok Vishnu Kate. 1995 (6) SCC 326. the Supreme Court said :

&gt;""Francis Bennton in his Statutory Interpretation Second Edn.. has dealt with the Functional Construction Rule in Part XV of his book. The nature of purposive construction is dealt with in Part XX at page 659 thus :

&gt;""A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives effect to the legislative purpose by :

&gt;(a) following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose (in this Code called a purposive-and-literal construction), or,

&gt;(b) applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in accordance with the legislative purpose (in the Code called a purposive-and-strained construction).""

&gt;At p. 661 of the same book, the author has considered the topic of ""Purposive Construction"" in contrast with literal construction. The learned author has observed as under :

&gt;""Contrast with literal construction--Although the term 'purposive construction' is not new, its entry into fashion betokens a swing by the appellate courts away from literal construction. Lord Diplock said in 1975 : 'If one looks back to the actual decisions of the [House of Lords) on questions of statutory construction over the last 30 years one cannot fail to be struck by the evidence of a trend away from the purely literal towards the purposive construction of statutory provisions'. The matter was summed up by Lord Diplock in this way :

&gt;...I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task on which a Court of justice is engaged remains one of construction, even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in it.""

&gt;The above decisions thus clearly show that in England as well as in our country also, now the purposive approach is being preferred to the literal approach in statutory construction.

&gt;Accordingly, I submit, the reasoning of Mr Najeeb Jung is untenable.",2015-12-25 20:31:25

&gt;* India is in favour of expanding trade and travel activities between the two countries and recent developments, including the NSA-level talks, are likely to provide impetus to the proposal.

&gt;* After her trip, Sushma said the government had decided to re-start comprehensive dialogue on various subjects, including terrorism and Jammu and Kashmir.

&gt;* Naresh Chandra Task Force on National Security in a report in 2012 had recommended opening of nine additional routes.

You are correct on utility prices - something that Indian government subsidizes.  That's for electricity at least.  Gasoline and diesel are more expensive in India.  (Right now, in Jersey, we are paying $1.90 per gallon of gasoline.)  And road tolls are rather pricey in India, too...

If I buy the same Iphone with a very similar internet and calling options, prices in India are more expensive, not less.  Not to even mention the whole [3G/4G mess in India.](http://www.dailyo.in/technology/digital-india-week-modi-information-technology-4g-3g-internet-connectivity/story/1/4703.html)   It is true that India has some very 'budget' options for poor people that are cheaper - but these are not comparable products.  It's the same as comparing a 220cc Pulsar to 600ss Honda.  

And you are correct for entertainment and low skilled labor in general. Things that use low skilled labor are very cheap in India.  Most Americans can't afford a house maid/etc.  In the USA, I'm paying $90-$120/hour for a sportbike mechanic.  

As you mention, most people spend their money on a few life basics; (1) housing, (2) food, etc.  Housing/price of land/construction is more expensive in India.  Food is not as cheap in India as we perceive it to be, either. (which is why Indian food is really cheap but if you try to get other things, it's USA prices.)   It's often a question of cheap ingredients.  (onions, curries, breads, grains/rices.)  If we actually check prices for 1 pound of chicken, India is not that cheap either.  India is surprisingly expensive even for food.  The allure of India is cheap labor that actually turns cheap ingredients into good food, that's where the value is.  ",2015-12-26 02:55:49

---

&gt; * India's premier defence research agency's missile tech unit signs an MoU with the Tirumala temple to conduct scientific research on Vedas.

&gt; * Now, the Narendra Modi government is taking it all to the logical end.India's premier defence research agency the Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation (DRDO) has gone right ahead to sign a memorandum of understanding with the cash-rich Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) to conduct scientific research on the Vedas to scout for possible secrets pertaining to missile technologies hidden in the ancient scriptures.The MoU with TTD was signed by the Hyderabad-based Research Centre Imarat (RCI)-DRDO to conduct scientific research on the Vedas.

&gt; * But nothing has been conclusively proved so far.In fact, a 1974 study titled ""A critical study of the work Vymanika Shastra"" (Science of aeronautics),conducted by researchers of the Indian Institute of Science into 'ancient scriptures' pertaining to aviation technologies claimed to have been handed down by Sage Bharadwaj, were actually found to be a modern works, somewhere between 1918 and 1923.The study, which was then published in the journal Scientific Opinion on four 'planes' described in Vymanika Shastra - Shakuna Vimana, Sundara Vimana, Rukma Vimana and Tripura Vimana - and claimed to have been given by the ancient sage, were at best ""poor concoctions rather than expressions of something real"".

&gt; * ""None of the planes has properties or capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them resist rather than assist (in) flying,"" the researchers said in their study's conclusions.They also concluded that the texts and the drawings did not correlate with each other ""even thematically"", suggesting that such claims were only figments of imagination by the author.Similarly, none of the mythological claims to high-end technologies in the ancient Indian past have found scientific basis despite various studies being conducted on the issue.The TTD has established the Centre for Veda Science Research (CVSR) for promoting research in the field and has recognised seven patasalas as 'centres of excellence' in Vedic studies to give a fillip to oral tradition of dissemination of Vedas.Eminent scientists will guide the project, but no further details were available on who they might be.The President inaugurated a new Veda Pathasala (school) set up by the TTD at I Bheemavaram village in Akiveedu Mandal of West Godavari district.The TTD has constructed I Bheemavaram Vedic School at a cost of Rs 4.7 crore.

&gt;* The renewed diplomatic push comes after the massacre in Paris last month, which intensified global efforts toroot out terrorism and fight the spread of Islamic State.

&gt;* Its a positive development, said Uday Bhaskar, director at the Society for Policy Studies in New Delhi, pointing to the series of meetings in recent months as a sign of traction.

&gt;* These developments have indeed caused everyone anguish and distress, saidHafiz Saeed, the founder of militant outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head as the suspected mastermind of the Mumbai attacks.

&gt;* The last Indian prime minister to visit Pakistan was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who traveled to Islamabadin January 2004 for a regional summit, where he met then-President Pervez Musharraf.

&gt; * MUMBAI: Two tweets sent the national chatterati into a frenzy on Christmas Day.The first was from Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who decided to take a surprise detour on his return home from Russia and Afghanistan to Lahore and wish his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on his birthday.Then, an hour later, steel and power conglomerate JSW Group's boss Sajjan Jindal too took to the micro-blogging site to announce, ""In Lahore to greet PM Navaz (sic) Sharif on his birthday"".Jindal's was a seemingly innocuous tweet, but it appeared to betray a deeper secret.

&gt; * Before that, ET had reported in June last year how Sharif had dropped in at Jindal's home for tea when he visited Delhi for Modi's swearing-in ceremony.Is Sajjan Jindal the new RK Mishra  a one-time corporate confidant of prime ministers of India and Pakistan who was used for back-channel negotiations in an otherwise fractious and convoluted relationship?Mishra, a veteran journalist with the Patriot and Link newspapers and the founding chairman of Reliance's Observer Research Foundation, was considered close to the group's late founder Dhirubhai Ambani.

&gt; * Mishra was believed to have been used by the Vajpayee establishment during the height of Kargil war for track-II talks with Islamabad.So more than a decade later, is Sajjan Jindal the new 'facilitator' for Indo-Pak dialogue?While he could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts to contact him on his cellphone, he seemed to have come in the crosshairs of political sniping.

&gt; * ""To be sure, both Jindals and Sharif family have been personal friends for generations with similar business interests in steel.Nawaz Sharif 's father Muhammad Sharif started his business empire in 1939 with a small steel mill  Ittefaq Ltd, which over the years has transformed itself into one of the largest steelmaking units there.

http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/05/india-modi-kerry-pollution-climate-change/

Notice how China does not come up in ""most polluted lists"" anymore and all the attention has been give to India? Thats because China and the U.S reached a deal. West can keep crying :D 

&gt; India is still a poor country, where 300 million people still have no access to electricity, and in which a little less than that number live below the poverty line. The harsh reality is that given these grim figures, economic development will rightfully trump concerns about air pollution for at least the next few decades. Only now is the Indian economy starting to takeoff, following several years in the doldrums. Soon, India’s growth rate will overtake China’s. A big push to reduce air pollution now would stall India’s growth engines before take off.

&gt; It’s noteworthy that the approaching launch of AirNow has been met with silence from Indian officials. Perhaps they’re hoping that the system will fly below the radar, although this seems unlikely. Or perhaps they expect that India’s own shift toward green energy, including the coal tax hike announced in the recent budget, will silence critics. Fat chance. You can bet that when AirNow goes live in the coming months, it will get daily coverage in newspapers, television, and social media, just as it did in China. Everyone loves a ranking. And, again, just as in China, you can bet that there will be news stories about expats declining opportunities to work in India because of concern about air quality.

&gt; After all, if the famously obtuse officials in Beijing buckled under the public pressure over air pollution, how long will Indian officials, better known for reacting to situations than anticipating them, be able to hold out before they cave?

&gt;* Though the IOC-OIL combine is seeking 29%, which could be worth in excess of $1 billion.Rosneft sold 20% in Tass-Yuryakh to BP for $750 million in October and is negotiating with another company .OVL had made its last big deal in 2009 by acquiring Imperial Energy .

&gt;* The oil sector agreements, reached as part of the annual summit between PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin, we re overshadowed by weightier deals in defence and nuclear power.

&gt;* But Kremlin was not keen amid high crude prices and Putin's nationalist views on ownership of oil and gas resources.New Delhi developed an aver sion to Russian acquisitions after buyout of Imperial Energy turned sour.

&gt;* Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif should not sacrifice Kashmir for his personal friendship with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, said Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group founder Hafiz Mohammed Saeed in a video released on Saturday.

&gt;* A known anti-India hate-monger who is accused of plotting the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008, Saeeds three-minute-long video on the Twitter handle of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the charity he heads, came a day after Modis accomplished a diplomatic coup with an unannounced stopover in Pakistan to wish Sharif on his birthday.

&gt;* But we mustnt forget that this is the same Modi who previously during his visit to Bangladesh openly took credit for breaking Pakistan into two and admitted being part of the volunteer-movement that actively participated, said Saeed, whose JuD is considered a front of the Lashkar.

&gt;* What kind of message is given to Kashmiris by a private Modi-Sharif meeting, asked the terror kingpin who carries a $10 million US bounty on his head but considered close to the Pakistani security establishment.

&gt;* He made another outrageous allegation that the 2014 Peshawar military school attack, where more than 140 children and teachers were gunned down by Pakistan Taliban terrorists, was a celebration of the fall of Dhaka (1971) as both happened on December 16.

&gt; * On foreign policy, Modi has done two major things.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Soon, you could get an e-mail or SMS straight from the Prime Minister informing you of a new policy decision or even an urgent alert in national interest.The e-Sampark initiative launched as a part of 'Digital India' last year is now being extended to private citizens, especially professionals, for building a direct citizen connect on various issues, policies and programmes of the government.

&gt; * So far, e-Sampark database has 80 lakh email addresses and over 1 crore mobile numbers of central and state government officials sourced from the NIC  42 crore e-mails and SMSs have been sent so far by the Prime Minister's Office or Central Ministries to them.The government will now be opening up the system on a crowd-sourcing model, where people can sign up for the service on a portal for getting alerts from the PMO and other ministries.

&gt; * This gap will be filled by the optimum use of e-Sampark database... the government envisages use of the database for diverse purposes like feedback, policy information, alerts etc.,"" says an order issued by the Centre on December 3.The order adds that in the near future, the database will also include the database of professionals in the country and information, alerts, feedback for a programme and policy drafts can hence be sent to a ""targeted user base"" thereby ""improving the efficiency of governance and e-governance efforts.

&gt; * ""The government has also specified the kind of messages that can be sent to the ""target user base"" using the e-Sampark database, namely  ""information pertaining to an existent or proposed policy or decision of the government, launch of new schemes, issue related to initiate citizen awareness, urgent alerts in national or public interest, government updates and outcomes related to global interactions and greetings for generating goodwill.

&gt; * Prime Minister Narendra Modis combative style of politics has triggered an informal competition among his political opponents to counter him as ferociously and also become the face of the opposition forces arrayed against the Bharatiya Janata Party.

&gt; * This is because the necessary prerequisite to become the face of the opposition demands the leader must trounce the BJP in an election in which Modi campaigns vigorously.In this sense, not only is Modi dictating opposition politics, but even the extent of his participation in state election campaigns will determine who plays the lead in blowing the bugle against the BJP.It was primarily through their election victories that both Kejriwal and Kumar entered the informal competition for inheriting the leadership mantle of the opposition.

&gt; * His refusal has reinforced his outsider image, which is precisely what his supporters and, now, the Left-liberal constituencies increasingly want.For instance, Kejriwals description of Modi as a psychopath was denounced in all newspaper editorials, but earned him admiration from many who are opposed to the BJP but who cant be counted among his supporters.

&gt; * For instance, in case Mayawati wins Uttar Pradesh, would she too vie to become for the same spot.As this informal competition stiffens, it must be said that Modis politics of giving no quarters to the opposition, his inclination to become the predominant leader of Indian politics, has triggered a realignment and made the opposition think of, and prepare for, the 2019 Lok Sabha election so early in his tenure.

&gt; * ""Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan have already requested India to provide specialized training to their personnel and help in raising a specialized force like the NDRF,"" said Santosh Kumar, director of the National Institute of Disaster Management in the home ministry.Kumar, who is also the director of the New Delhi-based Saarc Disaster Management Centre, said the home ministry has accepted the proposals of these countries and may soon impart training and capacity building support to their forces.Prime minister Narendra Modi's key aide and additional principal secretary P K Mishra is the man behind the government's greater push towards disaster diplomacy.

&gt; * Mishra recently participated in a deliberation on ""disasters without bordersregional resilience for sustainable development"" and spoke about key strategies in achieving this goal.Kumar said India has also volunteered to host the Saarc common disaster response force at its Delhi-NCR facility where it already has a training centre for its 10- battalion strong NDRF comprising of over 11,500 soldiers drawn from its paramilitary forces of BSF, CRPF, CISF, SSB and ITBP.After the Nepal earthquakes in April this year, New Delhi had organized one of the biggest rescue and relief operations in the Himalayan nation.

&gt; * However, India had even then actively engaged Pakistan at the highest level in strategizing rescue efforts, said a senior home ministry official.

377,"But the Congress leader could still gather strength as crucial states go to the polls over the next two years.

&gt; * As of now, there are three principal competitors  Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and chief ministers Arvind Kejriwal and Nitish Kumar.The number of competitors wishing to become the anti-BJP, anti-Modi face is likely to grow as certain electorally crucial states have their Assembly polls over the next two years.

&gt; * This is because the necessary prerequisite to become the face of the opposition demands the leader must trounce the BJP in an election in which Modi campaigns vigorously.In this sense, not only is Modi dictating opposition politics, but even the extent of his participation in state election campaigns will determine who plays the lead in blowing the bugle against the BJP.It was primarily through their election victories that both Kejriwal and Kumar entered the informal competition for inheriting the leadership mantle of the opposition.

&gt; * It might also enable AAP to make forays in other states, especially where the electoral contest is between the Congress and BJP.Ultimately, it is about who captures the popular imagination across the country, becomes the face of the anti-BJP constituency, and the tally of seats his party wins in the next Lok Sabha election.

&gt; * For instance, in case Mayawati wins Uttar Pradesh, would she too vie to become for the same spot.As this informal competition stiffens, it must be said that Modis politics of giving no quarters to the opposition, his inclination to become the predominant leader of Indian politics, has triggered a realignment and made the opposition think of, and prepare for, the 2019 Lok Sabha election so early in his tenure.

&gt;* With the issue of Akhand Bharat gaining spotlight after BJP general secretary Ram Madhavs statement that he believed India, Pakistan and Bangladesh will reunite to form a united India once again, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) said on Sunday that the issue was a cultural concept and not a political one.

&gt;* When asked to comment on Madhavs statement on Akhand Bharat (united India), Sinha said it is a political issue and that Bharatiya Janata Party should answer that as to why he made such statement and what he means by his Akhand Bharat.

&gt;* For RSS Akhand Bharat is not a programme, it is our ideal; that this land is one India, which is called as punya bhumi (sacred land), he added.

&gt;* The division of India was unnatural, but that can be undone only when people of Bangladesh and Pakistan, accept pre-Islamic Indian culture and ethos that is based on Indonesian model.

&gt;* Ram Madhav, had earlier said that the Sangh believes that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh will one day reunite again not by war but through popular goodwill, the comment came when Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise stopover in Lahore for a meeting with Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif.

&gt; * They received unexpected support from Gujarat government officials,especially police officers like Rahul Sharma, R.B.

&gt; * These officers were later joined by other police officers like Satish Verma (member, SIT for the Ishrat Jahan Encounter case and seconded to the Central Bureau of Investigationfor the investigation as per High Court orders), Rajnish Rai (initial investigator for the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case and responsible for the first arrests of high ranking police officers) and Kuldip Sharma (responsible for pursuing a corruption case which involved Amit Shah the Rs 1200 crore Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative Bank case).

&gt; * The Gujarat government, in an act of unexpected grace, finally withdrew the chargesheet against Rahul Sharma which had been used to block his promotion after he took voluntary retirement from the IPS.

&gt; * Another similarity between Rahul Sharma and Satish Verma is that much like Rahul Sharma was sought to be charged with giving false evidence because he handed over copies of the CDR, Satish Verma was sought to be charged with theft and intimidation because he seized hard disks from the Gujarat Forensic Science Laboratory as part of the investigation into the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case.

---

&gt;* All peace-loving citizens on both sides will be praying and hoping for permanent political solution and peace between both nations, which has eluded till now.

&gt;* While no fixed time frame can be put for complicated negotiations, one simple measure can improve our mutual trust and increase spending on one of the most important areas for both nations: human development.

&gt;* Due to mutual distrust and tensions at the border, both nations continue to increase the defense spending significantly in successive years while a huge section of our population lives in abject poverty, with not able to afford two square meals a day.

&gt;* So, lets make a solid step towards peace and at the same time, invest in our own people rather than increased defense spending which only profits weapons manufacturers around the world.

&gt;* Please make an announcement to cut 10% of military spending for next year and redirect it towards Health, Education, and Poverty alleviation programs.

Free market has been repeatedly proved to be wrong in it's extreme form(Exhibits pre WW1 Britain, Germany, pre WW2 America where the conditions of labourers were inhuman to say the least and corporate greed kicked off the Great Depression) and thus liberals have moved to demanding a mixed market where the Govt has some control over the industries. This market has led to the high standards of living in the US or Western Europe or Australia right now. Free market, one uncontrolled in any way does **NOT** work. Supply side economics do **NOT** work.

3)Ghaar waapasi is criticized because it is done under the tutelage of the organization which makes BJP leaders or breaks them.

419,"First of all, I am not against liberalism and in fact I consider myself to be a fairly liberal. 

Secondly, I don't claim that there are no liberals in India. Surely there are some true liberals. However the most liberals, if we go by MSM certification, aren't really liberals (including the political parties like congress and many journalists and artists). That's the OP's question and my response- *that most self acclaimed liberals aren't so.* 

As to your points,

&gt; Liberalism has changed over decades since that definition was true. Free market has been repeatedly proved to be wrong in it's extreme form

Yes, true when you talk of extreme form. 

The whole aspect of economics and liberals positioning in that context is evolving and a separate argument. I was just focusing on wiki definition here for simplicity. But I take you point. One need not be a free market at-all-cost champion to be a liberal.  

&gt; 1) I describe myself as a liberal and, I wrote, admittedly low quality erotica involving representatives of the two major religions here including gasp Mohamed. Not all liberals are the same and I mourn those killed by Muslim terrorists just as much as I mourn the rationalists killed by Hindu ones.

It's not necessary for a liberals to ridicule or draw or eroticise religious figures. But its necessary for them to stand up for people who do and subsequently get hounded/harassed. Like the case of Shirin Dalvi a Muslim woman editor who republished Charlie Hebdo cartoons and got ostracized from the community but not many liberals spoke for her and neither did they create a hype/issue about her.   

&gt; 2)These same newspapers which conservatives have a hate boner for were the ones who created the Modi wave. They were the ones who attacked the UPA Govt viciously over it's numerous scams, an act just as laudable as now when it attacks Bhagwat or Sakshi Maharaj.

Media isn't totally one-sided, I admit. They are extremely biased though and therefor not Free. But tbh, some bias would creep in no matter what. However they are corrupt too (with enough money/perks you can buy the coverage you want). This is debatable. But there are enough examples like in Radia tapes, Essar emails. 

&gt; 3)Ghaar waapasi is criticized because it is done under the tutelage of the organization which makes BJP leaders or breaks them. The Govt is supposed to be removed from all trappings of religion and, when the body that Naidu claims is the ""parent"" of the BJP converts people, that's indeed grounds for concern.

As I said criticizing RSS is one thing, but if the practice of religion is free then conversion can not be criticized not matter who is doing it (if it is not coercive). I didn't see many liberals saying that ghar wapasi is fine and okay but RSS should not do it. 

&gt; 4)Once again, a lot of us want UCC. Well, I would like it if polygamy ban on Hindus were removed, too and people could just do whatever the fuck they want in their personal life, an aspect the Govt has absolutely no business poking it's nose in.

You do, but its not your conduct under debate. We are talking about the famous and popular liberal icons. 

&gt; 5)And RSS killed Gandhi. Should we blame Bhagwat for the murder of Gandhi? Indira is dead, her son is dead, let bygones by bygones.

Her grandson and DIL are still there. hehe

Jokes apart, important difference is that RSS killing Gandhi isn't a fact but a matter of opinion while Emergency of Indira and Congress party is a fact. 

Also, I am not saying that ban congress party for it but we should at least have some perspective and sense of history before labeling congress a liberal party. That's all I ask for.

Most of us, common people.

438,"/u/rorschach34 has given a pretty accurate answer. I will just try to add another view to this.

*  They mock because it is easy to call someone an ""Libtard"" and trivialize his viewpoints instead of actually responding with a reasonable counter argument. The same can be seen from opposing point of view too i.e calling someone right-wing nut jobs, or modi-bhakts or whatever.

* Most people who resort to name calling may think that people have to fall in one of the predefined buckets or groups that have fixated in their minds. Someone can be ""Liberal"" in his social outlook but ""conservative"" in economical outlook or ""conservative"" in may be a different aspect of social life where they think it is better than the ""Liberal"" view. These people will be viewed as hypocrites or ""Pseudo-liberals"". I really don't understand why you can't have multiple views as a person about different issues?

* Regarding protesting against Muslims and Hindus equally. There are many people who have done this but those people will not be shown as examples of Liberalism. Whenever you question a book ban by any right-wing group, we get the question of where are you during Taslima Nasreen or Salman Rushdie? The thing is there are people who are actually fighting this fight against all governments. You just choose to ignore them.


Now for the most controversial opinion:

I think the ""Urban Hindu Male"" of today feels his voice has been somehow muffled for long and other communities like Muslims/Dalits have been given unfair advantages in the form reservations, appeasements, subsidiaries etc. With the emergence of social media and the election of Modi as PM there is  both a medium to express his voice against the ""perceived wrong doings"" and also an environment where he finds support to those ideas.

439,"&gt; Saying objectively what i feel is right, you getting offended by 'muslim' word not mentioned in headline is parochial, bad and dangerous for a progressive society.
&gt; 

My bad if my post was ambiguous. I think why I am angry is because Indian media leaves no stone unturned when a Hindu sick fuck does something bad. They would mention rising intolerance, rise of hindu extremism, RSS agenda, award wapsi, Modi bashing and what not. 

However, here when the roles are reversed they have kept quiet. To give you an idea this incident happened 7 days back and we are getting to hear about this now. Generally I get notifications from TOIet, NDTV on phone when incidents of such magnitude happen (Like the Ggn abduction case today). But here nothing like that happened.


I can bet Indian media would have got a massive hard on if the sick fuck here was a hindu. By t+6 hours, half of Indian social media would have known. By t+12 hours, Arnab would be shouting. By t+18 hours, western media would have reported and half of reddit would have known. By t+36 hours, left leaders would have pandered to their own agenda of spewing bullshit and politicizing the entire ordeal.

Quite likely that he meant **your** in a general sense. Mehdi Hassan interpreted it as his. Ram Madhav should have immediately clarified, but he wasn't quick enough there. Probably a habit from Indian TV shows, where you can't admit mistakes come what may.

**Akhand Bharat**

Countries coming together has always been discussed, and Ram Madhav has a right to discuss it too. However, his organisation RSS has a concept of Akhand Bharat, which no neighbouring country of India will accept for the foreseeable future. Therefore, when Madhav says a union of the subcontinent, it will always be interpreted as the Akhand Bharat of RSS. Nothing surprising there. The very next day, RSS themselves said Akhand Bharat is not possible soon - meaning, they themselves saw his statement as a mention of Akhand Bharat.

Next, the timing. A statement about Akhand Bharat within 24 hours of Modi meeting Sharif? What a beautiful way to sabotage the talks - you would think the ISI made him say it, to ensure no talks happen between India Pak.",2015-12-28 21:23:47

&gt; * NEW DELHI: With an eye on making Indian funding attractive amid massive Chinese funded projects in the developing world, the Modi government has approved the new Indian Development Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) to streamline Lines Of Credit (LOC) offered to various countries in South Asia , SE Asia, Africa and Central America emphasizing on timely completion of projects.Timely completion of projects under Line Of Credit scheme and other assistance programs across countries have been key complaint of the recipient countries.

&gt; * The initiative includes provisions to provide better terms of credit, which will be attractive to many developing countries, who are now seeking alternative means of finance , according to MoS (External Affairs) V K Singh.In a reply to Lok Sabha last week on the progress of various LoC funded projects, Singh informed that several changes have been made in the operational guidelines such as making Detailed Project Report, strengthening of monitoring system, pre-qualification of competent companies and requirement of regular reports by the borrowing governments.

&gt; * ""These changes should improve the implementation of projects undertaken through these LOCs,"" hoped Singh.While India with a benign image enjoys tremendous goodwill across continents as it neither impose projects nor is prescriptive in its approach, pace of project implementation has been Achilles Hill for various reasons including delay in meeting deadlines even for projects given as grants, a source who did not wish to be identified said.But the Modi government, with India's limited resources, hopes to correct its record amid China's growing commitments to aid developing countries.

&gt; * Between 2008-15 Exim Bank has disbursed $ 11,678 million as LOCs for various development related and capacity building projects across continents.Over a decade back in 2003-04, the then Vajpayee government formulated the Indian Development Initiative (IDI), now known as Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) - with the objective of sharing India's development experience through (a) capacity building and skills transfer, (b) trade, and (c) infrastructure development, by extending concessional Lines of Credit (LOCs) routed through Exim Bank, to developing partner countries, towards creating socio-economic benefits in the partner country.India's development partnership is based on the needs identified by the partner countries and the effort of the Ministry is geared towards accommodating as many of the requests received from partner countries as is technically and financially possible, pointed out an official familiar with the developments In 2012 The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) created the Development Partnership Administration (DPA) Division to deal with India's development assistance programmes abroad, including LoCs routed through Exim Bank.

&gt;* Some of these changes  particularly to do with subsidies and taxes  will be unpopular with the electorate in the short term, which is why governments traditionally take such measures soon after being elected in the hope the longer-term benefits will have manifested themselves by the time the voters return to the polls.

&gt; * A large number of Afghans, known for their valour and chivalry, equipped the forces of the rulers of Rajasthan with strong Afghan horses.A large number of Pathans served as soldiers in various forces of the erstwhile princely states of Rajasthan.The CPWD had invited tenders for building the green marble fountain and Udaipur's Natural Handicraft's Pvt Ltd had won that contract.The fountain was built by over two dozen artisans who worked day and night to give the rocks of green marble the shape of a fountain.

475,"&gt; When I said you can't say a word against gay people, I meant this exact situation. Where I say that other issues are more important, but I get downvoted and reported and heavily criticized. 

I didn't downvote you and wish they didn't. I am upvoting each of your posts right now because I strongly disagree with the practice of downvoting. In fact, at the time of this writing some of your posts now have more upvotes than mine - not really a problem for me.

But I must say this: you got imaginary negative points on a website by strangers, that must be really bad. Surely it's far worse than when the Pope (who is admittedly far more liberal than his predecessors) calls it a ""defeat for humanity"" when gays get rights in a democratic referendum. Surely it's orders of magnitude worse than being held responsible for earthquakes, AIDS and having to see signs that say ""God hats fags"". And Ramdev and co saying that you need a cure because of your sexual orientation can in no way come anywhere close to a few downvotes on a website.

And of course a few downvotes feel far far worse than when you play a significant part in winning a World War for your country and a few years later get prosecuted for the ""crime"" of being gay in the same country that gave us 377.

You are right, in a world where several countries (this one included) have made it a *crime* to be gay, the anti-gay people are the ones who do not find an outlet for their views. 


&gt; I'm saying gay rights gets more attention than far more severe social issues. 

And as I've pointed out time and again, *that is demonstrably false*. If you think poverty doesn't get attention, why do you think we have so many programs such as PDS, NREGA, SSA etc? Why do you think every govt talks about development (no, Modi did not invent that), jobs, loan waivers, toilets and the like? While they may often not explicitly be sold as poverty alleviation, the ultimate goal is either alleviation or improving living conditions among the poor. Not only do they get attention, they get serious govt money to support them. Plus you really should educate yourself about the number of NGOs, CSRs etc that work in that area - then you can come and say it gets attention.

The fact that they don't work as they should is a major sign that poverty is not such a simple problem to solve, that there are several interconnected problems that become a formidable challenge, one that cannot go away overnight with the push of a button - unlike 377 which can.


&gt; But I didn't ask for that. Its not one or the other. 

Then stop connecting the two.


&gt; I'm using this opportunity to tell people that there are far more grave social issues that isn't as well marketed as gay rights, that need national attention.

Then continue marketing the issues you prefer. You don't have to run down a genuine issue because there are other genuine issues too. I can find any number of genuine issues and say ""ignore &lt;&lt;issue_X&gt;&gt; until you fix &lt;&lt;issue_Y&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;issue_Z&gt;&gt;""


&gt; Imagine talking to a group of people who dismiss a speech about children with bleak futures, but get all excited when a Bollywood star wants gay people to kiss in public

Right, so some of those who support Tharoor on 377 are idiots. Every idea on earth, no matter how profound and praiseworthy, has a certain number of idiots supporting it. That has nothing to do with the actual merits of 377 (or lack thereof).",2015-12-29 15:34:19

India is not intolerant. And we will boycott and viciously bully anyone who says so.

Modi can do no wrong. RSS can do no wrong.

All petty thefts and fisticuffs against Indians are organised by global jihadi forces.

These outsiders were actually morons, hypocrites and thoroughly evil. (actually this tradition is not even ancient, it was invented in 19th century.)

Indian constitution is also an evil design against the upper castes. Change it.

Courts are always right. If you want the truth and justice just tamper with all the evidence , intimidate all the witnesses and procure your clean chit (TM).

&gt;* In the past 50 days, not a single incident of ceasefire violation by the Pakistan army has been reported along the Line of Control.

&gt;* In fact, Modi has met his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif twice in less than a month, and this seems to have contributed to ensuring peace along the LoC.

&gt;* Resumption of the peace process with Pakistan began with Modi meeting Sharif on the sidelines of the Paris climate summit on November 30.

&gt;* On December 6, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval met his Pakistani counterpart Naseer Khan Janjua in Bangkok, following which Sushma attended the Heart of Asia Conference in Islamabad.

&gt;* On December 9, Sushma held talks with Nawaz Sharifs foreign affairs advisor Sartaz Aziz in Islamabad, in which both sides agreed to launch comprehensive dialogue stalled since 2012.

497,"&gt;I have four words for you: ""Crony capitalism"": See: Mundra; island yoga for noodle baba. ""Kool-Aid"": 

Two words for you: Low. Effort. You're just repeating mindless memes passed around in internet circlejerks without doing even basic research on a single one.

-Most of the land acquisition for Mundra was before Modi became CM, it was barren, regarded unsuitable for cultivation and the Modi govt actually charged Adani more per sq m than earlier administrations.

-Patanjali has been invited to bid for that island; at the least they're going to be paying the market value

-I don't suffer from selective amnesia. The media has been intermittently supportive of and extremely critical of Modi. Before he won in 2014 it was mostly the latter.

All it would take is a few minutes of googling to uncover details about the above. But that would break the stereotype and circlejerk, wouldn't it?

I am in no way suggesting you support BJP or refrain from abusing it or whatever. It's your right and you have some legitimate points. But have a modicum of objectivity and don't let your entire vision be completely crowded by preconcieved notions and hatred for cowdung/communalism etc. The memories of 2002 may be unforgettable and horrible, but that doesn't necessate having to see everything through the prism of *'BJP da WURST! Everything else is better! Lalu, Pappu, Mulayam are BETTAH! Believe!'*

And like I said which completely went above your head, voting for BJP is not a 'communal vote'. Most people who do so because of being more economically right-wing, having more focus on development politics over populism etc. You can claim it is false but it's disingenuous to attack 30-40% of the Indian electorate as 'communal' voters.
