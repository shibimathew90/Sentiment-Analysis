5,"Your question touches on a number of concepts covered in an intro macroeconomics class. 

Let's take the example of pens. In a perfect free market economy with no regulations, no taxes, no subsidies, nothing, a pen would cost you Rs. 10. At that price, all of India will demand a total of, say, 1 lakh pens. Say the price of plastic goes up- then the production cost for the pen will increase, and the price go to, say, Rs. 12. At that price, demand for pens will fall to only 90,000 -- 10,000 people ran a mini cost-benefit analysis and decided ""no, at Rs. 12, buying a pen isn't worth it for me as I only have 10 or maybe 11 rupees worth of utility (use/pleasure) from it."" OTOH, if plastic prices go down and pens become cheaper to only Rs. 8, 1.2 lakh people will buy pens - 20,000 people will say ""ah, I derive 8 (or 9) rupees of utility from a pen, I will buy one now."" And by this price-driven mechanism, demand and supply fluctuates.

When you put a subsidy on pens, you make them artificially cheaper. The government says ""OK, for votes, we are going to make pens Rs. 8 with government subsidies."" The market is not determining this. There is no new technology or market development really making pens worth Rs. 8 -- it's just the whim of a government policy. So, as we said before, at that price, 1.2 lakh pens will be sold. This means 20,000 more pens are being demanded than what the market would have ordained. The resources behind 20,000 pens - the plastic, ink, packaging, labor for all of this, managerial expertise, petrol for transport, etc. - are being artificially diverted from more efficient production.

Therefore, making pens cheaper and raising their demand makes a lot of other things more expensive. Petrol, labor, managerial expertise, plastic, ink, etc. that could've gone to practically anything else are being artificially diverted into pens. So industries that use those goods must pay more, thereby raising prices. 

You probably still don't get it; it's a small and shitty example. I'd suggest going to Khan Academy or something and watching all the Macroeconomics videos up until Aggregate Supply and Demand to understand what Modi is saying here. Just know that, unlike pens, subsidizing huge things like railroads, rural welfare programs, etc. is a lot more of a strain than pens. Huge constrains. That's why many cities are reporting trouble with getting domestic servants/maids, while people are sitting idle with NREGA money in villages. ",2014-07-01 02:36:42

**Cause for increase in prices**
economy is about balancing the country's balance sheet and income statements. With very little alternative to oil imports, what would a 'young' government do to try and balance the budget for the time being? Increase oil prices. That is what has happened. UPA on the other hand did this consecutively for 10 years.

**Reason for that hoarding**
After 10 years and around 100 times increase in oil prices, that hoarding is justified. Now that the BJP government is in power, it remains to be seen if alternative sources of energy are explored in their tenure. But really you cannot find fault with one increase in one month. Why can't you wait before you point fingers?

13,"&gt;So why did he not understand all this when he was in opposition only a month back?

Dude, after 10 years in power who can the UPA blame but themselves? they lacked vision. Never looked for long term prospectives. That is the cause for petrol hike. When your country solely depends on oil and your country has no other significant alternative, apart from coal (which is under dispute in the SC), what would you expect?
The oil prices have been soaring in the world market and what must a responsible government in India do ? 
Transfer the price rise to the consumers or should it play politics by straining the economy even further....just for short term gains?

 
Seriously, if you expect BJP and modi to get 10000 MW of solar energy in one month, you got to be seriously introspecting.

His basics are pretty strong. He is fighting with world powers over a 'patent issue' for solar energy. Relax and watch how he deals with the energy crisis of India.

You should reread my previous comment where I decimate this logic of yours.

to pay as much importance to this rhetoric. But, since you raised this issue, I will say that the BJP did allow multiple bills to be passed under UPA. check your facts. Also, most of those bills were amended by the BJP policy makers since, fools had taken over congress.


&gt;Have you ever criticised Modi? I doubt it too.

No. you don't have to doubt it. I never criticized him, because could not find ONE SINGLE point to. All of the allegations are either wild or pending in courts (to be judged upon by judges, not me). The recent allegations on him for hypocrisy are your (and other congis) over zealous mindset to see him fail. These allegations are laughable at the most. But I guarantee the moment his actions lead to something as devastating as *any* previous government in India, I will certainly stand up and criticize. Hold me accountable in case not.

What did you expect him to do ?

He took the country for a ride in that he implied that the only reason this country is fucked is because the previous govt had no fucking clue and some simple tweaks and fixes could turn the whole country into Gujarat. Eg: How they segregated the feeders etc.

He always has some simple mnemonic F2D2P2 , P2G2E2 and what not thats supposed fix all our woes. But that was just marketing. He doesn't have any magic wand. Gujarat is structurally much more sound which allows such reforms to happen. For eg the other day there was a story about how only 20 % of ppl in Mulayams constituency pay for power. Now if that's the way things roll in UP then making it powercut free could take more than a decade.

The govt is bankrupt and has very little room for adjustments. My only hope is that he is sincere and that after five years we will come out atleast a bit better.

My personal expectation is that they will make energy and drinking water top priorities and go after them full steam even at the cost of sidelining other issues. Get that Iran pipeline back on track , defeat China in bidding for overseas oil and aim to get Thorium reactors ready within a decade.

Fix energy and drinking water and all our other problems become much easier to fix. Without cheap and abundant energy nothings going anywhere.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cong-to-pack-courts-with-party-loyalists/articleshow/5733657.cms

&gt;Union law minister Veerappa Moily urged the AICC's legal department headed by Abhishek Singhvi to create a national database of lawyers affiliated with Congress. ''... we can form domain expertise using their experience; we can train them in different fields and ultimately bond them into mainstream of judiciary,'' he said. 

&gt;The call, with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the dais, led to murmurs in the gathering as it was interpreted that there will be a preference for lawyers affiliated with the Congress in the selection for judiciary. 

Remember the Abhisex scandal? Turns out the lawyer who gave him a blowjob(Anusuya Salwan) was actually recommended for the Delhi High Court by the collegium just as Singhvi had promised her. The then CJI had to intervene to reject the names proposed by the collegium.

http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/cji-sends-back-5-names-cleared-by-delhi-hc-collegium-for-judges/627667/

&gt;Chief Justice of India (CJI) S H Kapadia is learnt to have sent back names of five lawyers recommended for elevation as Judge by the Delhi High Court collegium.

&gt;The names had been recommended by the collegium of which the then Delhi High Court Chief Justice A P Shah was a member. In fact, the names had been recommended with just a few days left for Shah to retire.

...

&gt;Sources said apart from five lawyers — Abhinav Vasisht, Rajiv Virmani, **Anusuya Salwan**, Meenakshi Arora and Maninder Acharya — for elevation as judges, the HC collegium had also recommended the name of a District and Sessions judge for elevation to the HC Bench.

Controlling inflation is intimately related to controlling the fiscal deficit. People who disagree are ignoring fairly basic macro economics.

Further, you must also consider the scenario had Modi not been running the show. The ruppee/dollar exchange rate went from 67 to less than 60, simply because Modi was elected. This reduced the oil import bill by more than 10%. Had Modi not been there, any other govt. would have been doing the same thing, but the increase in prices would have been a lot larger.

102,"Nonsense.  Geographical and cultural contiguity do not a nation make.  Apart from the fairly dynamic borders they shared, all Indian kingdoms were, for the most part, autonomous and independent -- even when there was a hegemonic power calling the shots or extracting tribute.  

For example, even while the Chalukyas controlled pretty much all of Deccan at the peak of their glory; and Pulikeshi even defeated 'northie' Harshavardhana; the core of the Kannada empires remained what is Karnataka today.  More or less.  Same with Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Punjabi, Rajasthani.... kingdoms.  

To be sure, all these peoples of yore were aware of the geographical extent and natural boundaries of the sub-continent.  But that is simply the same as modern nations being aware of sub-continents and continents.  Modern discourse might refer to hegemonic influence of the United States all over the world or of Russia in Europe or India in the sub-continent, but taking that to suggest that the whole world is the United States of America is specious.

It is only the advent of the colonial powers that saw these borders being erased or rendered irrelevant.  The colonial powers couldn't care less for the borders of Vijayanagara or Marathas.  They just wanted to maximize profits and set upon rendering these borders irrelevant.  By hook or crook.

To imagine and reiterate an Indian nationhood for all its recorded history is simply wishful thinking at best and malicious revisionism at worst.  This is the kind of wishful 'unity in diversity' that Tito shoved down Yugoslavia's throat only for it to violently disintegrate in less than a decade after he passed.  And Tito was hailed as a great statesman in his time.  The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) that our textbooks passed off as Nehru's brainchild was actually Tito's and one that he executed against all odds.  Barely couple of decades after his passing, the same people of former Yugoslavia who worshiped Tito are now almost unanimous in the view that he did a great disservice by holding an artificial nation together.  Milosevic is demonized today, but history may well remember him as a victim of circumstances and the guy who had to do the dirty job.

Fortunately or unfortunately for India, the Republic of India was less beholden to a strongman and founded more on democratic principles instead of some variant of Communism and therefore, we survive and hobble along as one nation.  There is bound to be a spark that will blindside us and cause this fantasy to unravel.  Another 10 years of Congress rule and we would perhaps have been witness to it in our lifetimes.  Modi at the helm may hold it off for a couple more decades.  If there is any real development, that is.  But given the advent of social media, it will require less and less of a spark for things to go south.  

""Republic of India is just like Europe, but one country"" will remain the most reasonable approximation of what came of an accident of history, that was the 15th of Aug, 1947.

I know you are talking about the vote counts. Were these vote counts of the comments? If yes, **HOW** are you able to see these?

&gt; As for BJP's hypocrisy, I am not disagreeing with your assertion that BJP is behaving like a hypocrite. 

Thanks, that was my point.

&gt; My question was more along the lines of ""Ok they may be, so does that make BJP a bad choice for the govt when compared to Congress?"". To be frank, I am under no illusions that Congress will take a higher road when it is put in the same situation. So the question of whether an opposition party criticizes good govt. decisions and panders to populist slogans plays little role in choosing who to vote for(especially when their actions didn't lead to the cancellation of said good decisions). BJP was the better choice in the last elections simply because their PM candidate was better than Congress's PM candidate and because Congress ruined it's reputation with all the corruption scandals.


Hang on there. If we have to wait to *judge* before being  critical, you can wait before passing that BJP &gt; Congress. Works both ways.

Good roads and efficient handling of money are to be appreciated but I would really love for the PM to do the following things to reduce economic disparity:

1. Make banking services accessible to the poorest sections of society and completely break the monopoly that private small time loan-sharks have on the underprivileged sections of society. This will do a lot more for the growth of poor people than 10 big investment projects put together.

2. Put more money into research organizations throughout the country in various fields. Esp in energy generation, distribution, water and ecology. 

3. Create more transparency in big private projects and come up with some solution to the land mafia issue. Everyone is fighting for a piece of land and there must be a more elegant solution than to let the mafia and goondas set terms for everyone.

He also accuses the opposition ""people's party"" of having a setup with the current government.
  
He laments over the hopelessness of innocent people and questions as to what good the current government has done over one whole year, while in comparison to the statement given out by 30 days of Narendra Modi's governance. He goes on to state that if good job is done by a friend it should make you happy but if it is done by an enemy, it should instil a sense of competition due to precaution. He says Pakistani government is not effected either ways.
  
He appreciates that the revolutionary victory of new govt in india was well received by opposition (who did not cry foul). He asks for pakistani insight into Modi's first cabinet meeting for a source of inspiration. He calls out the apparent corruption-free nature of bjp's top leaders citing their willingness to investigate and bring back black money stocked up in foreign banks.
  
He goes on to cite many policy decisions (along with their dates) taken by PM Modi, which prove his govts efficiency, finally questioning the reader to show even one example of progressive behaviour (such as asking to get back black money) by the counterpart pakistani govt.

Suppose you are buying rice, and if at Thailand walmart rice is cheaper than it is at local produce walmart will kick its local farmer and go get it from thailand.

Repeat this for mangoes, apples,etc.
This isnt it, a lot of stuff it sells like clothes, shampoo is cheaper in walmart than in any store.
For example, a canadian local store sells Coke for 5 bucks wherelse walmart sells it for 3bucks. 

Walmart and retail companies are known to reckt the local market.
I don't know what AAP wants, 
but this is what BJP think is better for India: 

Investment in Local warehouses, Cold Storage should come from Local players thereby helping the farmer. Then we can allow Walmart or anyone to come in, and in case our local produce will be cheaper since we  have the infra instead of asking walmart to make it, or walmart importing wheat, Since we have optimised our farmers.

This is what happens in America, No farmers are dying . Wherelese in India, every hour farmers are dying due to lack of infra which can neither be given to walmart to develop since if they do they will monopolise it. 

This is what Modi did in Gujurat, He gave farmers loan to make drip irrigation, electricity, borewel,etc 

This ensures that when Walmart or anyone comes we have the infra such that its cheaper for them to buy local.

&gt; ""Hindus who had fled the Kashmir valley in the 1990s in the wake of popular uprisings and an armed struggle for a separate state – ""

So the Guardian calls systematic mass murders, mass rapes, genocide and terrorism (all aimed at a religious minority) as 'popular uprisings and an armed struggle for a separate state' and nothing more.

&gt;... are to be returned to their ""ancestors' land"" and ...

The use of ""ancestor's land"" in quotes casting doubts on the veracity of the fact. FFS, this happened just 2 decades ago! And yet, the Guardian starts casting doubts on facts to establish a certain narrative.

And the greatest thing about this article is that the Guardian managed to find a brown skinned sepoy to do their bidding. I doubt any of this is Amrit Wilson's original thought. She's just telling what her White sahibs want to hear, only in an Indian accent so that her White sahibs can create an illusion of legitimacy for their narrative.

331,"&gt;The only patina of satisfaction from those comments is that there's an evening if scales - the rhetoric from pre elections is coming back to bite people who didn't look at the issues and just raised a ruckus based on partisanship.

Which is incorrect. Now I was never a fan of the UPA or Congress, but even I did not find fault with their policies till towards the end of their first term. Certainly not in the first 60 days.

All these folks who say ""u-turn"", ""BJP can't deliver"" etc should try and turn around their own household finances within a month and then tell us how it went. It simply cannot be done! Systemic change, uprooting 50 years of Congress type socialism and work culture have resulted in India being the number 170 in 189 countries in the ease of doing business survey. It has a lower farm yield, lower parcel size and higher hiden unemployment than even Bangladesh. The entire agricultural sector is moribund and close to the death, the once robust manufacturing sector is in the same state. 10 years of fiscal profligacy is also a huge burden to pick up with.

The sad part is, it seems like (this sub only, in general there is a lot of hope and optimism) a lot of the negative people in this sub would love for the BJP to fail and for BJP to fail, not realising that it would be disastrous for India and Indians as a whole. Mind you, I am not saying Modi or the government is or should be above criticism, but it should be timely and fact based and not just nitpicking, and especially not 60 days into a 5 year tenure.

About the rhetoric, even Modi clarified it in the interview with Arnab, election rhetoric is one thing, governance is yet another. One cannot win an election campaign by talking about Fiscal deficit, brought forward expenses, failure of the 2 track diplomacy process etc. One needs to say stuff like Shezade, Rajmata, Maut Ka Saudagar, feeding Biryani etc. Poll time rhetoric is just that, poll time rhetoric, to look at the promises, one should go by the manifesto and hold them accountable.

I am for the first time, losing interest in political discussions in this sub because every single thing is spun as a “failure to Modi” or “rise of communal forces”.

&gt; Let's see what the budget holds. Whether there's genius in this govt will revolve around how shorn of buzzwords and how detail oriented the reform is.
If there's giving off of govt companies, what the long term plan? We are t in 1991 anymore and the business ecosystem has developed experienced predators. 
I don't want the released firms just absorbed and they being relegated to a footnote in the story of the deficit.

Precisely this! Let us at least wait for the first budget (though it is only for 9 odd months and the damage has already been done in the interim budget) and base our harsh judgements on facts.

I do have a different view on the privatization though. As long as the process is transparent, as long as it fetches the government the best price, I would say hiving these off to whoever pays the best price is the best thing the government can do. A lot of white elephants need to go, and if a private sector firm (even if it is something as predatory as Reliance)  is willing to pay the price…more power to them.

That is the thing which drove me to make that original comment.

The budget is like HL3 - the hype is so much, that no matter what, it will seem like a flop.

That being said, widening the tax net (only 3% of the population pays tax), massive disinvestment, and while dropping those useless schemes like MNREGA would be political suicide marrying these to asset creation would be good. Likewise a massive thrust (even if it is deficit financing) in the infrastructure domain (roads, ports and power) would help jumpstart the economy.

All this would only have a salutary effect, the true reform is legislative. Archaic labour laws, the CST, pushing states on reform by mapping performance with funds (no doles for the sake of votes) are all the crucial steps needed to build this country up.

Lastly, hope more funds are allocated to our defence, and purchases are sped up. The damn MMRCA tender was floated by the NDA in 2000! It is now 14 years and we are at least a year away from finalising the deal and 2 from getting the first planes. ",2014-07-07 15:56:34

Though, I must say, it is a lot better than the usual ""Hindu nationalist authoritarian right-winger Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu fundamentalist BJP"" crap this paper usually puts out about India. 

&gt;... the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a 48-nation body established 40 years ago to ensure that civilian trade in nuclear materials is not diverted for military purposes, as was done by India itself... [India's] application... should not be granted until India proves itself willing to take a leading role in halting the spread of the world’s most lethal weapons. One way to do that would be by opening negotiations with Pakistan and China to end the dangerous regional nuclear arms race... 

Opening negotiations with Pakistan and China? India has recently started expanding its nuclear program because the former two nations have been doing the same -- for years now! Had the writers taken a quick look at history, they'd come to understand that India has historically been the mature nuclear power with a strict no-first-use policy and a program under the strict control and guidance of democratic institutions. Can the same be said of authoritarian China and the ""army with a country"" Pakistan?

&gt;It has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which commits all states (except the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China) to forsake nuclear weapons.

Again, no perspective. India has always valued strategic independence. We're talking about a country with a painful experience with colonialism and foreign control over its military/financial policies. Why on earth, then, would it sign a treaty that would exclude itself from nuclear weapons when dying powers - France and the UK - and threatening neighbors - China - are given a free chit? India for God's sake fought a war with China in '62 and has since had constant border troubles. It isn't sacrificing its potential to counter its own damn neighbors. Why, furthermore, is a rising power and 1.2 billion's motherland being held down to a Cold War-era treaty meant to basically push all non-core nations in the 2nd and 3rd worlds to join the umbrella of either the west or USSR?

&gt;President George W. Bush was so eager to use the agreement as the centerpiece of a new India-America relationship that he cut a weak deal. India did not have to limit its nuclear weapons, stop producing bomb-making material or forsake nuclear testing. Even India’s promise that American business would benefit from nuclear technology contracts has not been fulfilled because of an Indian liability law that imposes hefty financial responsibility on contractors if there is an accident.

Obligatory ripping on a GOP President- classic NYTimes hallmark. First and foremost, the Indo-US Nuclear Deal was considered a huge success by all parties. It was the first time in, well, forever that the US and India was able to sit down and comprehensively work out a deal on an issue that had deep strategic and domestic concerns for India. Not to mention the fact that keeping companies responsible for their actions is a policy that's not only socially optimal, but inline with natural laws of a well function free market economy.

&gt;According to IHS Jane’s, a defense research group, India is expanding a uranium enrichment plant that could support the development of nuclear bombs. That is sure to make Pakistan, which has the world’s fastest growing nuclear arsenal, more anxious than ever. India is believed to have 90-110 nuclear weapons; Pakistan, about 100-120; and China, about 250.

Making Pakistan anxious?!?! It's not like Pakistan has been rapidly expanding its arsenal for years now- well before India's recent (and retaliatory) buildup. Not sure why China is mentioned at all, as its nuclear program is the oldest and most expansive of all three and free even under the stipulations of the beloved NPT to, without repercussion, build up its arsenal to its preference.

**Aam Aadmi Party Reaction on Rail Budget:**
*The AAP is of the view that the first rail budget of the BJP-led NDA government turned out to be a missed opportunity. The Narendra Modi government could have used its maiden rail budget to spell out its long term vision for the improvement of the health of railways, but it is unfortunately missing.
The people of the county had expected that the new government to lay down its roadmap to improve the efficiency of the railways by curbing the price distortion and corruption, two major problems currently plaguing this critical sector, but the budget appears to be silent on addressing these long term concerns and belies expectations of a long term vision.
There is nothing concrete in this budget on the improvement of safety and maintenance of the massive railway network across the country. Nearly 2.5 lakh posts are lying vacant in the railways and out of these 1.6 lakh posts are in departments directly concerned with the railways safety, but nothing has been done to fill up these posts.
The common man (aam aadmi) forms the bulk of railway passenger traffic, but the focus on such passengers is missing. Infact, the focus of the budget provides a reason for alarm in this aspect – the trend in the budget is to focus on the upper class of commuters, whose number is miniscule in terms of passenger traffic.
Facilities should be provided to all categories of passengers, but the focus on those who can spend more for facilities does not set a healthy trend.
The railways minister has made an honest confession about the large number of pending projects. The AAP agrees with the government that the focus should be on execution of existing projects, but in this respect too, the minister did not mention any roadmap on how the government plans to complete the job.
The AAP, in principle, does not oppose Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in railways, but the minister’s announcement did not specify in which field does the NDA government propose to invite the FDI. The impression created is that the government is ready to go ahead with the FDI in all fields, except in operations. There are many sensitive sectors in Railways, like the one handling the spectrum that cannot be opened to foreign investors.
The hurry to attract FDI in Railways could create a dangerous situation and the government should hold widespread consultations before going ahead with the introduction of FDI in railways.
The thrust on implementing the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model in railways is a dangerous trend. The concept of PPP model so far in the country has been that the public sector bears the risk and the private sector walks away with profit, such a model can spell disaster for the railways.
The AAP does not agree with the minister’s announcement about the proposal to restructure the Railway Board. It is one of the rare board/corporation in the government sector which is not controlled by the IAS officers, and is run by professionals.
Unless the government clearly specifies what kind of restructuring it wants, the announcement appears to be an attempt to undermine the Board’s autonomy. Restructuring for improving the fiscal health of railways and bringing professionalism is welcome, but it cannot be allowed to become ministry Vs board fight.
The Aam Aadmi Party also sees a regional imbalance in announcement of new train services. A government cannot ignore the requirements of one region appease the other.

398,"&gt; in essence, there was no punishment for the parliament attack (which lead to the operation) . I think people out of thirst for revenge deemed the operation useless.

Partly this was a result of the NDA govt. being hoisted by its own petard. After all their tough rhetoric, 'aar paar ki ladai', we did not see Indian tanks in Pakistani chowks. :-) 

But at the end of the day, Pakistan suffered brutally. There were two serious attempts on the life of Musharraf by Jihadis frustrated at Pak Mil withdrawing their support for the Kashmir jihad. This was the start of the time when Pakistan was torn into two warring factions of the pure and the even more pure, when earlier it was the pure (Pak) against the impure (India).

Think about it, it was as if the BJP govt. was being forced to put RSS leaders in jail, ban their organizations, shoot some of the more extreme members and so on.

Then there were the artillery duels fought on the LoC. This was so intense, that the entire Neelam valley in Pakistan had to be evacuated of all Civil population. 

Another important benefit from Op Parakram was the political space it opened up in Kashmir. Its a different matter that the UPA govt. did not make any use of it.. 

&gt; But I guess now that India has deployed more sophisticated technology, we wouldn't witness another ""build up"" persay.

The thresholds and the expectations of Indian people have also changed since Op Parakram. So if there is another serious transgression like Mumbai (as there will be), you can expect Pak to suffer from consequences. I am not sure what these will be under the Modi govt. but there will be consequences, of that, I am certain. ",2014-07-09 07:20:54
399,"&gt;I wish they had been a good opposition, the last 10 years would have been so much better.

Nonsense. They were a bad opposition indeed, but that is where their fault ends. It is the job of the ruling party to run the govt. The Congress is not to blame for the mistakes of the ABV or Modi govts, and by the same token the BJP is not to blame for the UPA's misrule.

How about applying a little of that self awareness to this topic and realizing how dumb you sound?

The UPA never even made any effort at all on black money. They opposed and stymied the probe when the Supreme Court called for it.

The NDA removed the objection and got on board on day 1. They are actually following up with Swiss authorities and extracting whatever information they can under international agreements. And considering two former Supreme Court judges are heading the investigation you can't even say it's a political cover-up game or else they'd have noticed it by now.

It is probable that there are many BJP guys who have undisclosed Swiss Bank holdings. I would guess that it is nowhere as large as with the Congress guys, but it is enough to make it difficult for Modi. The hope I have with the man is because he is clearly a long term thinker, what is in management called a strong operations man, and of course politically astute. So I would give him more time. He seems to be be beginning modestly, and playing a game of Go, slowly accumulating positions.

It is an interesting situation for Modi. The man is squeaky clean. He has inherited a scorched earth by the previous government which was determined to leave a smoking rubble, e.g. Chidambaram having blown much of the budget for the year already.

439,"Most people did not know the actual figures but they knew exactly how much the government had fucked up in the last 5 years and important it was to have a change in government. I remember my dad- a strong leftist who took part in commie movements in his youth- actually sitting me down and telling me in no uncertain words how important it was to vote for Modi (because he suspected I would not vote for him due their religious and social stance) and that it would be the biggest disaster in the history of the country for Congress to win or NDA to not get a majority. He hadn't even tried to influence my vote when I was voting for the 1st time in my teens.  

There is a reason why they got such a huge number of votes and such an unprecendented majority. People, even the ones that did not like their political or social leanings came out in droves and voted for them because they knew it was more important to have a progressive and accomplished administrator in office. They were literally scared to give votes to other parties in case Modi somehow didn't get into office- that's why even unpopular parties like SS and SAD won so many seats. 

The important thing here is it wasn't the BJP faithful that won Modi the election- there aren't nearly enough of them- it was him convincing the neutrals and even the faithful of the other parties like congress, BSP, SP and so on to do what they had never done and support him. That's why so many of the BJP MPs didn't just get the most votes in their constituencies, they actually got the majority of the votes. 

And that's going to be his biggest challenge by the time 2019 comes around, to keep all these non and anti BJP people on his side. That's why you see so much critiscism, its from all these guys wondering if they actually did the right thing in voting for him and projecting their guilt into anger at him. They couldn't do it in 2004 which is why they lost despite Congress not even having a defined plank.

He took power in 2001, in his first term, he put in place the systemic changes, the macro economy became robust by around 2008. Agriculture has been growing at a 10% clip only for the past 5 years, but the money to bring in social changes came in only by 2012.

Watch Anandiben do with Gujarat's social sector what Modi did with the economics, but change in the HDI factors will take another 5-10 years!

So essentially full change in all parameters would be visible only by 2020 - 19 years after the reforms began.

* /u/march_of_idles - ""We will overshoot the budget and realise public donations won't cover the whole thing. At some point it will become too big for the central government to not get involved, and regardless of which party is in power, they will end up chipping in too.

How is it that only when it comes to Nitin Gadkari or Amit Shah or Modi is no evidence found and courts don't find them guilty...yet this lack of guilt is twisted as the courts being purchased or bullied which is simply not the case.

Either one has evidence of wrong doing and proves it in a court, or one needs to stfu about clean chits. Think about it, ultimate fixers and billionaires like Subroto Ray, stars like Sanjay Dutt have had the rule book thrown at them.

The problem with the Indian legal system is at the police level, once evidence is gathered, the courts usually function without fear.

""To provide the necessary focus to this critical activity, I have provided a sum of Rs.7,060 crore in the current fiscal,"" Jaitley said.*

So 7060 cr has been allotted as the first step towards modernizing and building these 100 smart cities as satellites and auxiliaries of existing urban centers all over India.

490,"No, today you learned that **Congress-controlled CBI alleged** that Amit Shah and Sohrabuddin Sheikh ran an extortion ring together.

The evidence cited by CBI was the statement of Patel brothers - two notorious builders with criminal cases against them since 2001 (five years before the encounters). One of the Patel brothers was contacted by police officers who allegedly extorted money from them, in name of Amit Shah. They made him talk with a person over phone. The builder says that the voice was that of Amit Shah. He never personally talked to Amit Shah about any sort of extortion money.

What role do these builders play in the encounter case? This is how it went according to the CBI.

* Amit Shah ran an extortion racket with Sohrabuddin and Tulsiram as his henchmen.
* Sohrabuddin was harassing a bunch of marble traders in Rajasthan with hefty protection money.
* These marble traders gave Sohrabuddin's supari to Amit Shah.
* Amit Shah ordered his police officers to get Sohrabuddin killed.
* He asked Tulsiram to organize a fake attack on the builders' office in name of Sohrabuddin, to register a case against the latter.
* Then, he asked Gujarat police to arrest Sohrabuddin.
* Sohrabuddin was arrested. His wife and Tulsiram, who were traveling with him, were also arrested.
* The couple were killed, but Tulsiram was spared as Amit Shah still needed him for doing the henchman job. He was later killed when he threatened to spill the beans.

CBI won't tell you why Amit Shah decided to get rid of Sohrabuddin instead of simply asking him to extort money from some place other than Rajasthan. They just speculate that Sohrabuddin might have known about some other misdeeds of Amit Shah.  CBI won't tell you how Congress government, which ruled Rajasthan at the time, could not stop Amit Shah's extortion racket there. CBI won't tell you why Amit Shah needed to organize an attack on the builders' office in name of Sohrabuddin to register a case against Sohrabuddin - the latter already had multiple criminal cases against him in three states: Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. CBI won't tell you why this attack was organized in 2004, **one year before** the encounter of Sohrabuddin.

The truth is CBI had zero evidence against Amit Shah. They connected the attack on the builders' office with the encounters, because this was the only evidence against Amit Shah. The other ""evidence"" - such as Amit Shah's call with police officers was laughable, because Amit Shah's call records showed that he was in touch with these police officers all the time - not just during the encounter. He was the Home Minister, and it was part of his job to be in contact with the police officers.

Congress wanted to drag Amit Shah's name to malign Narendra Modi - their biggest problem for the 2014 elections. The case was uncovered in **2007**. Congress ruled India for the next 6 years. It could have easily got Amit Shah convicted, if they had any solid evidence whatsoever.

It's just pathetic how 58% of the readers have upvoted this nonsense. Don't complain when people call you ""AAPTards"". You fully deserve it. You people think that everyone else is brainwashed by propaganda and you're the most enlightened folks in India. In reality, you guys are nothing more than a bunch of naive fellows easily fooled by propaganda and still butthurt about losing the elections.

While this budget is good, and I trust Modi to work sincerely on the implementation, the MinGMaxG idea is missing here. Government is spending lot of energy is reviving companies which went in red in UPA regime (BSNL, Air India). What I fear is UPA will fuck them again and as a tax payer we again will pay for that. Plan should be something else and not just **better honest efficient implementation**

Indian police (state subject I know), judiciary etc are one of most fucked up organisations and sadly can't be replaced by private organisations. If news reports are believed to be true, if our defence is not modernised we can lose our edge to Pakistan in 10-15 years.
