16,"&gt; ***It is understood that KCR has proposed an informal tie up between the TRS and BJP at the national level and promised support to the BJP bid for the next government.***

&gt; Unwilling to be caught in the midst of a national election where different issues would dominate, Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has decided to advance polls to the state assembly and has recommended dissolution of Telangana assembly about six months in advance.

&gt; From appearances it is also very clear that KCR has kept Prime Minister Narendra Modi (who he has met twice in the last two months) in the loop.

&gt; .... After announcement of the proposal for an election, KCR has gone ballistic against the Congress and has made none too complimentary references to the party president Rahul Gandhi. This is possibly to make his preferences clear to the BJP bosses.

&gt; ... For starters, KCR who rules the state with an iron hand in the manner of feudal lord seems to have a clear lead over the opposition. Although KCR has announced his candidates for the majority of the seats for the polls (including his own), analysts believe that he would migrate to national politics shortly leaving the chief minister’s position to his son K Taraka Rama Rao (KTR).",2018-09-08 11:58:39

18,This is a result of typical Indian mentality idiots like Tharoor thought india could overcome China using soft power. Modi is just a long line of people who have made blunders in foreign policy but this has been a theme since 25 years.  Indians think that when you have a potential ally it's ok to treat them like the little step child when things are going your way.  No the only chance you have to win with soft power is to treat the lesser ally with a little more decency when times are good.  This will ensure loyalty in bad times.  Instead the Indian mentality is to be dismissive and to hold power games when things are good and going your way and then wonder what happened when someone else stole away your limelight. ,2018-09-08 14:48:53

India deserves better opposition than Rahul Gandhi who thinks position of PM is his birth right or Kejriwal who is populist and failed to come up with long term policies most of the time.

21,"Chinese influence has been increasing steadily all across South Asia and Central Asia for decades. It's actively competing with Russia and beating it now in many Central Asian Countries for example. 

With respect to Nepal, a country sandwiched between two great powers, it is in in their interest to be friendly towards both and get the maximum out of the relationship. Nepal has also been the site of great political activity over the last few decades from Maoists and Communists fighting with the state to eventually assuming power through elections. Granted, Chinese haven't been that interested in openly supporting Maoists per se in Nepal at the cost of stability which affects the neighbouring Tibet, but these things do have an influence over political orientation of the people and country in the longer term. There is also the issue of Madhesh and allegations of Indian interference. Big-brotherly attitude of India towards Nepal is also something which irks many Nepalese.

These things don't look good on PM Modi because his foreign policy is bigged up by his party and supporters, but in reality it goes much deeper than that. These things don't happen over a few years, but foreign policy decisions over many years straddling multiple governments lead to this. The recent experiences with blockade in 2015 also plays a role because being a landlocked country, it doesn't want to put all it's eggs in one basket. ",2018-09-08 17:58:29

26,"Are you the personification of "" Blame Nehru^TM "" 

&gt;Maldives political crisis started with the coup in 2012. All this happened under Congress. The new government was pro-China and viewed India as a treat from the get go.

Maldivies turning against india happen under the time of narendra, congress was the one who made maldives a pro-indian country on the other hand. Their could be countless measures that could be taken to avoid the current situation.

&gt;Sri Lanka - Again, the port was built when Congress was in charge. Our relations with sri Lanka have been down since we put india. Soldiers there post Tamil resolution. The LTTE cleanup was during Congress tenure. What do you want us to do? Buy the insolvent port?

This is far away from reality, during the last 4 years china freely turned SL against india, It was expected of india to struck deals with SL so that they can pay china off or keep china away but on the contrary Narednra did absolutely nothing, china is on the verge of converting SL into it's colony.

&gt;Russia - India and Russia are eventually going to clash. Russia is Indian politician cash cow for corruption. With Crimea, Russians are now fully with China. Now, with the US election fiasco. Russia is done. Come mid terms in US, Putin is a dead man walking.

I love the confirmation bias in your comment, like everybody else is stupid too understand anything. The whole relationship between india and russia is due to congress the country should be thankful to congress rule to somehow achieve that.

**Russia going against india and supplying weapons to Pak was direct response of Narendra siding with US.**  Thats the part you forgot to mention.

&gt;Iran - under Congress we back stabbed them for civil nuclear agreement. Under BJP we decided to reduce oil imports. You tell me a better plan that BJPs. We are still getting the port.

Congress was the one to establish alliance with iran on the first place , Chabahar port was congress idea, saying it an idea would be downplaying it was a strategical success from their part, what narendra did? almost got the port away from india, and due to india's anti-muslim stance Iran asked china and pak to be part of the port too, Our diplomacy in last 4 years was a historical failure.

&gt;Bhutan - there is heavy Chinese propaganda there. Nationalism will make Bhutanese get a bad deal for themselves and us. Just look at US, UK, Italy, and see what nationalism gives you. What do you want us to do there, give China a free hand?

Wow you so conveniently forgot the jumlas of Mr.FEKU, didn't modi government said they hit the masterstroke and scared china away, doklam is safe? whereas in reality china was building helipads. 

&gt;Nepal - This is definitely all BJP. But Congress did the same before and relations somewhat recover. India is being used for false nationalism. Nepal cannot survive without us and they have to come to terms with that themselves. Let's not forget, Nepal benefits a lot from trade with India, China doesn't even buy most of their stuff.

Last friday, MNS people went to railway station in Dadar to evict illegal hawkers (which pay bribes to BJP despite an SC ruling against them). The hawkers ran away as soon as they saw MNS flags! MNS people then handed them over to the police. Did they beat anyone up? No. They had done so six months ago, now the fear is enough. Go to Dadar, MNS leader had made the contractor stand in a pothole in front of the media holding a plaque ""I built this pothole"", the same day he made the chief engineer in BMC stand in a pothole holding the same plaque. One year later, look at the roads of Dadar (or at least the leader says so, I haven't gone there recently so can't vouch for the authenticity)

&gt; Given this ubiquitousness, it is likely that the recent ‘Mood of the Nation Survey’ by India Today, which shows that his popularity has dropped from 53% in January 2018 to 49% in July 2018, will have rung alarm bells for the BJP’s star strategists – party president Amit Shah and of course, Modi himself.

&gt; If the trends from an aggregated average of vote shares from the bypolls held across the country post December 2017 hold true, the UPA along with the BSP and the SP would get a 45.3% vote share. In comparison, the NDA would only get 36% of the vote – and if the UPA went it alone, they would only garner 32%.

Treatment of Tibetian. You can pull up the HRW article on it. 

&gt;Chinese version of Constitution? Lower states? What's a Chinese version? Lol. Nepal is smaller than the state of Bihar, it's best that we try to keep the no of provinces to a minimum, 7 is still a lot for a small country. We still have proportional representation. This point was a lot to process lol, what do you eat for breakfast, conspiracy?

Two lies, one China wanted 7 and india was pushing for 11 based on ethnic lines. Again, lying. There are seats that are reserved and the rest are proportional. The reserved seats skew the political power enough that people in the Terai region who form a majority population can only get 40% of the seats while being anywhere between 50-60% of the pppulation.

&gt;Choosing china"" ""blowback"", if you're pointing to the blockade. The blockade led to Nepal China relationship to strength more than anything ever did. And if you're supporting the blockade, god help you. Remember what happened when the Indian people were fed up with the british starving then? Lol Drop out prime minister? I'm not even going to stoop to your level and point out modi here.

False equivalence. British India ruled India. Nepal government rules Nepal. If India ruled Nepal your point would be valid. I do not support the blockade. I support tough actions. Reopen the freedom of movement treaty and job treaty for negotiations. Discontinue all Nepalese education programs that India supports. Let Nepalese apply for visas and job permits same as all foreigners. It's a much more subtle tactic. If Nepal wants to be in bed with China go ahead. Dont expect Indian relations to not sour. That's called diplomacy. You can't just have your cake and eat it too. It's a basic concept but seems nationalists like you dont get. Dont worry UK is heading the same way with Brexit.

Are you a child? Most terrorism requires money and financing. That requires movement of goods, money to finance operations. You have the understanding of a 5 year old.

139,"&gt; Oil again ? When the UPA heavily subsidised oil to appease the majorities and get vote

You really shouldn't be commenting on this issue if you don't understand the difference between *global crude oil* prices and subsidized fuel prices at the pump. My comment was about the fact that any govt that governs when our biggest import is at over 100/bbl automatically has a far harder job to manage the economy than a govt that deals with the same commodity at less than 80/bbl. This is regardless of what subsidy is applied on petrol/diésel.

My comment had nothing to do with prices at the pump because I actually do know the difference between crude and petrol/diesel.

Also, your criticism of the INC on the count of inflation etc is often valid - which is why I've never once voted for the INC. What I've said however is that Modi has had much easier circumstances than the previous govt did. Ask any economist whether the global economy was better in 2008 or now.

270,"&gt; Hindu nationalists have adopted Patel, who was born Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, as an icon.  

The same man who banned the RSS and thought this - 

Patel wrote to Jawahar L. Nehru on Feb 27, 1948 after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.

&gt; “His assassination was welcomed by those of the RSS and the Mahasabha who were strongly opposed to his way of thinking...But beyond this, I do not think it is possible…to implicate any other members of the RSS or the Hindu Mahasabha. The RSS have other sins and crimes to answer for, but not this one.”

&gt;Sardar Patel had attacked the RSS in Jaipur:

&gt; “We will not allow the RSS or any other communal organisation to throw the country back on the path of slavery or disintegration … I am a soldier, and in my time I have fought against formidable forces … If I feel that such a fight is necessitated for the country’s good, I shall not hesitate to fight even my own son.”

Wow. These people really have no dignity.


&gt; Modi claimes – wrongly, according to historians – that the disputed region of Kashmir would have been fully Indian had Patel become leader.

&gt; There is now enough circumstantial evidence pointing to the Modi government’s culpability in letting bank defaulter Vijay Mallya leave the country. Lawyer Dushyant Dave’s statement that he had clearly advised his client State Bank of India to move court to stop Mallya leaving the country is the first substantial evidence pointing towards the Modi government’s culpability in Mallya’s dramatic escape from the country, after siphoning off hundreds of crores from the SBI.

&gt; Dave, a senior Supreme Court lawyer, had advised SBI four days before Mallya left the country to take legal action to stop the defaulting businessman from fleeing the country. Dave had told the SBI that it must approach the Supreme Court to put stop to Mallya’s plan to go abroad. The SBI did not heed his advice and Mallya left the country four days later.

&gt; ... Mallya left the country on March 2, 2016 while the SBI moved the Supreme Court in this regard only by March 5, 2106. Mallya was by that time comfortably settled in London. 

&gt; ... Another evidence pointing to the government’s complicity in Mallya’s escape is the role of the Central Bureau of Investigation. **It’s now in public domain that the CBI diluted it’s own Look-out Circular (LoC) in Mallya’s case. The CBI LoC circular against Mallya was issued to airports three years before Mallya left the country.

Cause what you've posted seems like fool's hope, and goes against everything this government has done, like Demonetization, GST, fudging the numbers via changing year etc.

&gt;BJP workers would want Modi to cut oil prices. It is a quick way to appease their vote bank [middle class] and help them win elections. Why would Modi want to piss off the common people and lose votes? So many businesses that fund the BJP rely on petrol/diesel and would not reducing prices help the BJP appease them and get more funding? Is keeping high petrol prices helping Modi/BJP in any way?

&gt;When governments try to subsidise petrol/diesel [like they did in the past], there is a huge cost to the government. Somebody has to pay for it. Either more taxes on something else or less government spending on social programs. And paradoxically by trying to control petrol price, you take on so much debt that the inflation shoots up.

If BJP could subsidize fuel prices, they absolutely would. But right now, we're already going to miss fiscal deficit target.^^1 Where will the money come from to subsidize fuel then? Add in the rising global crude oil prices and you'll know why it's difficult to cut prices via subsidizing OR cut subsidies and let the fuel prices go up even more. BJP's just stuck between a rock and a hard place and it terrifies me to even think what they'll do to get out of there.

Here's complete part of his speech. He's not talking about economics, but energy conservation and generation.

&gt;However, I would like the nation to remember that issuing bonds and loading deficits on oil companies is not a permanent solution to this problem. We are only passing on our burden to our children who will have to repay this debt. Cutting down on the returns of our oil companies will choke a sector vital for the growth of the economy. We need more corrective measures in future on many fronts. In the long term, our country must have a sound strategy for energy security.

&gt;To begin with, each one of us can conserve energy and contribute to national security. I urge every citizen to conserve energy at every step, every minute of the day. Be it petrol, diesel, kerosene, LPG, electricity or even water let us learn to save and use efficiently. Let us reduce wasteful consumption of petrol.

&gt;Finally, we have to develop alternative sources of energy, whatever be the source. We cannot remain captive to uncertain markets and unsure sources of supply. We have to develop renewable sources of energy, including nuclear energy.

&gt;My Fellow Citizens, today more and more of our people are enjoying the fruits of development. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure a secure future for all our people and for future generations. We cannot think only for ourselves, for the present, for the here and now. We must think about what is good for future generations - for the welfare and security of our children, grand children and their children. It is our duty to ensure their food security and energy security.

&gt;The steps taken today are part of that process. I hope each one of you will strengthen our hands in building a strong, secure and caring India. An India where the aam aadmi feels safe, secure and hopeful about the future.

But that also makes it easy to claim whatever you want when politically useful. And Modi is not the sort of person to shy away from doing things for political gain. My theory is that this was to give them some leeway if things go south.

Also they've not claimed the oil bonds thingy officially. My guess is that they don't do that because they might be laughed out of town by experts. This way they can placate their followers who won't do a simple Google search to see whether the claims make any sense.

These parties do not seem to have grasped the deeper pattern of interconnected trends unfolding behind the policy steps taken by the Modi administration with the encouragement of the ruling party.

They do seem several steps behind.

&gt;In recent months, the situation in the Kashmir Valley is at its inflamed worst, with the political process having collapsed as Governor’s Rule has been imposed. After the breakdown of the alliance with the PDP in June, the BJP has reverted to its traditionally hard-line position on the status of J&amp;K, questioning the special provisions designed to protect its conditional accession to the Union.

354,"&gt;The krishna sect/whatever she and her husband were (are?) part of in Hawaii has been accused of functioning in a cult-like manner by former members and the 'guruji' and inner circle are at the very least alleged to have covered up abuse if not been involved in it. I believe there's also some shady land deals they were involved in. Thanks for misquoting me, btw, I said she wasn't terrible but might have been involved or adjacent in some shady shit. 

Have been accused of ? Have any of them been charged of a crime let alone found guilty . Have any survivors spoken up about it ?  This Huffington post article critically examined it and  found no anomalies . Anonymous comments which are patently false ? 


https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6879588

I quote from the article .

&gt;Civil Beat found no evidence that Tulsi Gabbard is — or ever was — a Butler devotee. And we could find no record of her ever speaking publicly about it. Neither is her husband a Butler devotee .

Butler hasn't been accused of any crimes by the way or charged . There are anonymous comments on many forums but the Huffington Post in conjunction with Civil Beat examined them thoroughly .

So she isn't or wasn't  a part of a cult as you put it , Her parents were and calling an offshoot of a Krishna foundation a cult is being very disengenious.  Every  Protestant or Lutheran will be now called a member of a cult since it's an offshoot of the Catholic Church .

She doesn't follow a godman however you want to spin it . 




&gt;Fuck off dude. This isn't r/politics, this is r/india. I'm reasonable sure hundreds of people haven't been haranguing you about her because people don't talk about US politics on this sub. She has taken support from BJP/linked groups and spoken at Sangh parivar events before. She clearly doesn't want to be associated with the RSS in this case, but - at least in the past - she's been ok with the electoral face of the RSS.


She is proud to be a Hindu as I am sure billions of people are proud to be of their religion. She is a great supporter of India in US policy and was a supporter of Modi during 2014-15 (see here is a flaw in her that you can attack ) .


 Sangh parivar events are generally open in the sense that anyone can attend them. Moderate Hindus , Babas like Swami Agnivesh (who is attacked by Hindutvavadis nowadays )  people like Kumar Vishwas etc are regular attendees. I don't see the problem in that as it's an open platform .

What she has objected to in this instance is the name Word Hindu World Congress implies an open platform for anyone who is an Hindu to participate but in truth  95 % of speakers were from.the RSS and  Hindutvavadi zealots . She has criticised this specific instance 


&gt;Also, way to get het up about something irrelevant. The Congressman accused of knowledge of sexual abuse while he was a college boxer is also a decorated military veteran. Are you pissed off at people trying to assassinate his character too? Or are only the politicians you personally like infallible? Please note that in an effort to be circumspect I made it clear that I don't think she's terrible and she might have been adjacent to shady shit and not involved in it. But you might want to do your research.

Has she been accused of sexual harassment ?  Has she  ever tried to shield the accused from the law ?  What sort of analogy are you drawing with a Congressman who is personally accused of sexual abuse ? 

What you are essentially saying is this : 

When she was little (read a minor ) she may have visited a  temple many times   with her parents in which the head priest may or may not be running a cult and the said cult may or may not be involved in abuses. ( No complaints have been made and no one has been charged btw ) . 

After that the woman changed her views( started supporting gay marriage, LGBT rights etc in marked contrast to the religious Guru) became a military hero and endorsed Sanders ( Sanders didn't endorse her btw , another falsehood you spouted )  when every other superdelegate supported Hillary . 


Now answer honestly since you have made false equivalences after equivalences 

1. Can you prove  Tulsi Gabbard is a part of a cult ? 

2. Can you prove that she has aided or tried to shield  the organization headed by Chris Brunt in any way ? 

3. Can you prove abuses occurred by the  Hare Krishnas in Hawaii ?

4 . Has any victim come forward ?

Here is another fairly critical long read about Tulsi Gabbard  and no where does it mention any abuse allegations about  Chris Brunt . 

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/06/what-does-tulsi-gabbard-believe

Like I said you are trying to tarnish her reputation    just because you feel like it.  She has many problems primarily among them her support of Modi initially but she isn't involved in some shady shit like you seem to imply and then abuse anyone if you are called out on it  .

The link had it. It's installments for a few years. Can't remember.

&gt;But how do we prove it was a failure by numbers ?

There are enough reports about it and articles too. 

The first aid of Demonetization was to get a massive profit because not everyone would be able to return their notes, or so Modi thought. That failed when 99.3% of notes returned.

Then it would be about widening the tax base. There hasn't been a significant increase in that either, 14% is par for the course.

Terror funding. Violence in Kashmir is cyclical based on the weather. There's very little activity during winter months because the terrain is extra gnarly then. So we heard nothing from Nov 2016 for a few months but things would have reverted in the in the summer.

Fake notes. Now there are reports of fake currency returning.

Hoarding notes under the bed. Only bhakhts think that black money is mainly hidden under the bed; it tends to be invested elsewhere actually. Even otherwise, nothing stops people from hoarding cash under the bed now and bringing back a 2k note after railing about large denominations is absurd.

There has been massive loses to local industry from demonetization. You'll find many reports about that.

Digital India. It's what they pivoted to after it looked like their initial rhetoric failed. There seems to be an improvement of sorts, but nothing that would justify something as massive as Demonetization. They could've easily found other ways to encourage digital transactions.

I'm sure there are more and cleverer people than me have written about it. But I don't think these facts would convince the bhakhts. They're at the point where good intentions (saaf Niyat) is enough and results jaaye bhaad mein.",2018-09-17 11:58:43

378,"&gt; Many of them are becoming a big liability for the saffron party in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But **they are the ones who were gifted their chairs by the Modi-Amit Shah ‘jodi’ as rewards for loyalty, friendship or considerations other than their administrative or political acumen.**

&gt; ... Take the case of **Manohar Lal Khattar, the chief minister of Haryana**, whose appointment to the post in October 2014 got everyone curious about this first-time MLA. As it turned out, he was a **close friend of Modi** when they were Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) pracharaks –and his khichdi was the Gujarat leader’s favourite ... Four years on, **Haryana has emerged as, to mention a few, the most unsafe place for women and a land of violent caste conflicts and shady, criminal babas** with politicians at their feet and the state police in obeisance.

&gt; ... In **Jharkhand, Raghubar Das was picked up as the chief minister as per Modi-Shah’s** strategy to mobilise an assortment of non-influential communities to outnumber the dominant one in different states ... The Das government has been courting controversies right from the start. The state has witnessed a spate of mob lynching incidents even as the BJP regime has had tribals up in arms against the domicile policy, amendments in tenancy bills, anti-conversion law, et al. The chief minister is now under attack from his own party colleagues ... A majority of BJP MPs and MLAs are protesting against the government’s move to merge primary and middle schools ... 

&gt; ... In **Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath may have pleased the Sangh Parivar** by consistently displaying his commitment to a polarising agenda, but his dismal show on development front may make matters worse for the BJP in 2019 ... With Adityanath in the saddle for barely 18 months, **UP has primarily been known for cow vigilantism, ban on ‘illegal’ slaughterhouses, death of scores of children in a Gorakhpur hospital, allegations by BJP leaders of neglecting Dalits, jail shootouts, fake encounters allegedly of criminals belonging to particular castes and political affiliations, harassment by anti-Romeo squads, and so on.**

&gt; ... **Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis got praise from Amit Shah** at the party’s national executive earlier this month for his government’s crackdown on ‘Urban Naxals’ ... But **the Brahmin chief minister has left the BJP in a cleft stick, with both Dalits and Marathas, who together constitute nearly half of the state’s population, on the agitation path.** He has not been able to rein in coalition partner Shiv Sena or motormouths in his own party. Recently, BJP MLA Ram Kadam allegedly promised to help boys in kidnapping girls if they spurn their suitors, causing a huge embarrassment to the party ...

&gt; ... **Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s** 18-month tenure is forgettable at best. Dehradun is abuzz with anecdotes and stories about the **corrupt practices of many of Rawat’s close aides.**

&gt; ... After courting many controversies with his utterances, **Tripura’s young chief minister, Biplab Deb, finally got one thing right: that ducks raise oxygen level in water bodies.**

&gt; There are many other BJP chief ministers with similar track records. The question here is: **if everyone can see how they could dent the BJP’s prospects in 2019 elections, why is Modi or Shah bearing with them?**

&gt; Party insiders offer two explanations. **First, Modi and Shah can be or can’t be seen wrong about their choices. Second, it’s Modi**, and not some provincial heads, **who will determine the course of the next elections and so, let them be as long as they remain their master’s voice.**

386,"Well, i would say that leading upto the 2019 election we are gonna see stiff state election battles, rajasthan cycles its govt and both Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are looking at 3 terms of BJP anti incumbency. So expect Congress to do well in these three states, this will definitely give a boost to congress in the 2019 lok sabha polls. Telangana is gonna be a KCR winning as he has done a lot, but expect more seats for Congress as it is the principal opposition there. 

Now if in the above states Congress puts up a good show and wins Rajasthan and M.P or Chattisgarh, we will see a whole lot of parties running up to UPA.

In Lok Sabh elections 2019:

SP-BSP-Congress tie up will be help them in UP (like they did for by-polls and were highly successful since they won the CM and Deputy CM seats), 
RJD-Congress could do well in Bihar, 
TMC will do well in West Bengal, MP-Chattisgarh-Rajasthan will pivot towards Congress aswell (anti incumbency vote), 
DMK will probably do a lot well in Tamil Nadu since AIADMK isnt in a good position.
Left will do well in Kerala. 
Karnataka suggested by its municpal polls recently will have a tight contest but can see the same status quo it has currently so this will favour the Congress-JDS alliance,
Andhra Pradesh will see TDP win seats which proves good for UPA,
Gujarat might see a close contest between Congress and BJP but it will probably pivot towards Congress since it was already a close contest in state elections but since farmers distress and fuel prices could put Congress in a better postion in urban constituency, as it already does well in rural ones in Gujarat,
Further up look for NC doing well in J&amp;K, good for UPA there too, since the govt broke down and the status of the state hasnt been good. 
After this we look as Delhi-Punjab-Haryana, here its gonna be tight contest, AAP will do better in lok sabha polls in both Punjab and Delhi with Congress doing good in Punjab, seeing how Haryana govt has had to deal will the various rioting and protests, it will probably go more towards Congress, we might see AAP make headways into Haryana.
North-East will be a contest for both local parties, Congress and BJP so expect that to be tight aswell. 

Now, ask me this question in 2017 i would have said no chance for the UPA but now realistically a big multi party coailition could do really well, it might just give BJP a run for its money, my take would be that BJP might not make it to the magical majority mark but NDA coalition could, but then again as you say will they let Modi be the PM, id think yes. UPA looks really well. At the time of 2014 everything was going bad for UPA, all the partnerts were in bad positions, dealing with courruptionc charges etc. Now its all in the backseat, its gon n be a great election in 2019.

 in Bihar, “the 10th percentile set of firms reports obtaining an operating license in one day, while 90th percentile set of firms reports obtaining a license in 90 days.” A company’s regulatory experience is a product of its deal-making ability, not of a neutral governance mechanism

For firms, India’s administratively weakest states are the most tempting targets for regulatory capture that is likely to skew the inclusive, broad-based growth they need.

By enriching politicians and bureaucrats, such deal-making and regulatory capture also creates structural disincentives for improving state capacity. In the absence of such capacity, the value of politicians as middlemen who can help firms cut in line or secure public goods for citizens rises. This, in turn, enables more deal-making, perpetuating the cycle.

Obviously I only had experience of a small local area (in Himachal) so it's difficult- especially for a non-Indian- to get a sense of the nationwide popular opinion-is Modi &amp; the BJP's popularity on the wane in India or is his position still strong?

This was the first time people started mocking Modi openly for all of his many stupid moves and gaffes.

Now his bullshit is being challenged- for the first 2 years he got a free pass.

However the opposition has done little to win people's support, and Modi's party has been crushing opposition with a decentralized 'emergency' - a state in which violent thugs supportive of his party are given free reign, and sent signals that they will not be prosecuted. Journalists who speak against him are getting fired. 

His party has 'content editors' in all major news channels and there are some reddittors claiming that the English media channels most critical of him are being removed from programming in remote rural areas with no explanation - apparently it's being done ""voluntarily"" by the cable operators there. 

A party in Delhi which is doing good work is being viciously harassed by Modi in ways never seen before for a sitting government in power.

nope. you got that wrong. it is exactly because of this that the court admonished the police. if you knew even a little about how police functions, they will keep asking to extend the dates and keep the accused under house-arrest. And the reason why a normal arrest was turned into house-arrest was because prima-facie evidence was so weak. 

&gt;  I thought public disclosure was the essence of democracy and all that jazz.

public discourse during an ongoing investigation? Where does democracy come in this? are you ok?

THe police held the conf to build public opinion. They read out from those fabricated letters to back their cooked up story. Many experts pointed out that naxals dont communicate their plans through letters. Let alone write down details of how many bullets and weapons are needed for the operation.

You can't arrest someone just because he is an ex-convict. There's no double jeopardy in India. 

its shocking that people are buying into this bullshit. Modi did the same thing while in gujrat. Every now and then there used to be rumours that there was a plot to kill him by the terrorist so the public sentiment would go in his favour. He is doing the same on the national stage and people are still lapping it up. 

I'll say this separately so it's easier for you to understand. These arrests were made to divert the attention from RBI's report in which it was mentioned that 99.3% of the notes came back into the system and hence demonetization was a failure.

So much that even his majority has come down in Parliament as his party has not been able to retain even parliament seats that they held in these by-polls.

The opposition, under the Indian National Congress, is confident of forming a united coalition. If Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress party, can indeed pull that off, then the BJP will find it very tough to get majority again. In the 2014 election, Modi's BJP had got around 30% or so vote, and the rest went to the opposition. So if the opposition unite, the BJP will have not chance of getting a majority on its own. Moreover, if the opposition is united, Modi would be hard pressed to form a coalition government too. (As it is, in his arrogance, Narendra Modi has burned his bridges with a lot of the old NDA allies, and even if by some bleak miracle, the BJP manages to form a majority coalition, Narendra Modi wouldn't be acceptable as a PM for the allies.

At the meeting, he was said to have instructed them to ""allow people to vent their anger and not come in the way of a Hindu backlash"". While relating, Pandya had asked that his identity not be revealed, saying ""I will be killed"". He was assassinated six months later.

Pandya told us two important things. One was about the meeting on February 27."" The judge says Pandya said the seniormost police officials were told by Modi that they should expect a Hindu reaction. ""They were also told they should do nothing to contain this reaction.""

&gt;Justice Suresh says the tribunal went on to ask Pandya more details about Modi's role and also posed an all-important question: what would Pandya have done if he was home minister?

The sad thing is that, in addition to the already bigoted section of our society, many others - regular working professionals, and even people on the fence, have turned Modi-bhakts blinded by his media blitzkrieg and propaganda.",2018-09-20 10:15:52
474,"I may be not on top of the news all the time, but why isn't our beloved PM Modi holding a press conference or issuing a statement regarding the state of the economy? I have seen him bashing UPA, Congress in particular, for poor policies constantly. But I haven't read/heard anything that our PM or the Cabinet has said regarding the higher fuel prices, weakening rupee. I mean, they haven't even tried to assure that they're working on issues. I was deeply infuriated by Amit Shah's 'Pakoda' comment on the unemployment issue. WTF? 

All in all, I feel that there's a huge unrest among the masses and the govt is  doing nothing to address it.

&amp;#x200B;

And for the love of God, I have never seen a weaker opposition. BJP is destroying the opposition and there is no retaliation. The Bharath Bandh wasn't as successful as the opposition believed it to be. 

God help us! ",2018-09-20 10:23:22
475,They can and they are. But in Modi's case he changed formula. If modi rules for 50yrs gdp will be 1 and he will make the new formula = old gdp *10. Chanakya neeti!,2018-09-20 10:29:03
476,"+1. People here hate Modi alright. But if they believe that India would be miraculously better off if UPA comes to power, they are behaving like same ostriches as Modi bhakts. The fact is Congress = BJP in 95% of the policies and so the India's economic and social status would not be any different no matter which of the two is in power.",2018-09-20 10:39:37
477,"DeMo was done to win UP elections as a Jumla.

It was fucked.

RBI had to spend 4k crore or something in extra cash. 99% notes are now returned. (This means govt does not have money, they have actually spent extra money to cover the expenses during DeMo)

Modi's style of working is throw ""saaf neeyat kade faisle"" at gullible folks.

So now DeMo failed

So he had to do another drama so he did hasty implementation of GST. This fucked all businesses. 

Now Modi doesn't have good will, neither does he have money.

But he needs money for spending for his advertising. 4k crore reportedly was spent in advert till now.

So he taxes petrol. Crude oil was 35$ barrel and yet petrol was 70rs. He kept adding levies because of gross incompetence.

Now, becayse petrol has hiked, transport fees have hiked. Food is transported in trucks, rates for trucks have hiked. This directly affected prices on the ground. School van union raised fees of vans per month, as did rickshaw drivers, ola uber.

When petrol prices are artificlally inserted it isn't just ""you can afford to pay petrol"" our entire economy based on petrol so if that's artificially inflated like Modi did it rises prices everywhere.

Don't trust modi kaka's economics. They have fudged every number they can fudge till now. Look at ground level, I had to pay 10rs for 5km in shared auto now I have to pay 15Rs. Poha I ate for 20 before Demo &amp; GST it is now 25. 

And yet people need ""strong opposition"" to Modi fir 2019. He has fucked the economy.

Gas subsidis were removed, that saved 5k crre and 4k crore spent on advert. Ghanta focus on infra (unlike Vajpayee govt), only focus on self publicity, harassing reporters who show the truth and crony capitalism.

If you are modi supporter then try reading some real news like caravan magazine o the wire. Or read Yashwt Sinha's and arun shourie's interviews",2018-09-20 10:40:38
478,"Sir, if ppl could not see that Indira Gandhi had screwed with them and that they should vote for opposition even if Monkeys contest elections then it is the Retards to be blamed. Even now, such ppl say ""if RaGa had not been congress pm candidate I'd have voted for INC. i dont want to vote for modi but no choice""

This is like, you are living in a hostel. Your rent owner is sweet to you, says the right things but he loots you from behind. He steals your luggage, bugs house and when you complain he installs cctvs but they are non functioning. But the other hostel owners besides your current hostel are not such great bluff masters, sure, items don't go stolen from other hostels but they are no match for my current owner who keeps raising rent monthly soI don't havea choice. If other owners were equally great then maybe......",2018-09-20 10:49:43
479,Many know that modi misled them but a lot of those supporters hate minorities(especially Muslims) too much to vote for any other party. ,2018-09-20 10:55:33
480,"&gt;people are generally consistent in their personalities so it becomes hard to believe that a person who is not very good at preparing for a speech will be very good at planning for the whole country.

Then Modi would be way better than Manmohan Singh as well by that metric.",2018-09-20 11:03:32
481,"The Pakoda comment originally came from Modi.

The Bharath bandh was not covered by many of the news papers around the country. It helps to have a tight rein over media.",2018-09-20 11:07:54
482,"&gt; but are we sure that he's not a better politician than Modi?

The simple answer is, we don't know... he hasn't held any kind of ministry at the state or national level to show the country of his competence and the only reason he has won the elections are because of the Gandhi name. He should have held some kind of  portfolio under MMS if he was serious about being projected as a PM candidate.",2018-09-20 12:15:31
483,"I get the feeling that people who are staunch Modi supporters even now are those that supported BJP even before Modi. They probably voted for Vajpayee in 2004 and Advani in 2009. 
But the additional voters that Modi brought in 2014, they are ones that are having second thoughts.",2018-09-20 12:43:11
484,"&gt; so it becomes hard to believe that a person who is not very good at preparing for a speech will be very good at planning for the whole country.

Seriously? Articulating has nothing to do with administration. And in any case, between Modi and RaGa, only one of them gulped down a bucket of water and walked away from an interview. ",2018-09-20 12:58:22
485,He who thinks Modi didn't ask Shah to get rid of Pandya is a fool or a willful ignorant. ,2018-09-20 13:46:46
486,"&gt; Rahul Gandhi has done nothing atrocious like Modi.

Why don't people understand this?

This isn't even ""choosing the lesser of evils"" kind of a deal because only one of them is actual evil.",2018-09-20 15:31:43
487,LOC would never be established as a border because Pakistanis aspire to free the WHOLE of Kashmir and liberate their Kashmiri Muslim brothers from the yolk of Indian (predominantly Hindu) rule (especially under current BJP government under modi),2018-09-20 16:24:59
488,Anti-Modi wave,2018-09-20 18:55:33
489,"Less so in Kerala, compared to other indian states, and yet for PM Modi it is Somalia.",2018-09-20 19:22:26
490,"There is not much to read about it. 

Modi kaka fucked up. 

/s (I go on morning walks)",2018-09-20 21:05:52
491,"No, I think it's appropriate.

Modi came to power yelling about corrupt conggress and as soon as they came to power, they didn't look back in corruption scandals.

The hippocracy has to be called out for. In UPS, people actually lost their ministry portfolio hip where as in BJP, they're so fucking smug and arrogant they wouldn't even acknowledge it,",2018-09-20 21:15:09
492,"It's not about hating anyone. It's similar to India's position in a way. Indian politicians favour USA over Russia because Americans have money. Similarly Nepalese politicians favour Chinese over Indians because they have more money. Of course there are some ignorants who try to blame India for everything wrong with the country but they are a minority. There is some hatred towards the Modi government, though mainly because of the blockade. ",2018-09-20 21:20:04
