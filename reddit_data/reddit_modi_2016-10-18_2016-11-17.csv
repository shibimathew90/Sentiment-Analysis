Aam Aadmi Party national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement that his party will fight the Gujarat Assembly elections came with a touch of leaning to caste and reservation politics, a move away from his usual anti-corruption agenda propagated across states.

Kejriwal has been courting young Patidar leader Hardik Patel for some months and his public praise for Hardik has increased in recent days. Hardik has spearheaded the Patidar reservation agitation and was in jail for around a year under charges of sedition before being released recently. Kejriwal condemned police action against agitating Patidars and called Hardik a patriot. It is notable that in the same light, his party has spoken against the BJP, SP, BSP and several others of doing communal or caste politics. He also spoke highly of Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and OBC leader Alpesh Thakore setting a clear picture for his election agenda and the electorate he plans to woo.

Recently this year, leaders from Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti were left flabbergasted when Kejriwal expressed his wishes to meet Hardik to show his sympathies to their cause. One of Hardik’s closest aides Akhilesh Katiyar even commented that Kejriwal’s party has “championed the cause of equality and freedom” and that the Patidars were surprised to see that the Delhi CM had shown his support for a “caste-based reservation movement”.

Hardik’s aides acknowledged in the past that the AAP did not have a huge vote base in the state and with the Patidars comprising over a quarter of the electorate, wooing them will be crucial for the party that had announced that it will fight on all 182 seats in the state. Hardik has on multiple occasions insisted that he doesn’t want to turn his agitation into a political one. However, if the AAP can put up a good fight against the BJP, which has lost significant support from the Patidars, and promise a push for their reservation movement in coming years, Hardik might just guide the support of the huge community to the benefit of Kejriwal.

Kejriwal’s move to invoke the Una incident shows that he intends to keep the incident alive during the poll fray. He condemned the incident where four Dalits were flogged publicly for skinning the a cow’s carcass. Kejriwal applauded Mevani for keeping the Dalit community together in the testing times. Thakore received praise for efforts against bootlegging in the state.

The AAP has done a fair amount of ground work in the state but it still isn’t as robust as in Punjab. If it gets the full support of Hardik, Thakore and Mevani, coupled with the anti-incumbency in the state, the party may pose a significant threat to the ruling BJP that is much weaker than how PM Modi left it when he assumed power at the Centre in 2014.

BENAULIM (GOA): China blocked India's attempts to include the names of terror groups like JeM and LeT in the BRICS'Goa Declarationbut what has hurt the government more, as sources said, is Russia's disinclination to argue India's case. The result, of course, was a declaration which failed to address India's core concern of the issue of state-sponsored terrorism.



What compounded the matter for India was Russia's recent military flirtation with Pakistan in the name of anti-terror exercise. In current global power play, Russia is seen increasingly as needing China more than the other way round, butMoscow's submission to the Chinese position on an issue related to India's security still has come as a revelation to the Indian authorities.



While Russia did not help India name-check JeM, which perpetrated bothPathankotand Uri attacks, in the Goa Declaration, it ensured that Syria-based Jabhat al-Nusra figured in it. As it seeks to bolster theBashar al-Assadregime in Syria, Russia has continued to target al-Nusra, which it accuses of seeking a Caliphate through barbaric methods, in the country. Like the Nusra, JeM and LeT too are proscribed by the UN. Russia called for ""relentless pursuit'' of al-Nusra in the declaration.



As strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney said, Moscow appeared willing to accommodate India's concerns in the Goa Declaration but, in the face of Chinese opposition, shied away from supporting India's case.



""The result was that the declaration failed to mention the most potent form of terrorism in the world, which is state-sponsored. And while citing groups like ISIS and al-Nusra, the declaration conveniently omitted any mention of the Pakistan-based organizations that the UN has designated as terrorist entities,"" he said, adding that the ""anodyne"" declaration called into question the utility of Brics for India.



With Russia doing precious little for India, China could shield Pakistani terrorism not only at the UN Security Council but also at a multilateral summit on Indian soil. In doing so, as Chellaney said, China rode roughshod over Indian concerns and showed itself culpable in the killing of 26 Indian soldiers at Uri and Pathankot.



While Russia itself has been the clear winner in terms of BRICS' focus on security related issues, China continues to call the shots on financial issues, leading to questions about the utility of Brics for India.



""China uses BRICS to advance its economic and political interests, including dominating the two financial mechanisms that the grouping has set up. But what does India get from BRICS?"" said Chellaney.



""Goa showed that while China manages to get its own way, even at India's expense, Indian officials do little other than put on a brave face. Even earlier, when China secured the right instead of India to host the Brics' New Development Bank, Indian officials were left flaunting a consolation prize -- an Indian to be the Bank's first president,"" he added.



The Goa Declaration came just a day after PresidentVladimir Putinassured PM Narendra Modi in their summit meeting that Russia would do nothing to hurt India's interests. As MEA secretary Amar Sinha admitted, there was no consensus on naming Pakistan-based terror groups because other countries are not affected by their actions.



Moscow also had its full say on Syria as the declaration called upon all parties involved to work for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the conflict taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria, through inclusive national dialogue and a Syrian-led political process.



""While continuing the relentless pursuit against terrorist groups so designated by the UN Security Council, including ISIL, Jabhat al-Nusra, and other terrorist organisations designated by the UN Security Council,'' said the declaration.

&gt;The Delhi govenrment only needs to be concerned about Delhi, and for that it just needs to show results for its work as AAP once boasted they would.

Why? They are concerned citizens of the country too and if they feel they need to communicate something of national significance ( like the center running an aggressive malicious campaign against them) they have the right and duty to.

&gt;The results are not forthcoming and that is why they are having to use PR to promote themselves like the much-trumpeted Odd Even scheme that utterly failed to have any impact on Delhi air quality levels.

On the contrary , I think they are doing very well. The mohalla clinics for example are being imitated by Gujarat government. Some initiatives will work and some will fail as with all governments, but they have to counter the rabid PR that the bjp is throwing at them. if you look around , you would notice that the MSM is not focusing on any other CM. Even massively corrupt governments like TN, MP, Bihar and UPA don't get as much negative coverage as does the Delhi government and AK. I feel part of the reason is that AK is the one opposition that can pose a challenge to Modi  sooner or later and bjp knows it. 

&gt;And if you're making comparisons the Delhi government is still disproportionately spending more than any other in India including the Centre which faces significantly more media scrutiny on a daily basis.

Any source/proof for this ? or would I be called anti national for asking for proof ?

6,"&gt;Why? They are concerned citizens of the country too and if they feel they need to communicate something of national significance ( like the center running an aggressive malicious campaign against them) they have the right and duty to.

The guidelines by Election Commission and courts have elaborated on this and it's common sense. The Delhi government's responsibility is to the Delhi people who elected them. Political games are a different issue. If any official communication has to be made to Delhi people it should only be through local media. 

If the CM wants to say or do something as a concerned citizen or opposition leader he should do so in his own capacity with his own money, not using state machinery and taxpayer money. Otherwise it becomes an open invitation to do political propaganda using the Delhi government funds. AAP fans know this and support it for that exact reason.

&gt;On the contrary , I think they are doing very well. The mohalla clinics for example are being imitated by Gujarat government

The fact that you only have this to brag about and immediately start harping how BJP is throwing PR at poor AAP(As if they don't do the same every day against the BJP and the PM in particular) shows things are not so well. When Kejriwal started his second term(first term too) AAP would repeatedly state that they wanted to develop Delhi first for 5 years and then show it as a model to the rest of India. Instead they're desperate to spread to other states as fast as they can because no matter how much they blame Najeeb Jung the undeniable truth is they've failed to keep many of their promises and lost a lot of ground with Delhi voters.

Kejriwal gets more coverage because he actively courts the media and bases his politics from Delhi where most 'national' media outlets have their headquarters. AAP intentionally started in Delhi BECAUSE of this reason and this easy exposure to the media was the main reason for their rise to prominence. It's obviously a double-edged sword because if you give off a negative image the media that is close to you will cover that too. This has nothing to do with PR campaigns and it's rich for AAP supporters to be complaining about that.

&gt;I feel part of the reason is that AK is the one opposition that can pose a challenge to Modi sooner or later and bjp knows it.

And that AAP's core supporters are behind them and defending them like yourself here: He makes you think he can defeat Modi. He knows that this is your main motivation and that's why for good or bad reasons he makes sure to stay in the limelight so that the sizeable population of ideologically motivated voters who will condone violence, corruption, casteism, communalism and literally anything so long as Kejriwal remains anti-Modi will continue to support him and defend his actions.

&gt;Any source/proof for this ? or would I be called anti national for asking for proof ?

I was the one wondering if I'd be called a Modi bhakt or BJP stooge or IT cell member since that's what AAP and their fans do to anyone who questions them or their allegations.

There are many articles about the increase in AAP's ad spending but since AAP is always obsessed in comparing themselves to the BJP(Role model? Aim to be BJP with Kejriwal instead of Modi?) I'll point to this:

**Google 'Modi government spent 864+ crore on advertisements. How can BJP justify it morally and have the right to attack AAP spendings on the same?'** and you'll find a Quora discussion with detailed analyses comparing the Delhi ad budget(for one city) with the Central ad spending(for all of India).

Let's not mix opinions and facts.  There were multiple reasons for AAP starting with Delhi. One was of the India Against Corruption campaign which had massive traction in Delhi with all the protests and marches going on. Delhi has a huge educated population which helps a party like AAP. The immediate reason was the outrage after Nirbhaya rape case and the then education minister throwing the gauntlet to Kejriwal to run for elections if he wants a say in the government.

The 67-3 result in Delhi kinda proves that he can.

&gt;""India's own fault-lines in their alienated Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and Dalits as well as the growing Maoist insurgency (should) be highlighted,"" the policy paper reads. This seems to be a measure to counter PM Modi's reference to Balochistan in recent weeks.

&gt;It further said, ""Modi and his RSS ideology of Hindutva should be targeted.

  NEW DELHI: The government has begun a mammoth exercise to overhaul the system of collecting key statistics on inflation, industrial production, consumption and employment to restore the credibility of official economic data, which took a severe beating after a new series of national accounts was released last year.  

 

  In a wholesale clean-up attempt, five committees have been set up to review data for GDP estimates, provide for mechanisms to ensure “data integrity” and come up with industry-wise and geography-wise disaggregated data – something that is not available in the current system.  

 

  The committee on financial sector statistics is headed by Ravindra Dholakia, a member of the newly constituted Monetary Policy Committee.  

 

  “These committees are expected to cover the requirement of statistics for estimation of GDP, data governance for quality, timelines and credibility of collected data and derived estimates, provide for data integrity and audit trials of a National Statistical System,” the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation said in a directive.  

 

  The exercise, according to National Statistical Commission Chairman RB Barman, will make monitoring the performance evaluation of data more effective.  

 

  “The enhanced transparency that will be available will go a long way for re-ensuring the credibility of the National Statistical System. A focused attention on district-level statistics will also serve the needs of the Human Development Index,” he said.  

 

  Through the committees, which are chaired by experts from various institutes, the commission also wants to put the fiscal statistics of the government – expenditure and revenue – in a centralised repository.  

 

  The committees have been set up when the statistics office is struggling with persistent doubts about the new series of national accounts that had puzzled even Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian and former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan.  

 

  The new series of national accounts, which changed the methodology of estimating output from the internationally followed factor cost to market prices, bumped up growth for FY14 to 6.9% from 5% estimated under the earlier methodology.  

 

  The new series continues to be questioned even now for the over 7% growth being out of sync with industrial production, among other indicators.

24,"&gt; if a sitting elected popular CM/PM campaigns for you, that is actually positive to rally the party base and attract attention of undecided voters to the candidate.

It is good for the party but for the democracy it isn't much. It is great when you can bring a candidate for a seat elected, but for the position of CM that is going to be a leader itself it isn't. The voters aligned didn't align with the candidate because of the candidate but because of someone that is not going to be their leader or representative.


&gt;It is not bad at all because the whole point of campaigning is to attract attention to you or the candidate a party prefers, so a regional leader would be more than glad to have a national leader on stage as it brings him/her national media attention more than the competitors.

It is one thing being on stage, it is other thing to have stage just up to you. How many people member the BJP candidate for Bihar, AAP candidate for Punjab or Gujarat? You aren't making leaders if they need to hide behind national leaders. 

&gt;It's also useful for candidates who are very capable but are not great public speakers.

It is a skill that is required, if you don't have it then what happens when that national leader that supported you no longer does so. This strategy doesn't create leaders, it creates pawns. And the democracy needs leaders not pawns. 

&gt;So it is not bad for democracy because once a candidate is elected, they are on their own to deal with the workings. What makes for weaker leaders are up to the party's innnerworking

Their is difference between a single rally and the whole campaign. What Kejriwal here and Modi have done over the past year isn't getting candidate elected, it is a namesake standing for them elected. If this was say Jayalalitha doing single rally to show support  for Mamata Banerjee, it is another when Jayalalitha is the main show of all the rallies or major rallies. It isn't Mamata Banerjee that is bringing the support, it is Jayalalitha and Jayalalitha isn't going to be ruling them. Also, this is how you make weak leaders, if the leader can't fend for him/herself then s/he is going to be strong. 

&gt;Some parties tend to nurture new candidates by putting full weight behind them. You usually see it in party's which are not domain of one family.

And they allow the person to take leadership not babysit them behind their main candidate. Remember when Mahagadhbandhan won in Bihar, a coalition of shit. BJP didn't even have the CM candidate in the posters that is the issue. I still don't know the Punjab or Gujarat CM candidate. From my perspective it is Kejriwal. This isn't good for democracy if the leaders are just proxy for other leaders. 

&gt;What is bad for democracy is the grip on family-run party's who especially when in power only look out for select few within their party at the cost of local leaders. That is what is hurting Congress and will hurt other family or single person party like AIADMK, TMC, BJD etc.

That is also killing of democracy. I have never supported such behaviour and why I will never vote Congress unless all members of Gandhi family are removed from party leadership

&gt;* Last month Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in Mumbai that a policy to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment is in works.

&gt;* India has become one of the biggest clients of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers and in the absence of its own domestic capacity, that reliance could potentially grow.

1. Russia itself has been the clear winner in terms of BRICS’ focus on security-related issues

BENAULIM (GOA): China blocked India's attempts to name JeM and LeT in theGoa Declaration+, wherein theBricsmember states pledged to ""relentlessly pursue"" outfits designated terrorist groups by the UNSC, but what has hurt the government more, sources said, isRussia's disinclination to argue India's case.



The result, of course, was a declaration which failed to address India's core concern, or the issue ofstate-sponsored terrorism+. What compounded the matter for India was Russia's recent military flirtation withPakistanin the form of an anti-terror exercise. In current global power play, Russia is increasingly seen as needing China more than the other way round, but Moscow's submission to Beijing's position on an issue related to India's security has still come as a revelation to New Delhi.



While Russia did not help Indianame-check JeM+, which perpetrated both the Pathankot and Uri attacks, in the declaration, it ensured that Syria-based Jabhat al-Nusra was. As it seeks to bolster the Bashar al-Assad regime, Russia has continued to target al-Nusra, which it accuses of pursuing, through barbaric methods, a caliphate inSyria. Al-Nusra is among the groups fighting to topple al-Assad.



Like Nusra, JeM and LeT too are proscribed by the UN. Strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney said Moscow appeared willing to accommodate India's concerns, but, in the face of Chinese opposition, shied away. ""The result was that the declaration failed to mention the most potent form of terrorism in the world, which is state-sponsored,"" he added.



With Russia doing precious little for India, China has managed to shield Pakistani terrorism not only at the UN Security Council but also at a multilateral summit on Indian soil. In doing so, Chellaney said, China rode roughshod over Indian concerns and showed itself culpable in the killing of 26 Indian soldiers at Uri and Pathankot.



While Russia itself has been the clear winner in terms of Brics' focus on security-related issues, China continues to calls the shots on financial issues, leading to questions about the utility of Brics for India. ""China uses Brics to advance its economic and political interests, including dominating the two financial mechanisms that the grouping has set up. But what does India get from Brics?"" Chellaney said. ""Goa showed that while China manages to get its own way, even at India's expense, Indian officials do little other than put on a brave face. Even earlier, when China secured the right to host the Brics bank, Indian officials were left flaunting a consolation prize — that an Indian would be the bank's first president,"" he added.



The Goa Declaration came just a day after President Vladimir Putin assured PM Narendra Modi that Russia would do nothing to hurt India's interests. But, as MEA secretary Amar Sinha admitted, there was no consensus on naming Pakistan-basedterrorgroups because other nations are not affected by their actions.

&gt;* Addressing a convocation function of a women's college here, Gandhi lauded the state government for improving the child sex ratio from 830/1000 to 910 this year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign from Panipat in January last year.

&gt;* Khattar had recently said that Haryana had lowest child sex ratio in the country as per census 2011, but that it had now crossed the benchmark SRB of 900 for the first time in December 2015.

&gt;* During her address, Gandhi touched upon the initiatives taken by the Narendra Modi government to assist women in cases of crime against them.

&gt;* ""There would be panic button safety features on cell phones, which women can use in case of any threat of molestation or any such incident.It will alert the nearest police station beside alerting other cell phone users near the victim about the potential threat to her,"" she said.

38,He is literally anti-Modi. Add everything bad you can think of about Modi or Congress while being opposed to them and you get Kejriwal.,2016-10-18 20:22:40
39,Strong BJP performance so far has been due to weak Congress and weaker trust in Congress. Under ABV and Modi they have tried to build  'the party that does work' image. The anti-Muslim rhetoric may get you some small number of seats. Maybe when a state not the country though. There are states where religious issues aren't major.  ,2016-10-18 20:27:33
40,"&gt;Oh please, keep your delusional presumptions to yourself... I am a part of Kejriwal's core fan base, I know the people around me. There's serious arguments between us supporters whenever he does something like calling Hardik Patel a desh bhakt. 

If so it must be in hushed whispers where no bystanders can hear you lest it tarnish the godman's reputation. Core AAP supporters are 2 types:

1. Remnants of the anti-corruption activism era who still yearn for clean politics. They can see AAP is transforming into something different from what they first signed up for but see no better alternatives for the time being, so they just keep quiet and try to be optimistic and downplay whatever negatives they hear(*'Must be fake allegations'*, *'They need this dirty system so they can succeed and then clean the dirty system which keeps them in power Oh Wait...'*, *'B-but what about the mohalla clinics?'* and so on)

2. The main core of AAP today that Kejriwal has been carefully building up since 2014: Those people that base their entire idealogy and politics around anti-BJP/Sanghism. Formerly core Congress/reginal party supporters, used to and accepting of all forms of dirty politics so long as it is opposed to Narendra Modi. These are the kind who agreesively spew bile and venom at anyone who dares criticize Kejriwal(Even if it's fellow AAP leaders), call everyone Modi stooge, bhakt, IT cell member, PR agent etc. and are completely unshaken at any act of corruption, crime, casteism or communalism Kejriwal practices beyond *'How dare you, Modi bhakt! Doesn't BJP do XYZ! We need this for clean politics! DESH JALDI BADLEGA!'*

You seem to be a mix of the two.

&gt;Our vision is transparent, corruption-free decentralized politics focusing on education and health.

Is that sarcasm?

&gt;corruption-free 

AAP's had countless allegations of corruption and criminality for well over a year. There are many cases of questionable party funding. Several MLAs have been arrested and several members of Kejriwal's cabinet sacked on various charges. Even state unit chiefs like the Punjab chief were implicated. Anna Hazare himself publicly disowned Kejriwal and gave up any hope in the AAP.

&gt;decentralized

This is the biggest joke. What part of AAP is decentralized? Kejriwal runs anything, manages every election and there are no other leaders. Anyone who tried to be assertive was either kicked out(All major AAP founders besides Kejriwal, several state chiefs) or refused entry(Sidhu). It is literally a one-man party. If Kejriwal dies tomorrow AAP will die with him.

&gt; focusing on education and health

I guess you're saying this because the mohalla clinics are all AAP supporters have left to brag about in terms of 'change'.

Does Hardik Patel, quota politics, caste-based violence and the demand to free 102 Patidars convicted in 2002 riots fit into your vision? What about Lalu Prasad Yadav and his jungle raj?",2016-10-18 20:33:39

&gt; * In current global power play, Russia is increasingly seen as needing China more than the other way round, but Moscow's submission to Beijing's position on an issue related to India's security has still come as a revelation to New Delhi.While Russia did not help India name check JeM, which perpetrated both the Pathankot and Uri attacks, in the declaration, it ensured that Syria-based Jabhat to al-Nusra was.

43,"#Earlier one heard of Israel, Indian Army no less: PM Modi on surgical strike

Hailing the Army for its surgical strikes on terror launch pads along the Line of Control, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday said “earlier one heard about Israel doing such a thing, now the country has seen that the Indian Army is no less”.

Addressing the BJP’s parivartan rally at the Paddal Maidan in Mandi, the Prime Minister, who described Himachal Pradesh as not just a “devbhoomi” (land of gods) but also a “virbhoomi” (land of braves) where there is a tradition of every family sending a member to the Army, said the entire country was discussing the Army’s strikes.

Drawing loud cheers with his praise of ex-servicemen for providing “strength” to the new generation, Modi took a swipe at previous Congress governments at the Centre for delaying and misleading people on the issue of one rank-one pension (OROP) for 40 years.

Watch what else is making news

He said the earlier governments never did an analysis of the OROP cost burden and how it could be executed. “I did it and was puzzled to find that the economic burden kept rising. It worked out to be more than Rs 10,000 crore,” he said, adding it was difficult for any government to make such a big allocation in one go.

He said he spoke to the armed forces and offered to release the money in four instalments to which they agreed. “Over Rs 5,500 crore in the first instalment has been given. The rest too will be done. A promise hanging fire for 40 years has been fulfilled,” he said.

Targeting Virbhadra Singh, Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh where elections are due next year, Modi said BJP chief ministers were known for dedicating themselves to causes like drinking water and roads — Shanta Kumar was known as “paaniwala mukhya mantri” for his work on water supply schemes while Prem Kumar Dhumal was known as “sadakwala mukhya mantri” for his road construction works.

“Do I need to explain what the current chief minister is known for?” Modi asked the crowd about Virbhadra Singh who is facing corruption allegations. He said there were demands for seeking an account of the money sent to the state government. “Not only us, the people of Himachal Pradesh will demand an answer (from Virbhadra Singh).”

Recalling his old associating with Himachal Pradesh when he was then a BJP general secretary, Modi said the projects he was inaugurating were founded by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “I was also present as the organisation’s in-charge and who would have thought that I will get the opportunity to inaugurate them,” he said.

The Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation three flagship 800 MW hydropower station of NTPC-Koldam, 520 MW Parbati project of NHPC and 412 MW Rampur hydro station of SJVNL. Appreciating the contribution of public sector companies in the country’s growth, Modi said that the hydro projects will bring prosperity to Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the nation.

These are just 'economic' factors which affect you slowly. There are social factors which affect your life much more.

During UPA, it was OK to say the government is shit. Now I have someone asking me to go to Pakistan if I don't like it here so much. Lower level trolls and rioters feel encouraged because they know it's 'their government'. Everything is an excuse to have a go at the previous government, 'liberals' or anyone deemed anti-national.

Sluggish agricultural growth not only impedes alleviation of agrarian distress but also the success of “Make in India”. This is because the demand required for triggering growth in the manufacturing sector depends to a large extent on domestic purchasing power. Productivity growth in agriculture can boost the purchasing power of over half of the country’s population dependent on it.

Indian agriculture is starving for new technology and genetic engineering can offer hope. After years of stagnation, productivity jumped sharply in 2002 with the arrival of the first approved GM (genetically modified) crop, Bt cotton.

India now figures among the world’s largest cotton producers and exporters as a result of the spread of Bt cotton. But thereafter, the development of this technology was thwarted by anti-genetically modified organism (GMO) groups on the Left. Yielding to their pressure, the previous government reversed the decision of the country’s highest regulatory authority, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), and stopped the commercial release of Bt brinjal. This was a big jolt for the nascent biotechnology industry while farmers continued to be deprived of the benefits of modern biotechnology.

In 2014, Modi arrived on the national political scene in this backdrop of stagnant growth and desperation in the agriculture sector. His rousing speeches in the rural areas during the last parliamentary elections naturally received an overwhelming response. Posing as the “CEO” the country needed, he raised hopes of bringing in modern technology to help the ailing agriculture sector. But, even after two-and-half years in power, nothing has changed. The ban on Bt brinjal continues. The only difference is that the influence of the anti-GMO civil societies has been replaced by similar ideological opposition from the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch and Kisan Sangh, organizations affiliated to the RSS—BJP’s ideological parent. We haven’t seen a single statement of support from the Prime Minister to rescue technology from such ideological discourse.

This is surprising given the role Modi played as Gujarat’s chief minister. It would be instructive to visit that story.

In 2001, the state of Gujarat saw a massive attack of bollworms, a pest, on its cotton crop. Large tracts of cotton crops were destroyed. But there was a surprise. Amidst brown and dead patches, there stood cotton in resplendent green and white. It was discovered that these crops contained the Bt gene that kills the bollworm. This was the first GM crop that had entered the Indian soil by stealth. The GEAC had not given its approval to any GM crop by then. In fact, this illegal Bt cotton had entered the Gujarat three years ago but wasn’t noticed until 2001.

A large network operated in Gujarat which crossbred the locally successful hybrids with the variety that contained the Bt gene. These networks prospered under Modi’s watch and they supplied Bt cottonseeds all over India. The discovery of the illegal Bt cotton alarmed the central government. But the state government took no action. Thus, Modi helped the farmers in availing the first GM seeds, albeit through inaction rather than active support.

If he could allow ‘illegal’ GM crop, why is he opposed to Bt brinjal, which has cleared all the safety tests? Why is PM Modi of 2016 so different from the CM Modi of 2001? Why does the big political capital that he commands come to a naught when it comes to advocating for GMOs? From where does the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch or Kisan Sangh derive its political strength to dictate terms to the supposedly most powerful politician today?

Such influence is indeed disturbing.

Another instance of this influence is how, disregarding its assurance of ‘minimum government -maximum governance’, the centre scrapped the private contract between the Mahyco-Monsanto (MM) and the ‘Swadeshi’ cotton hybrid companies that sourced technology from the former. It expropriated about 74% of the profits of MM and distributed a large part of it to the ‘Swadeshi’ companies. The absurdity of this decision was that the reason given was the diminished effectiveness of this technology without explaining why then the government was bothered about lowering its price.

While it is important to not let any one organisation establish a monopoly over such technology solutions, the consequences of such a populist move can be equally grave for the farmers who are dependent on the technology provider when the effectiveness of the present system breaks down.

There is no doubt that the government must create a competitive environment to bring down the cost of technology for the farmers. This can happen if we strengthen our research institutes in the public sector.

But the commercial release of GM mustard, developed in the public sector, has taken a very long time. There are indications of the government’s support for this technology, but it is still not clear why it has not reversed the previous government’s ban on Bt brinjal.

In 2001 Modi followed the masses as it helped him politically. But now he must use his political capital and lead from the front. Technology-starved farmers expect a firm vocal commitment from the PM.

71,"&gt; I don't know if Modi has a direct hand in this or not but his ministers and party members along with many saffron gangs do.

He absolutely does, have no doubt about it. Very cunningly he never acts against or admonishes right wing loonies inside the BJP like Muzaffarnagar rioters, Giriraj Singh, adityanath etc. Instead he rewards them with cabinet positions. He follows a similar pattern for the nationalism charade as well.

&gt; These are the signs of a dictatorship not a democracy.

Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. As Gujarat CM he left no stone unturned to create a personality cult revolving around him. He wants to have the same cult at a national level. 

He is encouraging people like Arnab Goswami who build up this image further and further. He even enlisted Mukesh Ambani to say something on the lines of 'I am not an intellectual. I am a patriot.' 

&gt; Do you think this attitude will bite BJP in 2019?

Hope the UP election will teach the BJP a lesson.",2016-10-19 10:38:27

73,"Vajpayee did more for this country then most other previous prime minister.

If it was not for him and decision to face the political pressure and domestic and international backlash following nuclear tests planned by PV rao ,we would still be non nuclear state

We would be isolated completely on the international front.

Our economy would have been in complete shambles if he had given in to the demands of the public and IMF
And completely reversed the liberalization measure that had been undertaken by PV rao 

He assuaged the fear of minorities regarding a non Congress government and was personally in favour of making modi resign post Gujarat riots.

He could have exploited the kargil war Victory for political gains and domestic capital but he decided to take the high road after being asked to by the army and to ensure the situation between India and Pakistan dosent get further flaired up.

His ultimate downfall was focusing too much on the big picture and long term planning.
The fruits of his long term planning were enjoyed by UPA1

Vajpayee laid down the foundations for the economic growth seen during UPA rule 

So before maligning someone based on things that don't even count,know FACTS

Edit: for those curious why I used IMF, heres why:

IMF wasn't completely happy with the liberalization measures taken by PV rao. It wanted more aggressive measures in future and further disinvestment from PSU This was in opposite to the public who wanted a large government run machinery.

Both of them were detrimental to the indian Economy. Rao stuck a fine balance between liberalization and conservation. If we had gone full liberalization in very short time like the IMF wanted ,we would have ended up like Russia after Soviet collapse.

  NEW DELHI: Having commissioned a 182-metre tall Statue of Unity in his memory and declared Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birth anniversary – October 31 – as Rashtriya Ekta Divas, the Modi government is set to take its commemoration of the former Congressman to yet another level.  

 

  The Centre has decided that one day is not sufficient to honour the first deputy prime minister of independent India. The country will commemorate Sardar Patel for a whole week this year. The Rashtriya Ekta Suptah will be observed across the country from October 31 to November 6, driving home the message of national unity against a backdrop of escalating tension with neighbouring Pakistan.  

 

  A nationwide campaign titled ‘Nation Salutes Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel – the Unifier of India’ will be observed across institutes and departments. The Rashtriya Ekta Diwas so far has seen the PM paying floral tributes at the Sardar Patel statue on Parliament Street in New Delhi, flagging off Unity Runs and government servants taking the Pledge of Unity.  

 

  In a communication issued to institutes, they have been asked to honour the memory of Sardar Patel by conducting programmes and events that reflect his decisive efforts in unifying a diverse country like India so as to create a single political, socio-economic and administrative entity for governance under independent India.  

 

  A range of activities and events are to be conducted through the week by higher educational institutions and schools in the country need to be built around the theme of unification, strengthening and bonding of the nation.  

 

  As part of the Rashtriya Ekta Suptah, Unity Runs will be held in cities, towns and rural areas by students with the message of a unified Bharat. Educational institutions will bring out creative clips on unification and the best three will be selected for presenting to the Prime Minister’s Office.  

 

  Inter-department competitions on the theme of unity, besides plays and musicals, will be held across educational institutes. As has been the norm under the Modi regime, there will be essay contests on the character and contributions of Sardar Patel and his relevance and importance today. Students will be involved in making efforts to mobilise and felicitate former freedom fighters in their regions during this week. These freedom fighters will be encouraged to share their memories of Sardar Patel and their views on the theme of unity.  

 

  Indicating that the campaign is rather high priority, all educational institutes have been asked to plan their campaigns for the week and inform the human resource development ministry ‘urgently.’  

 

  HRD minister Prakash Javadekar is said to have conducted a video conference to brief states on how to conduct the campaign. It has also been communicated that photographs of campaign activities must be sent to the Centre over WhatsApp and to dedicated email addresses.

This has become an annual ritual. The Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) releases its Global Hunger Index, ranking countries in proportion to their population faced with hunger and under-nutrition. India ranks 97 among the 118 developing nations, faring worse than all its neighbours, except Pakistan.

In the first such index prepared in 2006, India had ranked 96 among 119 countries. This year, when the GDP growth rate is being claimed to be among the highest in the world, India has fared worse than where it stood 10 years ago.



I am not surprised. After the report is released, the media performs the ritual of diligently reporting about India’s abysmal ranking in hunger. It is then forgotten and picked up again when the next report is released. The same kind of editorials, the same kind of commentary pieces. Once the issue fades away, the media and policy makers forget about hunger and move on to better the economic growth prospects: more six-lane highways, more mega irrigation projects, more airports at mofussil towns, infrastructure projects, privatisation of forests

and natural resources.



Removing hunger has never been in the priority list. Every prime minister has talked of fighting hunger and poverty. Indira Gandhi had launched the Garibi Hatao programme. Manmohan Singh called malnourishment “a national shame”. An emotional Narendra Modi had dedicated his government to the poor when he first addressed the BJP parliamentary party meeting in the Central Hall. Yet, hunger has remained robustly sustainable. A fourth of the world’s estimated 800 million hungry live in India. India’s record in fighting hunger and child mortality is worse than that in Sub-Saharan Africa.



In public debates when the National Food Security Act was being discussed in 2013, I recall the strong opposition that came from mainline economists who only viewed the expenditure to feed 50 per cent poor in the urban and 75 per cent poor in rural areas to be nothing but wasteful costs. They had argued against the proposed outlay, saying it would only add to the country’s huge fiscal deficit. Whether it is the budgetary outlay for MGNREGS or agriculture, the effort has been to restrict it to bare minimum. Dismantling pivotal social security nets such as public sector education and health has added to rural and urban poverty.



Prime Minister Modi has a great opportunity to take the bull by the horns and launch a frontal attack on eliminating poverty and hunger. Knowing that all past efforts have failed, the monumental task would need a fresh and holistic approach. If the government can be seen making an effort on month-to-month basis on improving its Ease of Doing Business ranking, I see no reason why India’s ranking in the Global Hunger index cannot be turned upside down. All it requires is a strong political will.

Beijing:  The call for boycott of Chinese goods on Indian social media is ""rabble rousing"" as Indian products cannot compete with those of China, the state-owned media said on Wednesday.



In an acerbic op-ed, state-run Global Times says New Delhi can only ""bark"" and do nothing about the growing trade deficit between two countries.



China's continued opposition to India's effort to declare Pakistan-based terrorists as international terrorists has angered many Indians who have called for a boycott of Chinese products.



It described Prime Minster Narendra Modi's pet project ""Make in India"" as ""impractical"".



The daily warned Chinese companies not to invest in India as it would be ""suicidal"" to put money in a country where corruption is high and the workforce is not hard working.



""There has been a lot of talk recently in the Indian media as well as on social media about boycotting Chinese products. It's just rabble rousing,"" it said.



""Indian manufacturing cannot compete at all with Chinese products, for various reasons.""



The daily said that India was to yet build roads and highways and had chronic shortage of power and water supply.



""Worst of all, corruption is highly prevalent from top to bottom in every single government department.""



It slammed India for courting the US.



""The US is no one's friend. The Americans are just indulging India in order to contain China, as the US is jealous of China's development and global power.



""India has enough money but the majority of it is concentrated with politicians, bureaucrats and a few crony capitalists. Indian elites don't want to spend funds available in the country, which in reality is the taxpayers' money but is utilized by the Indian establishment for its own personal consumption.



""Because of this, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started impractical schemes like 'Make in India'. The reason is that the Indian establishment wants foreign companies to invest in the country.



""It would be completely suicidal for Chinese companies to put their money in India by starting manufacturing projects there. The labour class in India is not very hard working or efficient,"" it argued.



The daily said that instead of opening shops in India, Chinese companies should set up their manufacturing units in China.



The world's third-largest smartphone maker, Huawei, opened its manufacturing unit in India last month.



""In any case, Indian businessmen flock to China in large numbers to buy products from China and sell them in India. This model suits China, so why disturb it by going and wasting money setting up manufacturing facilities in India?



""Let the Indian authorities bark about the growing trade deficit with China. The fact of the matter is they cannot do anything about it.""

&gt;If the distressing GDP signals are anything to go by, Modi/BJP will bite the dust in 2019 as Vajpayee's India Shining did in 2004.

This is never going to happen. By the end of 2017 you will see the govt launch a novel scheme to help a lot of people. But it will be the kind of scheme which will not allow a man to learn how to fish, just feed him free fish without teaching how. This scheme will allow the BJP to practically smash through the roof with their votes. Nobody knows how to play politics better than the BJP does. There is good reason why there is a lull in govt we-did-this-we-did-that from the past 6 months. It will continue for another year and it will go back to its usual dance routine. The congress has already written their obituaries in advance. The other parties are too idiotic to form a base without significant infighting.

&gt; * Previous Indian governments have hardly been friends of free expression or dissent, and the current one is far from being dictatorial, but whats worrying is that, unlike the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance administration or the first National Democratic Alliance ruling coalition, the Bharatiya Janata Party under Modi has a distinct authoritarian mindset.

&gt; * These should include being able to enjoy a lovingly restored decades-old film from Pakistan on the big screen, regardless of whether Narendra Modi is feeling favourably inclined towards that nation, (as he was till very recently, even after militants from across the border killed Indian soldiers in Pathankot) or denouncing it as the mother-ship of terrorism.

Twitter

During the ongoing debate on whether Pakistani artists should be banned or not, Anurag Kashyap expressed his opinion and to extend his support to his friend and colleague, Karan Johar, he reached out to PM Narendra Modi on Twitter.

He tweeted,

@narendramodi Sir you haven't yet said sorry for your trip to meet the Pakistani PM.. It was dec 25th. Same time KJo was shooting ADHM? Why? — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) October 16, 2016

However, that backfired for Kashyap and many started trolling him.

Even though he clarified and explained his state of mind, Kashyap chose to write an open letter on Facebook regarding the same. Making a point on how Bollywood is targetted for both making an opinion and choosing to stay silent, Kashyap wrote:

""It's unfortunate that I have to explain my intention behind my tweet, because others and my industry colleagues have to suffer for me having an opinion.. here it is

""I am tired of the film industry being soft targets. We are damned if we do, damned if we don’t! When we don’t involve ourselves, they ask “why is Bollywood quiet now?” When we involve ourselves, we become the scapegoats to distract you from the real news. Either way they use us to sensationalise news. Still, I’d rather put my opinions out there on my own platform, than give the media a bite. NO, Anurag Kashyap did not “ask the PM to apologise”( which most of the headlines would want you to believe, no one has their mind anyways) ,I merely questioned the fairness in judgement of a situation: the PM visited Pakistan for talks at the same time that a filmmaker was working with a Pakistani actor. Neither was aware of future events or mood. Yet only one pays the price. I’m also well aware that the government did not cry “BAN"" or demand that Pakistani artists be sent back. Just as I’m aware that the PM himself doesn’t censor my films. But we elected them and so it is their responsibility to protect us from bullies - media or political parties. And when the governing party's designated members don't respond in hours of crisis because they are second guessing the mood of the PM then I would rather talk straight to the PM himself. There was also sarcasm in the tweet that followed; ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ was for those mindless trollers who constantly ask for proof of your patriotism. Apparently thats all it takes. It was a jibe at them. Patriotic slogans don’t absolve you from it all. I hope this explains .. """"

111,"Amazing! You restored your whole deleted comment, but deleted another one responding to my comment (calling my comment something to the tune of half informed for reading out the meaning of your words back to you). I'm simply pasting your comment  in its entirity below, so interested readers can enjoy the comedy, in case you decide to delete it again. I've already answered a couple of points in my other comments, and will now proceed to express my awe at the rest:

&gt;He assuaged the fear of minorities regarding a non Congress government and was personally in favour of making modi resign post Gujarat riots.

In fact, the drunkard was so much in favour of making the butcher resign, that all it took was for the butcher and his mosque destroying mentor to raise their eyebrows to get the drunkard to shut up. If he really cared enough about the social fabric of the country, not just the minorities, he would have threatened to resign if the butcher didn't (and actually resigned if he continued being the CM). You think feku had the balls to stand up to him in those days? But then what do you expect from a man who pretended to be moderate while the mompurush was pulling the mosque down, and was happy to enjoy the fruits of the communal, criminal actions of his compatriot? Getting drunk and writing tepid poetry doesn't make you a statesman.

&gt;He could have exploited the kargil war Victory for political gains and domestic capital but he decided to take the high road after being asked to by the army and to ensure the situation between India and Pakistan dosent get further flaired up.

Thank you for pointing out the low low road taken by feku in going to town about ""surgical strikes"", after firebombing a few huts. But you miss the part where the drunkard slept for months while Pakistani army established itself in Kargil heights. The cost of that prolonged stupor was in hundreds if not thousands of crores, and more importantly wasted lives of our soldiers.

&gt;His ultimate downfall was focusing too much on the big picture and long term planning. The fruits of his long term planning were enjoyed by UPA1

We agree here. His long term planning, such as the coal scam came to fruition during and was enjoyed thoroughly by UPA 1 and 2.

&gt;So before maligning someone based on things that don't even count,know FACTS

Thank you for sharing your encyclopedia of misunderstood FACTS, and providing us with so much entertainment.

&gt; If it was not for him and decision to face the political pressure and domestic and international backlash following nuclear tests planned by PV rao ,we would still be non nuclear state

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We would be isolated completely on the international front.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Our economy would have been in complete shambles if he had given in to the demands of the public and IMF And completely reversed the liberalization measure that had been undertaken by PV rao

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Edit: for those curious why I used IMF, heres why:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; IMF wasn't completely happy with the liberalization measures taken by PV rao. It wanted more aggressive measures in future and further disinvestment from PSU This was in opposite to the public who wanted a large government run machinery.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Both of them were detrimental to the indian Economy. Rao stuck a fine balance between liberalization and conservation. If we had gone full liberalization in very short time like the IMF wanted ,we would have ended up like Russia after Soviet collapse.

&gt;* After his no-holds-barred tweets on Monday, noted filmmaker Anurag Kashyap took to his Facebook page on Wednesday to reiterate his point and also explain the context of his outburst against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* The 44-year-old director, in series of tweets recently, had questioned why should only Indian filmmakers be targeted for casting Pakistani actors when the PM also made a trip to Lahore last year.

&gt;* The director, who was speaking against the demand by a section to ban Karan Johars film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil because it has Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, said people from the industry are always the first to be bullied.

&gt;* The director said though the demand to ban the movies starring Pakistani artistes was not made by the government, the elected members should protect people from bullies.

&gt;* There was also sarcasm in the tweet that followed; Bharat Mata Ki Jai was for those mindless trollers who constantly ask for proof of your patriotism.

Nah, I just know how to write. Sorry, I skimmed your post and missed that.

Never called it anti-national. Though some leader's behaviour does tend towards it, for instance, Mani Shankar bitching about Modi in Pakistan.




&gt;&gt; The ones that called congress antinational though, did not change their subversive antinational agenda of Hindu Rashtra




BJP didn't exist at the time. Organizations evolve over time. I personally don't give about a shit about the Hindu Rashtra hopefuls, but I don't consider it anti-national, or even anti-minority. Its just semantics. Akhand Bharat, Hindutva, etc are all semantics. Bhagwat takes Hindu as meaning anyone who lives in Hind, which is the old name for India. That's how the word Hindu came to be. Therefore, its a cultural, rather than a religious thing. But cut through all the bullshit, and its just semantics.



From Wikipedia:



&gt;&gt; The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time. Starting with the Persian and Greek references to India in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era,[3] the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in Indian subcontinent around or beyond Sindhu (Indus) river





&gt;&gt; is anticonstitutional.



In a democracy, you have completely rights to have an opinion that the constitution should be modified.

What is the point of improving the economy if you are going to hand it over to someone else and not your civilizational heirs?

Its imperative to have a big economy and have appropriate control over it. 

I think its shortsighted and dangerous to just focus on the size and ignore the control. 

Especially in a 1000 year outlook, India and China are historically and will continue to be (ignore the 200 odd year era of colonialism) the biggest economies in the world. Its the natural equilibrium.

So its equally important (if not more) to focus on who controls the economy. Even if its means that the recovery to a natural state (reversing the effect of colonialism) will be a little slower.

In the 1000 year outlook, we would do well to focus on control. Unfortunately, the current elitist class of Indians (who became elite due to collaboration with the colonial powers) lack the 1000 year vision and perspective.

Opposition parties were quick to raise fingers accusing the BJP of using the issue for political benefits ahead of the UP elections. (Source: File) Opposition parties were quick to raise fingers accusing the BJP of using the issue for political benefits ahead of the UP elections. (Source: File)

Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Union Minister Mahesh Sharma’s visit to Ayodhya ahead of the Uttar Pradesh elections has raised the question whether the BJP is trying to stir the fiery issue of rebuilding Ram Mandir in Ayodhya – believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama.

Sharma, a Lok Sabha MP representing the Gautam Budh Nagar constituency in UP, apparently visited the city to inspect the site for a Ramayana museum. Opposition parties were quick to raise fingers accusing the BJP of using the issue for political benefits ahead of the UP elections. Sharma insisted that he was visiting in his capacity as tourism minister and that this visit has nothing to do with Ram Mandir or the elections.

Watch what else is making news:

Construction of Ram Mandir at Lord Rama’s birthplace–the site where Babri Masjid once stood–has been a long-standing demand of the Hindu community and that has been echoed by BJP leaders like Uma Bharti and Vinay Katiyar who have stated recently that “Ayodhya belongs to Ram”.

There has always been a demand to bring a law for the construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Voters expected that the BJP would act sooner after it got elected on the issue given the fact several of its tall leaders spoke passionately about the issue while campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections. Now that Uttar Pradesh is going to polls next year, the BJP is seeking to keep a hold over its Hindu vote base.

The Samajwadi Party also tried to gain brownie points recently by announcing to open a Ramleela Theme Park in Ayodhya. With the growing anti-incumbency, the SP is willing to use such a strategy to cut the BJP support. The BJP, therefore, can’t stay away from the discourse. The BJP is the biggest political stakeholder in Ayodhya and needs to show intent on the Ram Mandir issue to hold on to its loyal Hindu support. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stayed away from the developments for now.

Middleweight politicos in the party have been vocal in support of the issue. The recent developments give a hint that the issue will crop up prominently in the election campaign. Whether the BJP announces plans for the Ram Mandir or not, it will be expected to move on the ground as the issue holds strength to sway results either way across several states

126,"I don't think that's entirely true. CPCs interests are to keep them in power, which is of course applicable to any other political party in India but to a lesser degree because of the electoral process and law which is actually upheld. Consider Modi, without his track record in Gujarat, I doubt he would have ended PM or BJP would have won the majority it did. One of the articles I read before general election, as I recall, mentioned how workers returning home to UP and Bihar from Gujarat had already made their mind to vote for Modi. Of course, this effect alone cannot explain BJPs sweep, but it does help us understand a subset of it.

I think Indian politicians until recently hadn't found their mojo, what freebies did earlier is being replaced by better roads, better schools, etc. This is not to dismiss the value freebies still hold to win over  voters, but clearly other factors are dictating terms as well.

Economic progress at the cost of losing political footing will almost never happen. The elites wouldn't take measures necessary to implement right policies out of altruism. While I am not well read on China's economic rise, I do think economic reforms that were made along with brief US-China alliance were the result of political choices. It is telling, in my view, that the current economic tailwinds that India is experiencing is because of states increasing their expenditure. More and more state governments are confident that investing in infrastructure, education is a better way to stay in power. OTOH, parties that ruined state's balance sheets are being evicted out.",2016-10-19 21:56:12
127,"Focusing on Indian Global Trade Expectations

---

&gt;* As India continue to overtake China in largest population (currently estimated for 2022 by the UN), so to will the focus of global trade growth, say leading economists.

&gt;* As China begins to decline from world population percentage from roughly 18% to potentially 15% in 2050, so too will decline their expected world market trade share.

&gt;* While China's current market trading is doubtful to fall, the big change for global logistics networks will be redirecting focus, from a majoritively North Asian market to a South Asian market.

&gt;* The leading evidence to suggest this market increase is based around the current Indian Prime Minister's port and infrastructure development (such as the Chabahar port signing), as well as current trade data of North and South America where India has surged to become one of the largest sources of imports.

&gt;* Among other things traffic congestion and ageing populations worldwide are likely factors that will contribute to an increase in trade with India.

&gt;* Muslim activists and petitioners against the practice of triple talaq on Wednesday demanded that the Centre clear ambiguity over the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and issue its draft for the public to debate before taking any action.

&gt;* While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led governments stand on triple talaq  that it is not justified  in its affidavit in the Supreme Court is favourable, its move to initiate discussions and seek public opinion about a common civil code in the present scenario is an attempt to politicise and communalise gender justice-related issues, they said at a press conference.

&gt;* They claimed that the move would encourage All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which has vehemently opposed a ban on triple talaq, and its supporters to look at it as an attack on Islam, which would depict the BJP as a champion of womens rights, and the Muslims as a community unwilling to comply with the law of the land.

&gt;* She said triple talaq has been abolished by many Muslim-dominated countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, and questioned the AIMPLB about it.

&gt;* The activists and petitioners questioned the Ulema [scholars of Islamic law] on whether the Muslim-dominated countries that have brought reforms in family laws are guilty of violating the Quranic instructions, and on that basis, how does the AIMPLB defend its plea that triple talaq, halala and polygamy are an integral part of Islam.

In 1959, a Pakistani film-maker called Akhtar Kardar directed a film called Jago Hua Savera (The Day Shall Dawn), which brought together creative film-making talent across the Indian subcontinent the way it used to before Independence in 1947, and which is now fast becoming unimaginable.

The film was shot on location in what was then East Pakistan and what is now Bangladesh. The great Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz wrote the screenplay based on a story by India’s Manik Bandopadhyay. India’s Tripti Mitra acted in it with Pakistani stars; India’s Timir Baran composed the music.

The film tells the story of a poor fishing community near Dhaka. It was influenced by neo-realism, as were several other films in the post-independence era. It revealed the misery of that community, where the location, the language, the religion, and the geography were all marginal to the human condition and drama, which knew no boundaries. The film has recently been restored and shown internationally. It was to be shown at the Mumbai Academy of Moving Image film festival opening today (20 October). But in view of the “current situation”, a euphemistic description for the war hysteria and patriotic fervour in India, the organizers have dropped the film.

Indian surgical strikes are now directed at weeding out Pakistani cultural exports across the Indian landscape, or arresting Pakistani pigeons and balloons. The film producers’ association doesn’t want film-makers to cast Pakistanis in Indian films, or to use Pakistani technicians. The film theatre owners’ and exhibitors’ association has told its members not to screen films with Pakistani stars. This would affect Karan Johar’s film, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which is scheduled for Diwali release a week from now.

The industry is divided. One film-maker, Vivek Agnihotri, wants Pakistani actors to say at least a few words condemning terrorism, as if that would do anything to rein in cross-border terrorism. Another film-maker, Anurag Kashyap, admirably steps out to bat for Johar and questions the unfairness of critics who want Johar to apologize for making a film with a Pakistani actor, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was visiting Pakistan at the same time the film was being made.

The neo-patriotic mob that’s remarkably swift in defending Modi, began abusing Kashyap. The Union minister of state for home affairs, Kiren Rijiju, observed on Twitter: “A new fashion has developed in India. A student or a film person can put a question or speak against PM without any logic to get into news.” He got a fitting response online from someone who goes by the name of @brumbyOz: “Around the world this fashion is known as democracy.”

In democracies, people do ask their leaders questions, and the communication with the leader is not stage-managed, but a two-way street; it is a dialogue, not a monologue.

Meanwhile, Johar saw the writing on the wall and said he wouldn’t cast Pakistani actors in future in his films.

The attack at the army camp in Uri was tragic and suggested intelligence failure. A swift response from the Indian armed forces was inevitable. And yet, the way the incidents have been projected and exploited for political ends indicates a dangerous trajectory in Indian political discourse, with the neo-patriots insisting that the army and the political leadership should not be questioned. It makes India more like Pakistan, as the Pakistani novelist Mohammed Hanif argued in a fine piece in The New York Times earlier this week.

Retired officers fulminate on loud TV channels, a TV anchor dons a flak jacket and surveys a “theatre of war” as though one has been declared, another anchor’s shouting is so loud, it is as if he wants his voice to be heard in Pakistan without the aid of television sets and satellites, and the defence minister credits the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s teachings for the success of the Indian Army. Meanwhile, clashes and skirmishes continue at the Line of Control.

The neo-patriotic foot soldiers are doing their best to cut the ties that could bind the two nations. After cricketers and ghazal singers, it is now film-makers and technicians from Pakistan who can’t play or perform in India. These are the real consequences of such pseudo-nationalism. It plays into the more cynical game many politicians, clerics and religious leaders, government officials and commanders want—which is to restrict contact between Indians and Pakistanis within that elite group which has the most to lose if people from the two countries were to meet one another socially and discover how similar they are. Indeed, most Indians and Pakistanis meet each other in third countries, often accidentally, and are surprised by their commonalities. To be sure, there is much that divides them, but perish the thought of letting people discover what unites them.

By preventing people-to-people contacts—through culture, trade, travel, sports, and the arts—each side demonizes the other. In the 1980s, when Pakistani businessmen asked the Zia-ul-Haq administration why they weren’t allowed to trade with India more freely, an official frankly told them: “We don’t want a fifth column in Pakistan.” Trade and cultural links build on commonalities, and that’s what the pseudo-nationalists fear.

So long as the narrative is under their control, that day shall not dawn.

Sorry but no. This bill is essentially a 'farm liberalization' bill. The provisions in the said bill are meant to incrementally liberalize farm sector and rationalize farm subsidies all of which are important and much needed. But none of the measure will directly impact agricultural productivity something which fundamentally determines our capacity to ensure food security in the country. India is a world behind the likes of China in terms of production per hectare in all most all products section which clearly demonstrates unexploited opportunity before us. Modi during the campaign phase enthusiastically talked about ushering in 'green revolution 2.0' but while in the chair he has yet to take any step in that direction. 

From another article:

&gt; [In 2014, Modi arrived on the national political scene in this backdrop of stagnant growth and desperation in the agriculture sector. His rousing speeches in the rural areas during the last parliamentary elections naturally received an overwhelming response. Posing as the “CEO” the country needed, he raised hopes of bringing in modern technology to help the ailing agriculture sector. But, even after two-and-half years in power, nothing has changed. The ban on Bt brinjal continues. The only difference is that the influence of the anti-GMO civil societies has been replaced by similar ideological opposition from the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch and Kisan Sangh, organizations affiliated to the RSS—BJP’s ideological parent.

Dhaka:  
  China is set to sign off on loans worth over $24 billion to Bangladesh during President Xi Jinping's visit today, Dhaka's biggest foreign credit line to date that will help it build power plants, a seaport and railways.



Xi Jinping's trip, the first by a Chinese president in 30 years, is aimed at boosting China's involvement in infrastructure projects at a time when India is pushing investments of its own in Bangladesh, a country New Delhi considers its area of influence.



Japan, helped by India, has also got involved in Bangladesh, offering finance at low interest rates to build a port and power complex, sharpening competition for influence in the country of 160 million people.



China plans to finance around 25 projects, including a 1,320 megawatt (MW) power plant, and is also keen to build a deep sea port, Bangladesh junior finance minister MA Mannan said.



""Xi's visit will set a new milestone. (A) record amount of loan agreements will be signed during the visit, roughly $24 billion,"" he told Reuters.



Among the proposed projects are highways and information technology development, he said. ""Our infrastructure needs are big, so we need huge loans.""



China's Jiangsu Etern Co Ltd signed a deal worth $1.1 billion to strengthen the power grid network in Bangladesh, the company said on Thursday.



Beijing is especially keen to revive a plan to build a deep sea port in Sonadia which has been on hold for years, officials said.



The Chinese President is visiting Bangladesh on his way to a BRICS summit of the world's leading emerging economies in Goa.



His trip comes at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading efforts to boost ties with neighbouring countries, from Sri Lanka to Nepal and Bangladesh, by offering them a share of India's fast-growing economy.



Last year Prime Minister Modi announced a $2 billion credit line for Bangladesh during a visit to Dhaka, but China looks set to go well beyond that.



Zhao Gancheng, director of South Asia Studies at Shanghai Institute for International Studies, said both India and China supported development in Bangladesh, and that it did not have to be one or the other.



""I really don't think there is a zero sum game going on in Bangladesh between China and India. Bangladesh welcomes both Chinese and Indian investment..."" said Mr Zhao.



Bangladesh has backed Xi Jinping's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia and into Europe, seeing it as an opportunity to lift growth.



India has reservations about the plan, amid worries that it is an attempt to tilt the balance in Asia in China's favour.



""Beijing had also proposed an economic corridor linking Bangladesh, Myanmar, China and northern India, but New Delhi did not seem keen on the idea,"" Mr Zhao said.



""Bangladesh has an enormous need for investment, and I don't think it's going to become a site for strategic competition, a game between the great powers or a pawn,"" he said.

&gt;* BJP parliamentarian Varun Gandhi leaked crucial information about defence matters to arms manufacturers after being blackmailed with pictures of him with foreign escorts and prostitutes, Prime Minster Narendra Modi's office has been told in a letter.The complaint, dated September 16, is from C Edmonds Allen, a US-based lawyer, who says that Mr Gandhi was used by controversial arms dealer Abhishek Verma to disclose defence details to arms manufacturers looking to score contracts for India.

&gt;* Mr Allen says that as a member of a parliamentary defence committee, Mr Gandhi used his information to ""compromise national security.

&gt;* ""Mr Gandhi told NDTV, ""How can I respond to something so ridiculously nonsensical.

&gt;* The 36-year-old has told NDTV that he has not met Mr Verma in over 15 years, did not attend the parliamentary committee meetings referred to by Mr Allen, that any photos presenting him as ""honey-trapped"" are not genuine and that the allegations being made may be intended at preventing a role for him in the Uttar Pradesh election (some BJP workers are believed to be in favour of Mr Gandhi being named the party's presumptive Chief Minister).The partnership between Mr Allen and Mr Verma collapsed in January 2012 with the pair swapping accusations of money-laundering, siphoning and cheating.

&gt;* Mr Allens then provided a steady supply of papers against Mr Verma to Indian investigators.Mr Verma was jailed and investigated in several cases including what is known as the Navy War Room leak which centred on the selling of sensitive naval secrets by a group that included serving and former military officers.

New Delhi:  
  BJP parliamentarian Varun Gandhi leaked crucial information about defence matters to arms manufacturers after being blackmailed with pictures of him with foreign escorts and prostitutes, Prime Minster Narendra Modi's office has been told in a letter.



The complaint, dated September 16, is from C Edmonds Allen, a US-based lawyer, who says that Mr Gandhi was used by controversial arms dealer Abhishek Verma to disclose defence details to arms manufacturers looking to score contracts for India. Mr Verma and Mr Allen were business partners before they had an epic falling out in 2012. Mr Allen says that as a member of a parliamentary defence committee, Mr Gandhi used his information to ""compromise national security.""



Mr Gandhi told NDTV, ""How can I respond to something so ridiculously nonsensical. Is there any proof of any of these allegations ? What is the proof of any of this ?"" The 36-year-old has told NDTV that he has not met Mr Verma in over 15 years, did not attend the parliamentary committee meetings referred to by Mr Allen, that any photos presenting him as ""honey-trapped"" are not genuine and that the allegations being made may be intended at preventing a role for him in the Uttar Pradesh election (some BJP workers are believed to be in favour of Mr Gandhi being named the party's presumptive Chief Minister).



The partnership between Mr Allen and Mr Verma collapsed in January 2012 with the pair swapping accusations of money-laundering, siphoning and cheating. Mr Allens then provided a steady supply of papers against Mr Verma to Indian investigators.



Mr Verma was jailed and investigated in several cases including what is known as the Navy War Room leak which centred on the selling of sensitive naval secrets by a group that  included serving and former military officers. Mr Verma was given bail in 2008 in this case.

A movie on Indian Army’s recent surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) is coming soon. Who’s making it? Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the head of Dera Sacha Sauda headquartered in Sirsa (Haryana); better known as ‘MSG’.

“I am going to start ‘MSG The Lionheart: Hind Ka NaPak Ko Jawab’. In the film, I will highlight the current situation of our country and answer even those who are asking to prove the surgical strike. Hopefully, we will complete the film within 25 days,” he said. In the title, the word ‘Napak’ being an apparent play on Pakistan and also the words ‘Pak’ (Urdu for pious) and ‘Napak’ (sinister).

He shared the movie plan in response to a journalist’s query in Mumbai after the success bash of his third and latest movie, ‘MSG The Warrior: Lion Heart’, which has earned Rs 176 crore so far, according to dera spokesman Aditya Insan. Aditya said the dera head did not name any country, but used the word ‘Napak’.

The movie’s nationalistic flavour is a continuation of what the sect head has been portraying in his earlier movies. While the first two movies had an element of nationalism and also songs featuring him flying the Indian flag, the latest movie in theatres now portrays him as a “top secret agent” who is fighting for the country and the world.

The dera had backed the BJP in the Haryana assembly polls and Gurmeet is playing to the gallery of hyper-nationalism that has found currency under the Narendra Modi-led central regime. This also comes at a time when a rape case against Gurmeet is at the final stages in Panchkula, 14 years after the FIR was registered. He is facing charges in other cases too, including those of murder.

“The film revolves around the terrorists and jawans (soldiers). It will also talk about the surgical strikes,” he said. The surgical strikes came after the September 18 cross-border terror attack on an army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, in which 19 Indian soldiers died.“We are losing our jawans so often. How many of us care about them? Suddenly some people have started asking for proof. It hurts me and I thought to reply them through my film,” he said.The movie is likely to hit theatres in the next quarter, the spokesman said.

On Pakistani artistes working in India, the dera head said Pakistan has become “synonymous with terror”. “It is very difficult to swallow that anything they do will be well-intentioned; there is plenty of talent in India. India does not persecute or torture; asking them to work in Pakistan is a fair thing,” a statement read.

170,"#Searching for Dalits: A yatra by Buddhist monks taking BJP to Dalits across UP

___





Ahead of Uttar Pradesh polls, a yatra by Buddhist monks across the state is perhaps the party’s biggest Dalit outreach at a time when it battles a backlash



The Dhamma Chetna Yatra is on its way to Mathura. Suddenly, the first car of the convoy stops near Raya town. Former local BJP MLA Ajay Kumar Poiya steps down, signals the convoy to stop, and approaches a Buddhist monk in the car behind. “There’s an Ambedkar statue here. Let’s garland it,” Poiya says. Some 40 monks come out, pay tributes to the Dalit leader. Just three minutes, and the yatra moves on.



It is not a planned stopover, but there’s no taking chances with B R Ambedkar’s statues. These monks have either garlanded or inaugurated some 800 statues of Ambedkar and Buddha in the last three months, since the yatra began on April 24. It’s only the half-way mark.

On another afternoon, at ‘Shriji Lodge’ in Hathras, several BJP leaders are in a huddle. Their concern is that “unless every potential MLA candidate brings at least one bus each”, they won’t be able to get enough people for a rally in Agra on July 31. BJP president Amit Shah was to join the yatra that day, but cancelled his visit just two days earlier. The official reason was the change of venue due to waterlogging. However, party sources admit there was fear that Shah would face protests from Dalits.



The BJP has spent the past fortnight trying to contain the damage caused due to attacks on Dalits in Gujarat, and remarks by a senior Uttar Pradesh party leader against BSP chief Mayawati. With the attacks coming in the wake of other measures seen as anti-Dalit by BJP governments, its rivals have spotted a chink in the party armour ahead of the crucial battle for UP.



Now, the anger has started washing up against what is easily the BJP’s biggest Dalit outreach programme. The cancellation of Shah’s Agra visit followed last Sunday’s protests by Dalits at rallies of the Dhamma Chetna Yatra in Aligarh, Hathras and Mathura, when local BJP leaders were chased away.

The six-month-long yatra’s stated aim is to cover all the 403 constituencies of Uttar Pradesh, spreading the message of Buddha and Ambedkar among Dalits. Led by monks, it bears the name of the All India Bhikshu Sangh. But the BJP’s fingerprints are all over.



At the lodge strategising for the yatra are the BJP’s National OBC Morcha President S P Singh Baghel; a minister in the Rajnath Singh-led government in UP (2000-2002), Rambabu Harit; and former secretary of the BJP’s state SC Morcha, Ramveer Singh. The yatra was flagged off by Rajnath in Sarnath, was to be addressed by Shah in Agra, and is scheduled to end in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s presence in Lucknow on October 14.



******



“The programme was finalised after the Dharma Gurus consulted the PM. This yatra is sending the message among Dalits that while all other parties merely pay lip-service to Dalits, only the BJP works for Dalits and respects Babasaheb Ambedkar,” says Harit, also a Dalit.



The yatra’s coordinator, Shil Rakshit, has just returned from a quick visit to Delhi, where he met BJP leaders and visited Shah’s office. Rakshit admits they have “concerns”. “Dayashankarji (BJP UP vice-president Dayashankar Singh, who was removed after his remarks against Mayawati), made some statements. We want to ask the party chief about his views on this,” he says.

On July 24, monks of other factions had driven away local BJP leaders in Aligarh from a meeting after Dalits and Jatavs present there protested against “atrocities under BJP governments”.



However, for now, that has not dented the enthusiasm of this convoy, with at least 40 monks part of it at any given time. The convoy has 10 Innovas, a luxury bus, a truck with LED screens, besides the rath that L K Advani used during his Ram Janmabhoomi Yatra that catapulted the BJP to the centerstage in the 1990s.



Modi’s photograph adorns all the vehicles, including the rath. He also features on calendars of the Bhikshu Sangh, distributed by the monks in Dalit bastis, along with Ambedkar and Buddha. As the yatra halts at basti after basti and at Buddh Vihars (Buddhist temples), the triumvirate that is being projected is clear.



The 87-year-old monk leading the yatra, Mahasthavir Dhamma Viriyo, has been an RJD Rajya Sabha MP and was once acknowledged as their guru by BSP bigwigs Kanshi Ram and Mayawati.



At the Buddha Vihars, Viriyo sometimes donates a TV set, which is used to play a video with Modi’s message. The TV itself is generally given to Viriyo by a BJP leader the night before.



Only a few of the monks plan to be with the yatra all through, others join and leave midway. They rest for the night at accommodations arranged by local BJP leaders. The food is also arranged by district BJP leaders, who give the monks “dakshina” (at least Rs 100) after every meal. All the vehicles have come from Delhi, say the drivers.



At every halt, existing statues of Ambedkar and Buddha are garlanded, or new ones inaugurated. When the monks deliver short addresses to Dalits, chants of “Modi, Modi” ring out. The pamphlets distributed at the rallies have details of the projects the PM has undertaken to “restore the legacy of Ambedkar”.



The meetings attract a few thousand people every day. The BJP estimates they would have interacted with nearly 40-50 lakh people, almost all of them Dalits, by the end of the campaign.

(Source: Express photo by Praveen Khanna)



The monks don’t deny the BJP’s close links to the yatra, including in organising and guiding it. “Modiji is the first Prime Minister who has focused on Ambedkar. We are now spreading the word about what Modiji has done for Ambedkar and Buddhism,” says Sthavir Panditanand, among the most prominent monks in the yatra.



“Koi mai ka lal hai jo kahe ki wo Modi ko PM nahin maanta (Is there anyone who dares say that he or she doesn’t accept Modi as PM)?” thunders Panditanand, at a rally in Hathras. “Some people are encashing the cheque of Ambedkar. Only the PM is capable of addressing your problems. He is working for your Ambedkar mission. If you don’t embrace him, imagine what will happen to your Ambedkar, and what will happen to your nationality.”



Says a smiling Rambabu Harit, “Mayawati thinks she has patented Ambedkar. It’s not the case.”



******



By the BJP’s own estimates, Uttar Pradesh has at least 50,000 SC votes in almost each of its 403 constituencies, with the figure going up to lakhs in many seats, making up over 22 per cent of the total voters in the state. Over 60 per cent of the SCs are Jatavs, the sub-caste of Mayawati. Together with Muslims and Yadavs, SCs constitute around 50 per cent of the electorate.



In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when it won 73 of the 80 seats in UP with ally Apna Dal, the BJP had managed to secure 43 per cent of the votes. But at that time too, without winning a single seat, the BSP had got nearly 20 per cent of the votes, and the Samajwadi Party 22 per cent of the votes.



The BJP also knows that given how the vote share is split in UP, where a party can win an Assembly seat with just around 60,000 votes, slight differences in vote percentage can mean a lot. In the 2012 Assembly polls, the SP had secured 226 seats at 29 per cent votes, while Mayawati with 26 per cent votes could get only 80 seats. The BJP was a distant third with 15 per cent votes and 47 seats.

They halt at Dalit bastis and talk about the steps taken by the Modi government for their upliftment. “Modiji is the first PM who has focused on Ambedkar,” says one of the senior monks, Sthavir Panditanand.

The BJP fears that the Modi magic won’t work this time. Muslim votes are out of the question while Yadavs are expected to stick with the SP. Hence, the BJP feels, its only hope to increase its vote share lies in Mayawati’s support base.

172,"#No discussion on withdrawal of Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan: Nirmala Sitharaman

The government has so far not discussed the issue of withdrawal of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday. India, she said, had extended the MFN status to Pakistan as a “goodwill gesture” way back in 1996 but unfortunately the neighbouring country has not yet extended the same to New Delhi.

“On the issue of the withdrawal of MFN from Pakistan, strictly speaking, that has not yet been discussed,” she told reporters here.

The decision to withdraw the status or not will have to be taken by the government and “I cannot comment on that”, she added.

Last month, government had decided to review the MFN status given to Pakistan at a meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the meeting was postponed.

The review decision was taken in the wake of the Uri attack. India also considered the option of dragging Pakistan to WTO over non-extension of the status.

The neighbouring country has missed its own deadline of December 2012 for giving India this tag.

As per the global trade norms, member countries of the WTO are required to give non-discriminatory market access as part of the MFN status to each other.

The bilateral trade between the countries stood at USD 2.61 billion in 2015-16. Talking about increasing imports from China, the minister said there is no instrument to completely stop imports from one country.

It is impossible to completely ban imports from one country, she added. “But if one wants to restrict the imports because that country is giving more subsidy or on quality issue, then we have instruments like we can impose anti-dumping duties or safeguard measures,” she added.

India has time and again raised the issue of widening trade deficit with China.

In her meeting with Chinese Vice Minister for Finance and Commerce Wang Shouwen, Sitharaman has asked for providing greater market access for Indian products there.

China has assured India that it will act on the concerns expressed by India. In 2015-16, India’s exports to China were USD 9 billion, while imports were USD 61.7 billion, leaving a huge trade deficit of USD 52.7 billion.

  JAIPUR: Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi today claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann Ki Baat' programme was inspired by Rahul Gandhi who started a dialogue with youths in 2004.  

 

  ""It was Rahul Gandhi's initiative to engage in dialogue with youths in 2004, which was copied by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and he came up with the idea of 'Mann Ki Baat' radio programme. He did not do such thing when he was Gujarat chief minister,"" Joshi said at a press conference here.  

 

  She alleged that the programme has delivered no result and has failed in influencing people as they have now understood that the government has betrayed them.  

 

  Speaking on the status of education and government's work in the sector in the last year, Joshi accused HRD Minister Smriti Irani of ""shattering"" the education structure.  

 

  ""Instead of strengthening the educational structure, the HRD ministry under Smriti Irani has spent more time in demolishing institutions of prestige, downsizing motivated educationists and scholars because they want RSS ideologues to head such institutions,"" Joshi said.

New Delhi: Acknowledging that India’s manufacturing sector is in “trouble”, Union minister Anant Geete on Thursday exhorted companies to counter the challenge posed by the growing Chinese clout by selling products at globally competitive prices.

“India’s manufacturing sector is in trouble for last many years. In the era of globalisation, competing in international markets has become a challenge for the country’s private as well as state-owned firms,” the Union heavy industries minister said at an Assocham conference. “If we fail to compete globally, we will get isolated. We have to compete with China, which has occupied a dominant place in markets worldwide. We need to accept this challenge.”

The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)—a gauge of manufacturing performance—fell to 52.1 in September from 52.6 in August, indicating that growth in the sector lost some momentum.

“It is the government’s responsibility to safeguard the interests of the country’s private and public sector firms. We have to sell products in global markets at competitive prices,” Geete said.

Citing the example of India’s steel industry, the minister said it had been facing problems for the last 2-3 years and a minimum import price (MIP) for steel had to be ascertained as finished goods from China started coming in at a price at par with India’s raw material cost.

The government had in February fixed an MIP of up to $752 per tonne on certain steel products to protect domestic players from cheap imports. In August, it extended the MIP on 66 steel products for two months as against 173 items earlier.

There will be no strategic sale in any company (which falls under the department of heavy industry) during the current financial year. The government is taking all factors into account while taking a decision on strategic sale of a firm.

The Cabinet in September cleared strategic disinvestment of Allahabad-based Bharat Pumps and Compressors Limited (BPCL). It is the first public sector unit (PSU) to be put up for strategic sale by the Narendra Modi government, setting in motion the process for privatisation of the PSU.

Strategic disinvestment denotes sale of substantial portion of government shareholding in identified central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), up to 50% or more, along with transfer of management control.

The Centre has set a target of Rs.20,500 crore from strategic sale in loss-making and sick PSUs this fiscal.

However, according to officials, it is unlikely that even the process of majority stake sale in Bharat Pumps will be completed in the current financial year.

New Delhi:  
  BJP parliamentarian Varun Gandhi leaked crucial information about defence matters to arms manufacturers after being blackmailed with pictures of him with foreign escorts and prostitutes, Prime Minster Narendra Modi's Office has been told in a letter.



The complaint, dated September 16, is from C Edmonds Allen, a US-based lawyer, who says that Mr Gandhi was used by controversial arms dealer Abhishek Verma to disclose defence details to arms manufacturers looking to score contracts for India. Mr Verma and Mr Allen were business partners before they had an epic falling out in 2012. Mr Allen says that as a member of a parliamentary defence committee, Mr Gandhi used his information to ""compromise national security.""



Mr Gandhi told NDTV, ""How can I respond to something so ridiculously nonsensical. Is there any proof of any of these allegations? What is the proof of any of this?"" The 36-year-old has told NDTV that he has not met Mr Verma in over 15 years and did not attend the parliamentary committee meetings referred to by Mr Allen, that any photos presenting him as ""honey-trapped"" are not genuine. He said that the allegations being made may be intended at preventing a role for him in the Uttar Pradesh election. Some BJP workers are believed to be in favour of Mr Gandhi being named the party's presumptive Chief Minister.



Mr Verma, in a statement, said he rejects ""the salacious allegations"" made in the letter of complaint and that he  neither had Mr Gandhi photographed, nor blackmailed him.

The partnership between Mr Allen and Mr Verma collapsed in January 2012 with the pair swapping accusations of money-laundering, siphoning and cheating. Mr Allen then provided a steady supply of papers against Mr Verma to Indian investigators.  



Mr Verma was jailed and investigated in several cases including what is known as the navy war room leak which centred on the selling of sensitive naval secrets by a group that included serving and former military officers. Mr Verma was given bail in 2008 in this case.

It will be miracle if Mum-Ahd doesn't become profitable by the end of 50 years.   

As another comment of mine in this thread listed, the project is going to see almost 4 fold increase in capacity (trains, trips, cabins, etc) over its 5 decade loan phase. The study accounted for demographics, population growth, population aggregation along the line (as usually happens when such projects get made), etc.   

Its a project which is being done with proper processes and professionalism and taking into account technical details. IF ever a State is going to spend its money and make something for the people on a large scale, there are worst ways to go about things than what is happening with this. 

It might not work, of course, it might fail spectacularly and Japan just says fuck it. But if we don't try we won't know or learn. At least the trying phase is being done throughly for the time being. Lets see how it goes before we cast a judgment on it.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is planning a Rs.21,000 crore package of state aid for India’s solar panel manufacturing industry, according to two officials.

The so-called Prayas initiative, short for “Pradhan Mantri Yojana for Augmenting Solar Manufacturing,” a central-government plan designed to lift India’s installed photovoltaic capacity as well as to create an export industry, according to two senior government officials with direct knowledge of the plan. They asked not to be identified because the policy isn’t yet public.

Modi wants to raise renewable capacity to 175 gigawatt by 2022 from 45 gigawatts at present. In addition to meeting its own energy targets, which Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates may cost $200 billion, India wants to emulate industrial developments in neighbouring China, where solar manufacturers have created a world-leading export industry.

The Prayas programme, part of Modi’s ‘Make in India’ campaign, is intended to create 5 gigawatts of photovoltaic manufacturing capacity from 2019 and build 20 gigawatts of projects in the country by 2026, according to the officials. The policy, which is being developed by the ministry in charge of renewable energy and industrial policy, along with the Niti Aayog government research group, will be presented to the finance ministry within a month before going to the cabinet for final approval, they said.

Catching China

Last month power minister Piyush Goyal said in Mumbai that a policy to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment is in works. When reached on phone, the spokesman for the power and renewable energy ministries declined to comment.

India has become one of the biggest clients of Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers and in the absence of its own domestic capacity, that reliance could potentially grow. In the first six months of 2016, India imported 18% of China’s production worth $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

India’s policy proposal, expected to create thousands of jobs, is also in response to the industry’s demand for help to the country’s solar manufacturers, one official said, adding that multiple tenders of a few hundred megawatts each would be issued for the manufacture of everything from wafers to modules.

Price advantage?

The government could offer about Rs.90 lakh a megawatt for manufacturing tenders and Rs.50 lakh a megawatt for local deployment, according to one of the officials, who said the numbers are subject to change.

The plan “might give a price advantage” if the manufacturing-hub logistics are “well planned,” according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Jenny Chase. Money alone isn’t a sufficient incentive for companies to set up the most high-tech automated factories needed to compete, she said.

Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. told Bloomberg News last month it’s considering a manufacturing joint venture in India that could produce the solar panels needed to meet Modi’s energy targets.

“To build large-scale manufacturing efficiency matching Chinese economics of scale will require government support,” Manoj Kohli, executive chairman of SB Energy said in an interview in New Delhi. He described Indian support policies in an “evolution stage.” Bloomberg

193,"The Modi hatred with this comment thread is strong. Modi govt is not completely blameless either. Looking at a few posts and their comments on r/india, it seems there some kind of agenda. Let me clarify a few points:

&gt; MP banned eggs

True and so did many other BJP ruled states and some Congress ruled (Karnataka does not provide eggs in midday meals and my state Jharkhand is BJP ruled but still provide eggs in midday meals) [Source](http://scroll.in/article/731585/not-just-madhya-pradesh-denying-eggs-to-malnourished-children-is-common-in-bjp-run-states), this has nothing to do with central govt, health is a state subject at this level.

&gt; Central govt decreased spending on health and education

True and false. Total spending increased YoY but the share as percentage of GDP decreased due to two reasons, one, large part of annual budget now goes to state, so more and more responsibility is transferred from centre to state (decentralization of responsibilities) and the other being prioritization of resources, we still need a huge defence budget (under central purview), a huge railway budget (under central purview) and money for other large scale infrastructure development. If you have read the budget links linked by u/bhiliyam and if you are little bit paranoid you might see trickle down economics at play, which is never a good idea but that's how capitalism works in India.

&gt; Decrease population

No this does not solve anything. Efficient distribution of resources is what we need. the best Korea is a bad example, I have no idea how they were able to get data from this country and even Iran and how reliable is the data from these countries?

Stop blaming Modi govt for everything (saala aaj tatti nahi hua, isme bhi modi ka haath h), ask your local MLA what they are doing to distribute grains in your district. Every district gets a budget (and sometimes emergency fund if the problem is really serious) specifically for this purpose. This problem is a prime example of grass root issues in India, centre can only do so much. The problems that majority of randians are not aware of (maybe because most of them are NRIs or living in posh colonies in the metros):

1. Missing anganwadi workers and teachers. Most elementary and primary school in India have fewer teachers than minimum required and even they dont come to school often, parents have no forum to register their grievances. There is only one anganwadi worker and one assistant for each rural primary school, so if she is on leave, nobody is there to cook
2. Parents not allowing their children to eat protein rich diet due to religious or social reasons, see the latest case of a kid dying from fasting. anganwadi workers are generally SC/ST, parents from high caste do not allow their kids to eat meal cooked by them
3. Corruption at district hospital, the doctors simply do not care to report malnutrition cases to the District Collector
4. Anti corruption bureau is undermanned and overworked to catch these corruptions
5. Police, block officer and Secretariat do not care and again no forum to complaint these carelessness.

I hope somebody reading this would just not get into the propaganda war but understand the real cause of this problem. Everything bad cannot be blamed to Modi. If you are concerned, go talk to your block officer and see what they are doing and how you could help, you could even volunteer to cook a meal in case any anganwadi worker is on leave, Akshay Patra foundation does this but they are religious, you could become the voice of reason.

Highlights 1 Pakistani analyst confirms surgical strikes by Indian army in PoK.

2 Pakistan is to be blamed for cross LoC operation by India, said Munir Saami.

3 There is little support for Pakistan among international community, Saami said.

Noted Pakistani political analyst Munir Saami has confirmed that India carried out surgical strikes in PoK. In an interview to a Canadian news channel, Saami said that denial by Islamabad is meaningless in this context.

Saami said, ""If they (Pakistani establishment) admit to the surgical strikes carried out by India, it would be difficult for them to explain the situation to the people of Pakistan.""

""How will they tell the people that Indian army crossed the LoC? It's like a bone stuck in their throat. They want to take it out, but it's difficult for them to do so and that's why they are saying that the surgical strikes did not take place,"" Saami told the news channel.

He further said, ""Whatever happened at the LoC was unprecedented. India had never carried out an incursion into Pakistani areas. If India starts doing it regularly, it would exhaust Pakistan.""

'WE HAVE LOST FOUR WARS'

Saami sounded a note caution for the government of Pakistan. He said that Pakistan had already lost four wars with India. ""If there is another war, Pakistan will be responsible for this. The two nations should desist from war as it would be detrimental to both,"" he said in his interview.

The noted analyst rejected the suggestion that Pakistan was a big nation. ""I don't agree with the suggestion that Pakistan is a big country. It's not. It's a small nation in all aspects.""

""This small nation is playing a gamble in Kashmir. It played four such gambles in the form of wars and lost in every war,"" Saami said before adding, ""We lost in 1948, 1965, 1971 and also had to pull back in Kargil.""

Pakistan does not play gamble with its own money, rather it borrows money for this, Saami lamented.

Noted Pakistani analyst Munir Saami during his interview with a Canadian news channel.



LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR PAKISTAN

According to Saami, Pakistan was in a habit of losing opportunity to normalise relationship with India.

""India has initiated peace process several times, be it during Vajpayee's regime or recently when Modi-Nawaz held talks. But, every single Pakistan puts the obstacle of Kashmir. Look at the sequence of events, it is Pakistan, which raised the issue time and again,"" Saami said.

'MODI HAS POPULAR SUPPORT'

In his interview, Saaimi said that it was not business as usual with India now. Unlike earlier regimes, India looks aggressive under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said.

""Modi has tremendous support of his people. Earlier, India talked about peace only. (Pakistan supported terror outfits) would enter and bomb places in India. Now, they are saying we not soft anymore,"" he said.

READ: Surgical strikes in PoK: How Indian para commandos killed 50 terrorists, hit 7 camps



According to Saami, India's patience has waned out on the account of continued terror attacks launched from across the border. He said, ""What happened (the surgical strikes) this time was due to the fact that India suffered in Mumbai, Pathankot and Uri.""

""We started this story (of cross-border terrorism) and now we want the world to support us. Unfortunately, the world is not supporting Pakistan,"" Saami candidly said.

199,"&gt;India is making progress on the openness of its government but it needs to improve security and reduce political violence, a new report on the rule of law says.

&gt;The latest “Rule of Law Index,” released Thursday by World Justice Project, a Washington-based nonprofit, ranks India 66th among 113 countries.

&gt;The report, based on a survey of 1,000 people and local experts, looked into Indians’ dealings with their government, the police, courts and other state institutions in their day-to-day lives.

&gt;Compared with the same countries included in the study last year, India’s rank improved three places in 2016. However, once 11 more countries were added for this year’s survey, India slipped seven places to 66th. The 2016 survey compared 113 countries over six subject areas, including “constraints on government power,” “order and security” and “fundamental rights,” among others.

&gt;India’s average score for “open government” improved from 0.53 in 2014 to 0.66 in 2016. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made communication with citizens a priority, launching the engagement portal mygov.in in 2014, which allows citizens to make suggestions on key government programs.

&gt;India also scored better than last year in “constraints on government powers”–measuring the effectiveness of institutional checks on government power by the legislature, judiciary, and independent auditing and review agencies.

&gt;But the South Asian nation’s score declined for “order and security,” where it ranked in the “bottom tercile” with Uganda, Kenya, Afghanistan and Pakistan for “conventional crime, political violence, and violence as a means to redress personal grievances.”

&gt;India also did poorly compared with last year in safeguarding fundamental rights, including “effective enforcement of the right to life, rights of the accused and fundamental labor rights,” among others, said the report.

&gt;In South Asia, Nepal came 63rd, three places ahead of India. Pakistan was ranked 106th in the bottom eight of the global rankings. The country was judged to have the worst access to civil justice and to be the least orderly and secure out of the 66 countries ranked in the index in 2011.

&gt;The rule of law is important to the progress of countries, said Alejandro Ponce, chief research officer of The World Justice Project.

&gt;“In broad terms, a lack of rule of law discourages investment and economic growth,” said Mr. Ponce.

NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi-led regime promises sweeping changes in a host of areas, but one aspect in which it seems to have bowed to tradition is the caste composition of the council of ministers. Various upper castes, like Brahmins, Rajputs, Kayasthas and Vaishyas in the north or socially dominant communities that are for all practical purposes 'forward' like Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Marathas, account for 20 of the 46 ministerial berths. OBCs have 13 representatives, tribals six and dalits three.



Only three of the 46 ministers can clearly be identified as non-Hindus - Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a Sikh, and Najma Heptulla, a Muslim. Two others - Smriti Irani and Maneka Gandhi - are difficult to define by caste/community. What is interesting is how the caste mix changes across different levels of responsibility. Among the 24 Cabinet members (including Modi), 12 are upper caste, five OBC, two dalit and one a tribal. At this level, there is a marked dominance of the upper castes.



Move one step down and among the 10 ministers of state with independent charge, five are upper caste, four are OBC, none are dalit and there is just one tribal. Again, the upper castes form the biggest chunk, but OBCs are only a little behind them.



Among ministers of state without independent charge, the pattern completely changes. Of the 12, tribals and OBCs have four each, while there are only three upper caste representatives. There is a solitary dalit in this category. The somewhat larger presence of tribals in the council of ministers - 13% of the berths compared to just 6% when UPA-2 was sworn in - should not come as a surprise. Of the 47 ST-reserved seats in the Lok Sabha, BJP won 26 and its allies another two.



What is a bit of a surprise is the really low representation of dalits. With just three is the entire council, they have a mere 7% of berths, compared to a share of about 15-16% in the country's population. And it is not as if BJP or NDA did badly in SC-reserved seats. Of the 87 such Lok Sabha constituencies, BJP alone won 40 and its allies like Shiv Sena, LJP and TDP won another nine.



Even within OBCs, powerful castes like the Jats, Gurjars, Yadavs and Kammas are dominant in the ministerial berths, though MBCs like Kushwahas are also represented.

For all the 22 years of his young life, Ajith (name changed to protect identity) has had to hide his sexual preference for male partners. The management graduate, who works at a hotel in Chennai, comes from Kambam, a small Tamil Nadu village.

Ajith’s parents and younger sister are aware of his sexual orientation but he fears the abuse, attacks and ridicule he would have to face in Kambam as an openly gay man. But in Chennai, where he is less secretive about his orientation, he said, he feels much safer thanks to the support of the community organisations (COs) for men with alternate sexual identities.

A recent survey conducted across five Indian states by Swasti Health Resource Centre for 12 such COs has proved him right: gay men who seek peer support were far safer than those living with their parents, most often without outing themselves. The aim of the study was to get a better understanding of the profiles and needs of those who approach the COs for help.

Living with parents, afraid to seek help

More than half of all men who face physical violence (52.4%), sexual abuse (55%) and emotional torture (46.5%) were still living with their parents and mostly in the closet, according to the survey. The attackers, it turned out, are most often strangers, clients (in the case of male sex workers) and goons.

The likely reason for this is that it is tougher for men living with their families to seek peer support from other homosexuals. In contrast, the study found that those living with long/short-term partners or peers face very little violence.

Harassed, in multiple ways

The study conducted between April and October, 2015, covered Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. It found that of 8,549 respondents, 14% have faced some kind of emotional violence, 8.9% sexual violence and 9% physical violence.

Of those interviewed, 1,762 reported facing 2,795 incidents of violence–an average of about 1.6 attacks per person. Most of the violence is perpetrated by clients on male sex workers (39.4%), followed by strangers (24%) and goons (17.5%).

Read: How gay right is about every Indian’s right: A prince explains

In many families, there is severe pressure on gay men to marry. The survey found that 8.9% of respondents were married and 42.5% were separated.

How existing laws make matters worse

There are an estimated 3.1 million men who prefer sex with men in India, according to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS Report. HIV prevalence among this group in the country is 14.5%, according to this 2011 working paper by the Global Commission on Law and HIV.

Criminalisation of homosexuality makes it tougher for homosexual men to seek medical help for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). “Repressive legal contexts and pervasive social stigma can limit access for these men to appropriate services for STIs and HIV, including prevention, treatment and can even be life threatening,” the global commission’s working paper said. After being decriminalised by the Delhi High Court in 2009, homosexuality was re-criminalised in India by the Supreme Court in 2013.

On October 5, 2016, the union cabinet ratified the 2014 HIV/AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The long-awaited bill seeks to prohibit discrimination against persons with HIV and AIDS. But, as human rights lawyer Deya Bhattacharya wrote in her piece in Firstpost, “the bill does not elucidate on the legal dissonance between its provisions of non-discrimination and other acts and case-law that discriminate against sex-workers, homosexuals and transgenders”.

Violence in sex work

For men engaged in sex work, especially those with a high client load, the study found that the danger of violence is multiplied.

However, low income from sex work results in even higher prevalence of STI symptoms. Similarly, men with lower weekly client load (four or less) reported higher STI prevalence (8.3%) than those who dealt with more clients (4.3%). This could be because the lesser the men earn in total–from all work including sex work–the less likely they are to undergo testing for STIs/HIV.

How COs help

Men who face violence are most likely (41.3%) to not report if it is physical, less likely (39.8%) if it is sexual and least likely (32.4%) if it is emotional. Ajith said that, in Chennai, it is easier to seek police protection against violence through COs than as an individual.

“We can reach out to the network when violence occurs. If I am standing at a bus stop and if cops come to inquire, we can call our CO for help,” he said.

The study showed that COs provide a strong support system for respondents engaged in sex work and other professions. A total of 6,482 men or 75% are registered with COs. Most cases reported to COs relate to emotional violence (51%).

&gt; Journalists and bloggers are attacked and anathematized by various religious groups that are quick to take offence. At the same time, it is hard for journalists to cover regions such as Kashmir that are regarded as sensitive by the government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems indifferent to these threats and problems, and there is no mechanism for protecting journalists. Instead, in a desire to increase control of media coverage, Modi envisages opening a journalism university run by former propaganda ministry officials.

I feel these have all come up during the last couple of years, so it's almost like we are trying to grow as an economic power and also mess up our social fabric with all these issues. 

If you are a movie buff, there a lot of other industries that you might be interested in. Generally, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi languages seem to make really good movies. Not sure about the other industries, so cannot comment. Bollywood produces some good movies once in a while, like Pink recently.

Our foreign policy has improved a bit but even there we have fucked up  a few times. Job creation has gone down. 

I have always believed that each party has a core philosophy which it can't abandon. If abandoned, it will create a kind of identity crisis. BJP's core identity is reight wing Hindutva and no matter what they do, at the end of the day they return to it. 

&gt;What do you guys think of Bollywood?

I think Bollywood has gotten better. Yes, there are horrible movies dished out frequently but there is a group of new age film makers like Kashyap, Banerjee, Motwane etc who are making good stuff. I can't name you 10 movies for each year in 90s or 00s but for the past 6 years or so I have seen some really good stuff every year.

If you take movies on face value, you have to be an idiot. Yes, racism and sexism are deeply rooted in Indian psyche. Though being fair with regular features is a huge asset.

BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has called for boycotting Chinese good as a mark of protest against the eastern neighbour that blocked a bid to get Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar designated as a terrorist by the United Nations.

Beijing’s move on Saturday to extend the “technical hold” imposed in April came a day before it was to lapse, giving Azhar – an accused in the Pathankot Indian Air Force base attack in January – another six-month breather.

“Buying Chinese product is an indirect support to a terrorist country,” Vijayvargiya wrote on Twitter amid the growing tension between India and Pakistan following the terror attack at an Indian Army base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Uri.

In a series of tweets using a hashtag “BoycottChina”, the BJP leader said Pakistan has China’s support and extending any economic support to the eastern neighbour was akin to weakening the country’s internal security.

“Saddened” with Chinese good flooding the Durga Puja market in Kolkata, Vijayvargiya asked Indians to take a pledge that they will neither buy nor promote Chinese goods.

“Appeal to traders: No matter how cheap Chinese goods are, country’s security and prestige are more important that profit,” he said in another tweet.

The BJP politician from Madhya Pradesh said India was trying hard to isolate Pakistan but it was being consistently backed by China and it was time that Indians should stop buying Chinese product as a mark of protest.

Known for courting controversy through his tweets and public statements, the BJP leader said “India comes first” before anything.

China’s decision brings into focus its stand on terrorism, on which, it has repeatedly said the West has “double standards”.

Though Beijing argued on Saturday – as before in April – that its decision was based on facts and procedures, the latest step brings into focus the close ties between China and Pakistan, who consider each other “all-weather allies”.

The decision comes within days of the first ever counter-terrorism and security meet between China and India held in Beijing. It could also cast a shadow on the BRICS summit to be held in Goa later this month where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping will meet.

This decision coupled with China’s role in blocking India’s Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) bid earlier this year will continue to hamper bilateral ties.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a veiled reference to Suheldev in his Independence Day speech, hailing a king who protected cows and also used them in warfare by placing them in front of his army.

&gt;* However, they were rejected because of their secular stories, while Suheldevs fable fits perfectly into the RSS-BJP narrative  he is their archetypal Hindutva foot soldier, one who stopped the march of Muslim invader Salar Ghazi Mian, a nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, in Bahraich, and halted the Islamicisation of the region and safeguarded the Hindu dharma.

&gt;* Ghazi Mian is not perceived as an intruder but as a hunter who wanted to settle down here because of the beautiful environs, writes scholar Badri Narayan in his well-researched book, Fascinating Hindutva: Saffron Politics and Dalit Mobilisation.

&gt;* The Dalits and Backward Castes were said to be the communities that had contributed the most to keeping alive the cultural heritage of Hinduism in the long history of India. Heroic tales of Suheldev have been used as an instrument of communal polarisation, leading to tension and disturbance on various occasions in the past few years.

241,"&gt; Look at how any sort of dissent or doubt over the surgical strike was treated here. Any politician or journalist who showed a bit of doubt or asked for proof (which is the whole job of the journalists) was absolutely hated or called a traitor right here in this subreddit.

I think there is being an incredible amount of victim complex and misinformation by internet leftists and politicians over this. I am used to them writing our history books but it's too much when they try to rewrite the present as if we're in an alternate reality.

I've followed the entire 'surgical strikes' issue since it started. From the beginning the criticisms levelled at the doubters of the surgical strikes were always nuanced and making solid, if disputable points: 

-The army top brass is considered trustworthy and the DGMO wouldn't hold such a press conference for fake strikes

-As many defense analysts who were quoted said, releasing footage of the strikes could compromise the army's capabilities to the enemy.

-The media on their part already verified that the strikes took place with some investigative journalism and eyewitness accounts.

-Finally pointing out that the Modi government may be doubted but the army should be considered trustworthy and by dragging their reputation through the mud the critics were only being petty to score political points

When all these arguments over time undermined the critics' complaints suddenly they all started shouting hoarse *'We have a right to dissent! We are being called traitors! Anyone doubting is persecuted!'* when this is not true for the most part.

I'd say it was these opposition politicians and their supporters who are showing intolerance to listen to criticism and playing the victim card to cover this up.

&gt;* A Supreme Court bench led by Justice Dipak Misra on Friday asked the Centre and several State government to respond to a PIL petition seeking to declare cow vigilantes extortionists and put an end to their atrocities against Dalits and minority communities.

&gt;* The Supreme Court's intervention comes shortly after investigating officials found there was no evidence of cow slaughter by Mohammed Akhlaq, who was beaten and lynched last year on suspicion of storing beef in his house at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh.

&gt;* The PIL petition was filed in the Supreme Court by entrepreneur and activist Tehseen S. Poonawalla immedately after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had denounced anti-social elements in the garb of gau rakshaks for spreading violence against the down-trodden and destroying the delicate social fabric.

&gt;* The Dalits who were attacked at Una or at East Godavri were only doing their traditional profession of skinning the already dead cow to provide leather to tanneries... the menace caused by the so-called cow protection groups is spreading fast to every nook and corner of the country and is creating disharmony among various communities and castes, the PIL petition, filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi contended.

&gt;* The petition accused these State governments of shirking their duty by remaining mute spectators while videos of atrocities committed by these groups are circulated on social media to become instrumental in spreading more tension and enmity.

Alleging that the Modi government was trying to “impose” Uniform Civil Code on the Muslims, the Imam called all Muslims, as well as Hindus, Christians, Dalits and other communities to come together to oppose the move.

Alleging that the Modi government was trying to “impose” Uniform Civil Code on the Muslims, the Imam called all Muslims, as well as Hindus, Christians, Dalits and other communities to come together to oppose the move. “If Prime Minister Narendra Modi tries to abolish Quran, talaq or Muslim personal laws, his party will be finished… As many as 40 crore Muslims of India will teach them a lesson. Talaq is in the Quran, so nobody can abolish it,” Barkati said.

WHAT ELSE IS MAKING NEWS

He was addressing a protest demonstration in front of the Tipu Sultan Mosque at Esplanade, in which two Trinamool MPs — Sultan Ahmed and Idris Ali — were present. The dharna, which went on for around 40 minutes, led to severe traffic snarls. The shahi imam also called for a nationwide road blockade protesting the Centre’s move. A rally at the Park Circus Maidan would also be held, he said.

Speaking at the protest, Sultan Ahmed said: “Quran cannot be amended or abolished and talaq is already mentioned in the Quran… No government can interfere in the teachings of Quran, talaq or personal laws of Muslims.”

“There cannot be any uniform civil code in the country. It will disturb the unity of the country. Muslims in the country have been targeted and the Centre is trying to impose uniform civil code on the Muslims. We have inherited the law and we will not allow any interference,” he added. Asked whether it is his party’s view, the MP said, “This is not the Trinanmool office. You ask our party’s national spokesperson about it.”

Idris Ali, maintaining that “nobody will be allowed to amend the Quran”, said: “We will oppose any such move of the Centre and will stop anybody who will try to amend the Quran.” He appealed to all to join the conference to be organised by All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Sunday against the code.

Besides Ahmed and Ali, Trinamool leaders Ahmed Hassan Imran, Mohammad Kasim and Mukhtar Ali also participated in the event.

For the first time in India’s constitutional history,the Centre on October 7 had opposed in the Supreme Court the practice of triple talaq, ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims and favoured a relook on the grounds of gender equality and secularism.

First of all, thank you. Sorry I got a little angry (not at you, but at the situation). My comment about the chaiwalla was in general about how growth in the top end of the market trickles down very slowly in urban areas, while the inflation takes almost no time. It doesn't have too much to do with Modi, as in, he's not making it worse, but he's not really making it better either. The poverty (BPL%) and relative poverty is falling and has been doing so for the last decade but those numbers are masking the ground reality. You have to look at those numbers in the context of food price inflation. When those onion price hikes happen, even house and car owning families have to cut down.

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil poster at Regal. (Express Photo by Pradip Das) Ae Dil Hai Mushkil poster at Regal. (Express Photo by Pradip Das)

The Shiv Sena has consciously decided not to join the anti-Pakistan chorus against actors cast in Bollywood films to avoid what party sources said unnecessary competition with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). It also reckons that violence on the streets fuelled by anti-Pakistan sentiments will not auger well for the party, which shares power with the BJP both at the Centre and the state.

The MNS led by Raj Thackeray has taken the centrestage by voicing its protests against Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. The question that is being asked is, has the MNS succeeded in hijacking the “anti-Pak” agenda of the Sena?

“Our anti-Pakistan stand has always been based on patriotism. The MNS’s anti-Pakistan protest is for politics,” said Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant. “Moreover, our anti-Pakistan stand is known for the past six decades,” he added.

It was in September when MNS’s cine wing chief Amey Khopar issued an ultimatum to film producers, directors and theatre associations against casting and screening films with Pakistani actors.

The marked difference in the nature of protest between the Sena and MNS has been evident from Day One. While the MNS has resorted to protests, the Sena vents its anger against Pakistan in the in-house mouthpiece Saamana.

The Sena’s moderate stand on Pakistan is a clear departure from its past when Sainiks would dig up cricket pitches to stop matches with Pakistan and disallowed ghazal maestro Ghulam Ali’s concert in Mumbai. The list of Sena protests against cultural and sports events involving Pakistanis runs long.

“We are looking at the Pakistan problems in larger national and international context. Being a party in power in the NDA at the Centre, our concern was the Indian government should give a befitting reply to Pakistan after the Uri attack. Prime Minister Narendra Modi deserves appreciation for the surgical strikes across the Line of Control,” said a Sena Cabinet minister.

He said the surgical strikes sent a clear and loud message to Pakistan and the world. “Therefore, taking on individual actors as is being done by some section (MNS) is fine. Why engage in ugly competition with the MNS,” he said.

Earlier, in an editorial in Saamana after the Uri attack, the Sena said, “It’s time PM keeps his promise to teach Pakistan a lesson.” In another editorial, it had said, “Pakistan is a terrorist state. Why should efforts be made to declare it a terror state? The whole world knows Pakistan’s true colours.”

Instead, the Sena is concentrating on larger issues where it can score against the BJP, such as the local bodies’ elections.

On its part, the MNS is increasingly scouting for emotive issues to revive the organisation. The protest against Pakistani actors coinciding with the release of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has landed them that political space. But to what extent it would help them electorally remains to be seen.

MNS general secretary Shalini Thackeray said, “We will not compromise on films with Pakistani actors. We will continue our protest.”

This is an autumn of political windfall for Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In September she emerged as a champion of farmer rights after the supreme court upheld her decade-long stance and ordered that the entire land of the Nano factory in Singur has to be returned to the farmers. October and November are gifting her the opportunity to extend her support to another politically influential constituency -- the Muslims.

Significantly for the Trinamool Congress chief, both farmers and minorities form two of the most important bases that she has wooed throughout her career. Equally important, the opportunities have arrived when she is preparing to extend her appeal beyond the confines of her state for a bigger role in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Hear it in her own words. “We have to spread the roots of Trinamool Congress to Delhi. You have to take us to a position where we can serve the people from Delhi,” she said on June 21 speaking to party leaders and workers in Netaji Indoor stadium.

In fact, she kept lambasting BJP on almost every ‘Hindutwa’ issue from beef ban to cow census. On July 21, at a flagship party programme in the city, she said, “What I choose to eat is my own sweet decision, and none else has any say in it.”

In the 2016 assembly elections both the farmers and minorities voted for Trinamool Congress in larger numbers than they did in 2011. (Subhankar Chakraborty)

Mamata Banerjee’s plans for a national role were, however, evident on May 27, the day when she took oath for the second time as chief minister. All the prominent faces who can be members of the so-called Third Front -- Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Farooq Abdullah, Arvind Kejriwal and K Kanimozhi -- were present at the swearing in ceremony and later Mamata herself remarked that she will be happy to push the cause of a non-BJP non-Congress front.

It is against this backdrop that one has to consider her stand on the uniform civil code. Though she hasn’t uttered, or twitted, a word in support of the Muslim Personal Law Board, it is easy to decipher her support behind the agitation programme by three Trinamool MPs -- Idris Ali, Sultan Ahmed and Ahmed Hassan Imran -- protesting the Centre’s initiative of an uniform civil code.

“We will speak to the chief minister on this issue. She has always upheld the rights of the minorities not only in Bengal, but also in the country, in tune with the tradition of secularism in the state,” said Noor-ur-Rehman Barkati, imam of Tipu Sultan masjid, who is a confidante of Mamata Banerjee.

“It’s an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to move the focus away from development, and rake up communal issues before the impending assembly elections in a few states,” said Idris Ali, Lok Sabha MP.

Both Ali and Barkati, who led the protest on Friday, made it clear that they will launch their offensive against the Centre from Kolkata.

On Friday the blockade at Esplanade for about an hour by three Trinamool MPs made the party’s stand on the uniform civil code clear. (Ramkrishna Samanta)

“Political parties who are using a section of imams and such people to further their political aspirations are scared that they will lose control over a section of the masses,” Sidharth Nath Singh, national spokesperson of BJP, told HT.

Very few politicians have been able to swing both the major constituencies -- farmers and minorities -- in their way as the Bengal chief minister did in her career.

In the Bengal assembly elections of 2011, she managed to rout the Left mainly on the votes of both these segments swinging towards her. While her support to the anti-acquisition movements in Singur (2006-08) and Nandigram (2007-08) brought the farmers close to her, the Muslims who form about 27.01% -- 24 million in a state of 91 million -- of the population voted solidly for her.

Five years later the support base consolidated even further, leading to 211 seats in a house of 294.

It is quite obvious that the Centre will not take her sympathy to the MPLB very kindly, and will hit back. But then Mamata Banerjee can never be faulted for picking her issues recklessly.

When after coming in power in Bengal she extended sops to the minorities in Bengal like grants to imams and muezzins and homestead land for them, many political pundits predicted a backlash from the majority community. In reality, all sections voted for Trinamool in more numbers than in 2011.

However, this time she may need to do a deft balancing act, as a proposed uniform civil code is likely to hold some appeal to a number of Muslim women.

Vadodara: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the integrated terminal building at Harni airport, in Vadodara, Gujarat on Saturday. PTI Vadodara: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the integrated terminal building at Harni airport, in Vadodara, Gujarat on Saturday. PTI

Using the analogy of surgical strikes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday wondered what would have happened if the government had adopted similar strategy in the recent campaign against blackmoney, which unearthed Rs 65,000 crores. “We gave some time to those who had generated black money (to declare it). You will be happy to know that Rs 65,000 crore in black money came into mainstream with payment of tax and penalty.

“Now think, Rs 36,000 crore that was leaking has been stopped (by direct benefit transfer), and Rs 65,000 crore of black money is unearthed, together it is Rs one lakh crore. “And this Rs 1 lakh crore has been brought back without launching surgical strikes,” Modi said, invoking the term used for recent operation by Army against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

“If we do surgical strikes (in this area), you can imagine what all will come out,” the Prime Minister said. Modi said he has put up a sustained fight against corruption since he took charge. “Against corruption, without much publicity I have put up a sustained fight. Government’s assistance (now) goes directly in the bank accounts of beneficiaries, cutting out middlemen.

“Just by ensuring that right person gets the benefit and wrong person cannot take it, we have saved Rs 36,000 crore, which used to leak in the form of (subsidies for) gas cylinders, scholarship, pension,” Modi said. Modi, speaking at a camp to distribute ‘assistive devices’ to over 8,000 'Divyangs’ (disabled persons) here, also criticised past governments for not doing enough for the disabled.

After distributing aid devices to the disabled, the Prime Minister said, “Knowingly or unknowingly, this country has remained insensitive towards the Divyangs. “The government buildings only had facility for healthy persons. We launched Sugamya Bharat mission, so that government buildings, hospitals, platforms are built in such a way that they have access facility for the Divyangs.”

Previous governments did not do enough in this field, he said. “Governments in the past had also worked in this direction. But you will be shocked to know that since 1992, when work started in this direction, till 2014, only 56 such camps (for distributing assistive devices) for Divyangs were organised. After this government came, 4,500 such programmes were held,” Modi said.

“So far, 5.50 lakh Divyangs from across the country have been provided direct benefit. “In the central government, I came to know that 16,500 posts for Divyangs were vacant. I told my Ministers to fill up these vacant posts. I can say with satisfaction that 14,500 such posts have been filled up,” Modi said.

The Prime Minister also said his government had started work for having 'common sign language’, as at present different sign languages are used in different parts of the country. Referring to the country’s economic growth, he said India was a bright spot in the world. “Today in the entire world, one thing about this country is being praised. The world says that India is the fastest growing economy in the world. Be it World Bank, IMF or credit-rating agencies, the entire world says in one voice that India is developing very fast.

“Solution to all problems lies in development. Only through development can illiteracy, disease, poverty be removed,” Modi said. “Remember the days of 2014, or 2013, what were the headlines? They did this much (corruption) in coal, so much in spectrum. Since the time you gave me the responsibility, in two and a half years the news is (about) doing good for Divyangs, India’s progress in world economy and development,” Modi said.

&gt; * Still with the Congress in decline, losing its activism in party and government politics, the BJP inched its way up, recruiting opportunist politicians, wooing the corporate sector that then PM PV Narasimha Rao and then finance minister Dr Manmohan Singh had unleashed, removing major controls including industrial licensing in the Congress government in 1991.

&gt; * Of course, the Congress didn't do the minorities many favours.

286,"Here's direct quote from the article you linked:

""The Dadri [the place where Mr Akhlaq was murdered] incident and the protest against the Pakistani singer are sad and undesirable. But what is the role of the federal government in these incidents?"" Mr Modi asked.

He said the ruling BJP had ""never supported such incidents"".

""The opposition parties are highlighting these incidents and accusing the BJP of communalism, but in doing so, are they not themselves practising the politics of polarisation? The BJP has always opposed pseudo-secularism,"" he said.

Which amounts to ""bade bade deshon mein chotichoti batein hua karti hein.""  He forgets that central ministers and bjp mps were involved in inciting the morons, and they continued doing so even after the incident.

Even this weakass statement was long after the incident.

Now lets look at his [statement after the dalit incident in gujarat:](http://thewire.in/57065/stung-by-dalit-backlash-modi-calls-cow-vigilantes-anti-social/)


“I feel really angry at the way some people have opened shops in the name of cow protection. I have seen that some people commit anti-social activities through the night, but act as cow protectors by day”, the prime minister told an audience at a ‘town hall’ style interaction with an invited audience in Delhi on Saturday.

Some time after this statement, Minister Mahesh Sharma went on to star in the show of strength following the custodial death of one of the dadri accused. Custodial deaths should be protested against, but when one of  the original instigators of violence from his own government uses it to make further threats, as a PM, this man bears direct responsibility. But then, what do you expect from [the man whose election speeches included cow vigilantism?](https://youtu.be/Nds_d3jwsa8)

On Facebook and Whatsapp, we only talk to people who think like us. Facebook, over time, customises your feeds based on your interactions that it will show you only stuff you will engage with. Or you end up with a Congress Facebook, a Dalit Facebook, a Modi facebook, a BJP facebook, a Commie facebook and so on. Seeing just opinions that agree with you 90% of the time makes you intolerant towards other things.

Whatsapp groups, where mostly you have people of similar thinking adds to it.

Then comes a large number of previously politically disinterested people, who believe their leaders are demi gods. Any serious follower of politics understands the tactics, strategies deployed by one's own and the opposing party and are realistic about it. The politically aware Congress supporter knows when his party has fucked up - the politically aware BJP guy knows what tactics the party is pulling. Newcomers to politics are clueless.

NEW DELHI: Asserting that his government has initiated far-reaching legal reforms, Prime MinisterNarendra Modion Sunday said it wants to create a vibrant arbitration mechanism as investors need to be assured that the rules of the game will not be changed arbitrarily and commercial disputes can be resolved efficiently.



An enabling alternativedispute resolution ecosystemis a national priority as it will not only add to investors' comfort level but also ease the burden on courts , he said, adding there is a need to promote India globally as an arbitration hub.



""Businesses seek assurance of the prevalence of rule of law in the Indian market. They need to be assured that the rules of the game will not change overnight, in an arbitrary fashion. And that commercial disputes will be resolved efficiently. A robust legal framework backed by a vibrant arbitration culture is essential,"" he said.



Addressing the valedictory function of 'National Initiative towards Strengthening Arbitration and Enforcement in India', Modi said towards this end, the government has initiated far-reaching legal reforms.



""Over a thousand archaic laws have been scrapped. We have enacted a comprehensiveInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code,2016, implemented theNational Company Law Tribunals, established a statutory Monetary Policy Committee and effected a merger of the commodities and securities market,"" he told the gathering which included Chief Justice of India T S Thakur and members of the judiciary from several countries.



The Prime Minister said creation of a vibrant ecosystem for institutional arbitration, is one of the foremost priorities of his government.



Recently, major amendments have been made to theArbitration and Conciliation Act. This has made the arbitration process easy, timely and hassle-free.



He said legal reforms can deliver desired results only when there is an effective and efficient dispute resolution mechanism. .



""The independence of the judiciary is a basic feature of the Indian Constitution. Common citizens as well as businesses repose immense faith in the integrity of the judicial process. Our government has taken various initiatives to improve the judicial infrastructure and administration,"" Modi noted.



He said the enactment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act for speedy resolution of commercial disputes is a step in that direction.



Modi said the government has been working on a strategy for convergence of existing tribunals. This will help transform the existing complicated tribunal system into a simpler structure.



""We need to simultaneously facilitate a vibrant ecosystem for alternative dispute resolution, including arbitration, mediation and conciliation. This will provide additional comfort to investors and businesses. More importantly, it will also ease the case-load on Indian courts,"" he said.



He said, today, corporates and financial institutions want legal experts who can help close business deals and transactions without any disputes and litigations. If a dispute arises, corporates want to resolve them quickly through arbitration, without going to courts. For this, they require specialised arbitration lawyers.



""India has no dearth of brilliant lawyers and judges. India also has a large number of retired judges, engineers, and scientists who can function as competent arbitrators in various fields. India's economic interests shall be better served by a higher number of arbitration experts and lawyers. This in turn requires widening the ambit of legal education in India. There is need to develop specialised arbitration bar associations,"" he said.



He also said there is a need to have professionally run arbitral institutions which can deliver international standards of services at reasonable costs to businesses in India.



Recent trends, he said, indicate that Asian centres like Hong Kong and Singapore have emerged as preferred arbitration destinations. As popular business hubs, they also rank high in the levels of Ease of Doing Business.



""Thus, availability of quality arbitration mechanisms is an integral component of Ease of Doing Business, to which our government is committed,"" the Prime Minister said.

311,"Muslims under Narendra Modi: The dark side to India's Prime Minster

---

&gt;* Not a single politician or civil servant was put behind bars, and there was not even an admonishment for the prominent figure many Muslims hold responsible for the bloodletting - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

&gt;* A long-serving member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Modi was chief minister of Gujarat at the time of riots which produced the worst sectarian violence since the 1947 partition that created the Hindu-dominated state of India and its Muslim counterpart Pakistan.

&gt;* However, numerous reports and witness accounts sketch a far more sinister picture: that the violence was orchestrated by a core of Hindu nationalist outfits, and the state authorities dominated by Modis BJP played a supporting role before, during and after the massacre.

&gt;* According to French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot, who has written extensively on the rise of Hindu nationalism: The violence in Gujarat, due to its very geographic scope and unbearable intensity, in fact marks the first example of ethnic cleansing targeting Muslims since India's Partition in 1947: the aim here was not only to loot and destroy private property, even if such events also took place, but indeed to murder and run off those perceived as intruders.

&gt;* The term intruders is crucial in understanding the shocking cruelty that was on display during the riots and leads us straight to the heart of Hindutva: the right-wing ideology that ideally aims to bring an end to the secular state of India by establishing Hindu hegemony.

313,"&gt;Traditional divorce mechanisms are not so easy. Most laws, (Hindu Marriage act. etc) require minimum 1 year separation + cause + alimony as determined by court.

Why shouldn't it be easy? Why should there be cause for divorce? Why should anyone spend years in courts for divorce? 

  

&gt;Presently this lady gets NO ALIMONY and NO COURT can do anything much for her. 

Danial Latifi v Union of India. They get alimony. 

http://twocircles.net/2015jun23/1435074268.html


&gt; are not realizing that the values are fixed by mullas and is generally in the thousands of rupees, one time cost, thus her alimony would be a few thousand rupees one time settlement.

Mahar is fixed by the bride. Not mullahs. Also Danial Latif judgement provides her alimony. 


&gt;NO Child Support for her either.

Source? 

I see no reason to make the divorce proceedings tougher. Islamic divorce is the easiest and the most progressive. Just extend it to women.

But I still don't see how making no fault divorce for both men and women solve this problem? She would still be divorced. In Hindu law since the divorce is so tough, men just desert their wives. Like Modi. And women get stuck in marriages and years pass by until they get divorce after they prove desertion. 


If UCC comes and no fault divorce is made the law, then also she would be divorced. Also about alimony, since the marriage was just for 2 years and her parents are still alive and she is supported by them, I really don't see alimony being a factor here.  Alimony becomes a factor only in long marriages(10+ years).

318,"#Will Modi’s target of doubling Brics trade by 2020 materialize?

___

[IMAGE](http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2016/10/22/Photos/Processed/brics3-k2PF--621x414@LiveMint.jpg)

___

On the concluding day of the 8th Brics Summit in Goa last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon leaders of the group of emerging economies to double the size of the intra-bloc trade to $500 billion by next five years.

“In 2015, intra-BRICS trade stood at about $250 billion. We should set ourselves a target to double this number to $500 billion by 2020,” Modi said addressing the leaders’ plenary. Read More

A look at historical intra-Brics trade data suggests that the target is unlikely to materialise. Here’s why. For intra-Brics trade to increase to $500 billion by 2020, it would have to grow at a minimum of 12.7%. But between 2006 and 2015, annual average growth in trade between Brics countries was at 10.1%. The historical data should be read with the caveat that South Africa became a member of the block in December 2010. What makes Modi’s hopes look even more far-fetched is the fact that intra-Brics trade has been declining over the last two years.

To be sure, the recent decline in intra-Brics trade should not be seen as a failure of the grouping alone. A comparison of intra-Brics trade and global trade shows that the two move in tandem with each other. Both intra-Brics trade and world trade growth have witnessed a declining trend in the recent years. World trade registered a slide of 13.3% in 2015 over 2014. Intra-BRICS decline in the same period was 17.3%. With the World Trade Organization (WTO) estimating subdued international trade growth in 2016 and 2017, the prospects of intra Brics trade may also get affected.

Matters are unlikely to improve in the near future given the fact that WTO’s recent projections for growth of global trade are not encouraging. The WTO revised its forecast of world trade growth for 2016 to just 1.7%, well below the April forecast of 2.8%. The forecast for 2017 has also been revised to grow between 1.8% and 3.1%, down from 3.6% previously.

It is to be expected that Modi’s call for increasing intra-Brics trade was made with India’s export interests in mind. Here too, the numbers are not very encouraging. India’s export to Brics countries has shown an average annual growth of approximately 4% between 2006 and 2015. In contrast, import from its Brics peers has recorded an average increase of almost 14%. As is to be expected, imports from China made up for over 80% of India’s total imports from other Brics countries in 2015. Between 2006 and 2015, China’s share of total Brics imports by India increased from 74.4% to over 80%.

To gain economically from the Brics, India would need to increase its international competitiveness rather than hope for a mere doubling in the intra-group trade.

  NEW DELHI: The Congress today latched on to the remarks made by business leader Ratan Tata, who had expressed concerns over ""intolerance"" in the country, with party leaders saying that doyens of India Inc were realising the source of this curse.  

 

  ""Intolerance stymies civilizational advance. Doyens of India Inc finally realize the source of 'curse of intolerance',"" Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted in a veiled attack on the Modi Government.  

 

  In another tweet, senior party leader Digvijay Singh also referred to Tata's remarks and endorsed them.  

 

  ""Spot on Mr Ratan Tata. Well spoken,"" Singh said in a tweet.  

 

  Yesterday, Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, Ratan Tata, expressed concern over the alleged growing intolerance in the country, dubbing it ""a curse we are seeing of late"".  

 

  ""I think everybody knows where the intolerance is coming from, what it is. Like many thousands, millions of Indians, one wants to see a country without intolerance,"" Tata told reporters late last night in Gwalior.  

 

  Minutes before, he had spoken against the alleged growing intolerance in his address at the 119th foundation day function of Scindia School here, endorsing Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia's views on the issue.  

 

  ""The Maharaja (Jyotiraditya) talked about intolerance. It is a curse we are seeing of late,"" the eminent industrialist had said in his address.  

 

  ""We want to live in an environment where we love our fellow men. We don't shoot them, we don't kill them. We don't hold them hostages but give a bit of ourselves and we give and take,"" Tata added.

&gt;* Apart from discussing the future work of BRICS, the Russian leader held talks with Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a wide spectrum of issues on the bilateral agenda.

&gt;* The recent negotiations between Putin and Modi showed that Indians are very close to the Russian perception of a multi-vector foreign policy and the countries often have the same or very similar approaches to any particular issue.

&gt;* This allowed some forces, especially Pakistani right-wing and obscurant groups working against the interests of the Nawaz Sharif government, to turn public attention to speculation that the drills would take place in the disputed territory of Kashmir.

&gt;* Of course, at the start, the Indian public reacted very emotionally, but Putins visit showed that the leaders of both countries understand each other very well and for them Russias interests in developing ties with Pakistan are quite clear.

&gt;* I think that a two-hour private meeting between Putin and Modi might have given an opportunity to explain specific points, touch upon sensitive issues in bilateral relations and on the global agenda.

NEW DELHI: After protracted negotiations, Russia has agreed tolease a second nuclear submarine to India+in a deal which will cost around $2 billion.



Sources on Wednesday said the deal was struck during themeeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin+on October 15 on the sidelines of the BRICS meet in Goa.



However, it was not part of the slew of announcements made after the talks.



The Defence Ministry and the Navy did not offer any information on the subject since it was a strategic platform coming under direct purview of the Prime Minister's Office.



Alexei Nikolski, a columnist with Russian daily Vedomosti, which broke the story, wrote, ""According to a source in the Russian defence industry, the long-discussed lease to transfer a multipurpose Project 971 nuclear submarine to India from the Russian Navy was signed in Goa.""



The Akula 2 class submarine is expected to arrive in Indian waters in 2020-21.



TheIndian Navyalready operates an Akula 2 class nuclear submarine,INS Chakra (formerly known as K-152 Nerpa)+, which was leased by Russia for 10 years and commissioned on April 4, 2012 after India paid for its completion of its construction and sea-trials.



India had been keen to lease a second nuclear submarine.



Indian defence sources had said that Russia had linked the lease of the nuclear submarine to theagreement for four stealth frigates+.



In Goa, India and Russia announced an over USD 3 billion frigate deal. Under the agreement, two stealth frigates will be built in Russia while the other two would be built in India under license production.



The Akula 2 class submarine, though not the latest class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines in the world, is still considered one of the most advanced.



Capable of sailing at speeds up to 35 knots (nearly 65 km per hour) under water, it is among the quietest Russian submarines.

Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and other international NGOs working in India had sought US government intervention after their funding came under increased scrutiny of the Modi government, according to emails released by the Wikileaks.

The emails, hacked from the email account of John Podesta, who is the chairman of the Clinton Campaign, also indicates the global funding links of these NGOs, including those environmental groups opposing a massive mining project in Australia being undertaken by the Adani Group.

“Adani is very close to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi -- so this will be a delicate diplomatic challenge,” Sergio Knaebel, grant director of the Sandler Foundation, wrote in an email to Podesta on May 27, 2015, months after he left the White House to be the Chairman of the Clinton Foundation.

Based out of San Francisco, the Sandler Foundation till 2015 had charitable grants of more than $750 million to various NGOs globally working in areas like environmental protection, labour, education, and human rights.

The Sandler Foundation among other things have funded the Sunrise Project, which is opposing Adani’s $21.7 billion mine project in Australia.

“The situation for NGOs in Australia is also getting pretty serious. The Abbot government has set its sights on organisations fighting the expansion of coal and for protecting the reef -- and is looking to withdraw charitable status and out foreign donours in an effort to cast the NGO’s work as foreign intervention.

“Same playbook as India (and Canada),” Knaebel wrote in an email to Podesta.

Podesta did not make any commitment, but forwarded to Knaebel a series of email exchanges he had with Karen Sack from Ocean Unite, another environmental group.

Sack is currently the managing director of Washington- based Ocean Unite.

Before joining Ocean Unite, she was senior director for International Oceans at The Pew Charitable Trusts where she helped initiate the Global Ocean Commission.

Before that, she was the Head of Greenpeace International’s Political and Business Unit and the Head of their international oceans campaign.

“What’s going on in India is concerning. There are some interesting linkages between the coal industry there and in Australia,” Sack wrote on May 27, 2015.

“Adani, the coal billionaire from India is the person who plans to invest in building a coal port just near the Great Barrier Reef, which has people up in arms down under.

“The fascinating thing is that some of the big banks are refusing to invest in the port development project because of the potential risks to investors from the uncertainty,” she told Podesta in the email.

&gt; * Now, instead of the sentences that included phrases like ""sexual health needs"", the only (oblique) reference to sex education in the final policy document is in the line, ""The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme need to be extended to all schools as early as possible.""

In the eyes of the world, India is perceived as the largest vegetarian country. Presumably, this impression is created by our best brand ambassadors from political, spiritual and yoga circles. Prime minister Modi is a strict vegetarian, fasting for nine days during Navratra, and the world wonders from where he gets his energy to remain active and productive. The popular yoga guru Baba Ramdev and many other Hindu religious leaders too, are vegetarians, and preach vegetarianism.

But what is the reality? To know this, we dig into India’s largest household consumption surveys, conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) over 1993-94, 2004-05 and 2011-12, each time with a sample size exceeding 1 lakh households, with a one-month recall period. We define non-vegetarians as those consuming either eggs or fish or meat or any combination of these. By this definition, 62.3% of Indian households consumed non-veg food in 2011-12, up from 56.7% in 1993-94, and 58.2% in 2004-05. So, the trend is quite clear—non-vegetarianism is on the rise.

Recently, however, a Sample Registration System Baseline Survey 2014 was released by the Government Census office, stating that 71% of Indians are non-vegetarians as on January 1, 2014. But this study covers the population of above-15-years of age only, whereas the NSSO includes individuals of all age groups. Hence, the two are not comparable.

Which state would you guess as the most vegetarian state of India? If you are thinking of Gujarat, the home of Gandhi and Modi, think again! While Gujarat has a 28% non-vegetarian population, Punjab has an even lower percentage (23%) of its population consuming non-vegetarian food. However, the most vegetarian state of India is Haryana, with just 19% non-vegetarian households, and has remained so since 1993-94, as shown in the accompanying map. Green shades in the map represent vegetarian-majority states, while red shades represent non-veg-majority.

A state-wide analysis shows North Eastern states (the Seven Sisters) had the highest proportion (97%) of non-vegetarians in 2011-12, followed by West Bengal (95%), and Kerala (92%). Haryana had the least (19%), followed by Rajasthan (20%), Punjab (23%) and Gujarat (28%). A sharp increase in proportion of non-vegetarians is seen in J&amp;K from 35% (1993-94) to 71% (2004-05), to 74% (2011-12), presumably due to the exodus of Hindus from J&amp;K during this period.

While the trend toward non-vegetarianism is clear, what is interesting to note is the “chicken revolution”, as the proportion of households consuming chicken shot up from 8% in 1993-94 to 38% in 2011-12, while the fish-eating households hovered between 30-32% over the same period. The proportion of goat-meat (mutton) eaters has fallen significantly, from 30% (1993-94) to 15% (2011-12), whereas that of beef and buffalo-meat-eaters has remained more-or-less constant at about 6% over this period. Interestingly, the proportion of so-called “eggetarians” (those consuming eggs only) has fallen drastically from about 24% (1993-94) to merely 3.5% (2011-12).

A structural change in the poultry industry by organised large hatcheries like Venkateshwara and Suguna, by mainstreaming small-holders, seems to have ushered in the “chicken revolution”. As a result, broiler meat production rose from less than 0.2 million metric tonnes (mmt) in 1991 to about 2.47 mmt in 2011-12, and egg production from about 24 billion to 66 billion by 2011-12.

Normally, rising non-vegetarianism is attributed to increasing incomes and resulting diversification of diets for better and higher protein-intake. However, the Indian story may not be as simple. Religious beliefs have played an important role in keeping meat consumption much below what corresponding income levels would have otherwise suggested.

For example, Kerala and Punjab are both prosperous states with comparable per capita incomes, but Kerala has 92% non-vegetarians and Punjab only 23%. Across states, correlation between per-capita incomes and non-vegetarianism does not yield any positive results. The spread of religious movements from Arya Samaj to Radhasoami and Namdharis in Punjab seems to have played an influential role in restricting meat consumption. It is likely that vegetarians consume more milk for their protein requirement. The proportion of milk-consuming households increased from 70% (1993-94) to 81% (2011-12). India is the largest producer of milk (146 mmt in 2014-15), although per capita availability (322 g/day) still remains low.

Internationally too, among countries with comparable or even lower per capita incomes, India has the lowest level of per capita meat consumption at 2.9 kg/capita per year in 2015, of which 1.7kg/capita is poultry meat, as shown in the accompanying chart. Pakistan’s annual per capita meat consumption is four times that of India, with a lower per capita income than India.

What do these numbers indicate for food and nutritional security? Indians draw only about 1% calorie-intake and 3% protein-intake from eggs, fish and meat. Given the high incidence of malnutrition in India, especially among children, this is somewhat concerning for nutritionists. Will government policy promote egg or meat consumption for better nutrition? The chances are dim. But if it reduces import duty on chicken legs from 100% to say 20%, it can give a fillip to poultry consumption. Meat consumption will increase primarily through private sector initiatives such as of KFCs, McDonald’s, etc, which can ensure food safety requirements. Modernised well-equipped abattoirs would also help, as they have in making India one of the largest exporters of buffalo meat. Milk and milk-products, however, can be promoted by cooperatives with support from the government.

Further, since chicken rules the roost, not pork or beef, the feed pressure will be much less in India, as chicken is comparatively a more efficient converter of energy, with feed-to-meat ratio of 1.6:1, compared with 5:1 for pork and 7:1 for beef. This, coupled with low levels of meat consumption, will keep feed demand subdued. While the trend is increasing non-vegetarianism, vegetarians are certainly more benign creatures as far as the environmental health of the planet is concerned!

Nitish Kumar’s equations with Lalu Prasad Yadav soured after the release of RJD leader and Siwan strongman Shahabuddin from Siwan Jail recently. (PTI)

Nitish Kumar, Bihar Chief Minister and Janta Dal (United) chief, has reportedly opened “channels” of communication with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to explore options to join hands together once again. The move comes amid Kumar’s reportedly growing rift with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav.

The Sunday Guardian reports “reliable sources” as saying that one of the senior JD(U) leaders, who is also a doctor, is meeting BJP leaders in Delhi to find a way to “reunion” of both the parties.

The said JD(U) leader’s father is a famous doctor in Patna, who had also contacted the General Elections from Patna Sahib constituency.

The source told The Sunday Guardian that JD(U) has watered-down its aggressive stance against PM Narendra Modi.

Kumar’s equations with Yadav soured after the release of RJD leader and Siwan strongman Shahabuddin from jail recently. Soon after coming out of jail, the convicted criminal-turned-politician had attacked Kumar, saying the Bihar CM was the “Chief Minister of circumstances.” Lalu had backed Shahabuddin and refused to take a stand against the former’s statement.

In a bid to defeat BJP in Bihar Assembly elections last year, Kumar had formed a ‘mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) with RJD and Congress.

The BJP has also warmed up to Kumar and JD(U). This was reflected when Kumar, along with JD(U) leaders Sharad Yadav and Harivansh were included in the 149-member committee formed to celebrate the birth centenary of Jan Sangh founder Deendayal Upadhyay.

Nitish agreed to become a part of the committee even as he has talked about making India free of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Upadhyay was RSS pracharak.

The combined strength of BJP and JD(U) MLAs in Bihar is 123, which is one more than the required majority.

Narendra Modi slams regional parties for UP's backwardness

The Prime Minister said that only BJP could transform UP into an 'Uttam Pradesh'

Prime Minister on Monday lashed out at the incumbent (SP) and previous (BSP) regimes for the alleged backwardness of Uttar Pradesh, particularly Bundelkhand region.

Addressing a public meeting at Mahobad district in Bundelkhand, Modi said while one party was embroiled in power struggle within the party, the other party was seeking power to resume their misdeeds; references to and respectively.

He maintained only BJP could transform UP into an ''Uttam Pradesh' even as he urged the people to break the cycle of power transfer between and in the state. He said underlined Modi was not born to rule, but to serve people.

Modi observed UP had given several PMs to the nation, including himself, and he wanted to do greater work that all the previous PMs put together.

The public meeting marked the launch of the election campaign of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in UP ahead of the 2017 assembly polls.

He was also critical of the role of the and governments in the state and alleged funds had been allocated for projects in Bundelkhand, yet nothing was done.

""The land of UP is our mother and we would not let the mother be fleeced anymore,"" he added.

The PM stressed Bundelkhand remained backward due to political failure of the previous governments, both central and state. ""Mafias rule the roost here and they get projects only on paper, while leaving people in the lurch.""

Modi observed the prevailing situation in UP was similar to 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when people had en masse voted for BJP, which had swept the elections to form government.

He urged people to send good wishes to soldiers and security personnel guarding the borders during the festival of Diwali.

Meanwhile, he lashed out at people tying to politicise the issue of 'triple talaq' and said the need of hour was to give equal rights to men and women, whilst not seeing the matter through the prism of Hindu or Muslim.



He noted that it was unfortunate some parties wished to deprive women of their fundamental rights. ""It is the responsibility of the government to give justice to women as enshrined in Constitution.""

&gt; * NEW DELHI -- According to the Narendra Modi government, using the word ""sex"" in a government document for framing policy on sex education for school students can ""offend"" people.

&gt; * Even though it is unclear who these ""people"" are, reported The Telegraph, the human resource development (HRD) ministry asked an expert panel making recommendations for new education policy to remove the word ""sex"" and ""sexual"" from the final government document.

&gt; * Now, instead of the sentences that included phrases like ""sexual health needs"", the only (oblique) reference to sex education in the final policy document is in the line, ""The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme need to be extended to all schools as early as possible.""

&gt; * Interestingly, the HRD ministry website, in its description of the Adolescence Education Programme, reads, ""Imparting authentic knowledge to learners about Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health (ARSH) concerns..."" is among the objectives of the National Popular Education Programme (NPEP).

Triple Talaq debate should be between muslims who want reforms and those who don't: PM Modi

Modi said, ""It is the responsibility of the government and the people of the country to give justice to Muslim women under the Constitution.""





Modi said, ""It is the responsibility of the government and the people of the country to give justice to under the Constitution.""

Amid a legal battle between a section of and All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on triple talaq, Prime Minister on Monday urged the political parties not to politicise the issue and said that all have equal rights . He also termed as an unfair practice.

“Is it fair for a man to say ‘talaaq’ thrice over the phone and a Muslim woman’s life to be ruined? This issue shouldn’t be politicised,” said PM Modi at a rally in Mahoba (Uttar Pradesh).





PM Modi's comments come a day after AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi had accused him of ""converting the issue into a political tool"" ahead of assembly elections in some states.

""Around 7.36 crore are married in the country and they have not divorced. Hardly one per cent of have gone for 'talaq'. But, (Narendra) Modi is making this a tool in his 'Mann ki Baat' for political gains in view of the forthcoming elections,"" Owaisi said at a public meeting at Kausa in Mumbra.



“I request people who participate in TV debates to not make women rights a Muslim-Hindu issue. Women’s right is a development issue. The debate should be between who want reforms and those who do not want reforms,” he added.

The F-16IN and Gripen-E certainly fit that category. The Rafale would really be high-end, it can carry a greater payload than the ""heavy"" Su-30MKI and is more capable. That's why it turned out to be so expensive. 

Personally, I would prefer the Super Hornet for the role. It's a high-end medium, sure, but it is a proven design and is known to be reliable and affordable to operate. It is in service with its primary customer (the US Navy) in large numbers and that customer is committed to a series of planned upgrade programmes that can feed the IAF fleet as well.

But I'm daydreaming. Shukla has already said that the Super Hornet is not on the table. In that case, I feel Modi should make an executive decision and simply take the F-16IN offer. The Viper might not be as good a fighter as the Gripen, but it ticks the right boxes when it comes to building a strategic partnership, Make-in-India, reliability, affordability, etc. If it goes through, expect increased co-operation in carrier design, nuclear energy, containing Chinese ambitions, and so on as well.

Former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) and leader of the All India Students Federation Kanhaiya Kumar said he does not hesitate to call himself a member of the “anti-Modi camp”.

Kanhaiya, who shot to limelight after he allegedly raised ‘anti-India’ slogans at the JNU campus on February 9 this year, was invited to Ludhiana on Sunday by Punjabi Sahit Academy and Social Thinkers Forum for a seminar on “Challenges of Education: Increasing cost—Reducing Jobs” at Punjabi Bhawan.

On the issue of being called “anti-India” by some political leaders, Kanhaiya said: “Some people call me anti-India. Modi is not India but for some he is. For me India is 1.25 crore people of the country but yes but I am a member of anti-Modi camp and I say this without any hesitation,” said Kanhaiya.

The student leader also attacked the RSS and the BJP saying that both of them were trying to “communalise” the secular environment of the country.

“It is the state policy of the BJP and the RSS that they would not allow harmony between Hindus and Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims. It is their mindset that secular people have to defeat,” he said. The youth leader also criticised the price rise of essential commodities and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was helping the trading community so that they could earn profit by charging more on these commodities. “Private businessmen buy pulses from farmers at a low price and sell it to the government on triple rate,” he claimed.

Keeping alive the ‘surgical strikes’ issue ahead of state polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said people celebrated ‘choti Diwali’ when the Army destroyed terrorist launch pads across LoC, and asked them not to forget valour of security forces. Addressing a public rally after launching slew of projects in his Lok Sabha constituency, Modi asked citizens to also remember soldiers even when there are no sounds of firing of bullets and shelling on borders.

“When I saw on TV, read in newspapers and some locals informed me that residents of Kashi have celebrated choti Diwali. When the army displayed its valour on September 29, the entire Kashi witnessed celebrations.

“As your MP, I feel proud of the manner in which you paid tributes to valour of armed forces and expressed your support to them,” he said.

The Prime Minister said that the nation has been able to convey to the armed forces that the entire country of 125 crore people is behind them. He asked countrymen to send Diwali greetings to security forces. The greetings can be sent to security forces through an App which can be downloaded by giving a missed call on 1922.

“Security forces should always feel how proud we are about them,” Modi said, adding that the nation should hail their valour and courage all time.

Referring to the initiatives of his government, Modi said “we are not a government whose work stops at laying foundation stones. It is ensured that the projects are also completed”.

Schemes are not about publishing advertisements in newspapers, the real aim of initiatives is proper execution and touching people’s lives, he added. Modi launched seven projects, including a gas pipeline and power projects, involving an expenditure of Rs 5,000 crore.

Some more thoughts:

Possibly Mistry was trying to take control of Tata Trusts which have 65% share in Tata Sons. If he would have managed to do that it would have practically become a Shapoorji Pallonji group. Whoever appoints the trustees controls those trusts and thereby tata group. Maybe that's the game he was playing. The game also needed some government help so maybe he reached out to someone in BJP. 

Tata trusts are charitable trusts and used to come under the control of charity commiosner. Ratan  tata managed to get a waiver in 2005. So I think the government can influence the outcome here. 

Ratan tata got the whiff and screwed both mistry and bjp.

NEW DELHI: Theacrimony in the SP first family+delivered an unexpected spin-off for BJP, withSP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav+citingNarendra Modias the role model of an obedient son who respects mother and visits her even after becoming PM. Mulayam held up Modi's example while addressing party workers at a tumultuous meeting in Lucknow in what seemed an oblique hint to sonAkhilesh Yadav+of what was expected from a respectful offspring.



WhileMulayam's comments+seemed to reflect his disappointment with Akhilesh, BJP leaders were happy to read them as an endorsement of Modi's family values.""Look at Modi, he has become PM with sheer hard work. He comes from a poor family and keeps claiming that he can't live without his mother. He hasn't left his mother even today,"" Mulayam said.



The reference boosts BJP's claims that it is the only outfit not affected by a dynastic or single-leader syndrome and can deliver unbiased governance in UP .



""Mulayam shared his own example about the ideological fights they had but they never crossed the Lakshman rekha, unlike the leaders of his party,"" BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told TOI. He said the SP chief 's example of the PM was testimony that Akhilesh has not only disappointed the state but his father too. Although Sharma welcomed Mulayam citing BJP leaders as individuals worth emulating, he said parties treated as family fiefs end up in a quagmire like the one SP finds itself in. ""You reap what you sow,"" Sharma said, accusing Mulayam of harbouring dynastic politics that led to the current mess.

___

We define non-vegetarians as those consuming either eggs or fish or meat or any combination of these. (Source: File) We define non-vegetarians as those consuming either eggs or fish or meat or any combination of these. (Source: File)

In the eyes of the world, India is seen as a vegetarian country. Presumably, this impression has been created by our best brand ambassadors from political, spiritual and yoga circles. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a strict vegetarian. The popular yoga guru, Baba Ramdev, and many other Hindu religious leaders too, are vegetarians and preach vegetarianism.

But what is the reality? To know this, we dig into India’s largest household consumption surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). They were conducted in 1993-94, 2004-05 and 2011-12, each time with a sample size of over one lakh households, with a one-month recall period. We define non-vegetarians as those consuming either eggs or fish or meat or any combination of these. By this definition, 62.3 per cent of Indian households consumed non-vegetarian food in 2011-12, up from 56.7 per cent in 1993-94, and 58.2 per cent in 2004-05. So the trend is quite clear — non-vegetarianism is on the rise. The Sample Registration System Baseline Survey 2014, however, states that 71 per cent of Indians were non-vegetarians as on January 1, 2014. But this study covers only that segment of the population which is above 15 years of age; the NSSO survey includes individuals of all age groups. Hence the two are not comparable.

Which state has the most vegetarians? If you are thinking of Gujarat, the home of Gandhi and Narendra Modi, think again. While 28 per cent of Gujarat’s population eats non-vegetarian food, Punjab has an even lower percentage (23 per cent) of non-vegetarians. Haryana, however, has the lowest non-vegetarian population in the country with just 19 per cent non-vegetarian households, and has remained so since 1993-94 (see map).

A state-wide analysis shows that seven states in the Northeast had the highest proportion (97 per cent) of non-vegetarians in 2011-12, followed by West Bengal (95 per cent) and Kerala (92 per cent). At the other end, Haryana is followed by Rajasthan (20 per cent), Punjab (23 per cent) and Gujarat (28 per cent). There has been a sharp increase in the proportion of non-vegetarians in Jammu and Kashmir — from 35 per cent in 1993-94 to 71 per cent in 2004-05.

The percentage of non-vegetarians in the state increased to 74 per cent in 2011-12. The sharp increase is, presumably, due to the exodus of Hindus from the state during this period.

While the trend toward non-vegetarianism is clear, what is interesting to note is that it has been marked by a “chicken revolution”. The proportion of households consuming chicken shot up from eight per cent in 1993-94 to 38 per cent in 2011-12, while that of the fish-eating households increased marginally from 30 per cent to 32 per cent over the same period. The proportion of goat-meat/mutton-eaters has fallen significantly — from 30 per cent in 1993-94 to 15 per cent in 2011-12. The population of beef and buffalo meat-eaters has remained more or less constant at about six per cent over this period. Interestingly, the proportion of so-called “eggetarians” (those consuming only eggs) has fallen drastically from about 24 per cent in 1993-94 to merely 3.5 per cent in 2011-12.

A structural change in the poultry industry by organised large hatcheries like Venkateshwara and Suguna — who have mainstreamed small holders — seems to have ushered in the “chicken revolution”. As a result, broiler meat production rose from less than 0.2 million metric tonnes (mmt) in 1991 to about 2.47 mmt in 2011-12, and egg production from about 24 billion to 66 billion by 2011-12.

Normally, rising non-vegetarianism is attributed to increasing incomes and resulting diversification of diets for better and higher protein intake. However, the Indian story may not be that simple. Religious beliefs have played an important role in keeping meat consumption low in some states. For example, Kerala and Punjab are both prosperous states with comparable per capita incomes, but Kerala has 92 per cent non-vegetarians and Punjab only 23 per cent. Across states, correlation between per-capita incomes and non-vegetarianism does not

yield positive results.

Also from the Op-ed section: Badri Raina writes – Who owns the nation?

Religious movements in Punjab — Arya Samaj, Radhasoami and Namdharis — seem to have played an influential role in restricting meat consumption in the state. It is likely that vegetarians consume more milk to meet their protein requirements. The proportion of milk-consuming households increased from 70 per cent in 1993-94 to 81 per cent in 2011-12. India is the largest producer of milk (146 mmt in 2014-15), although per capita availability (322 g/day) still remains low. Internationally too, among countries with comparable or even lower per capita incomes, India has the lowest level of per capita meat consumption — 2.9 kg in 2015, of which 1.7kg/ capita is poultry meat (see graph: Total annual per capita meat consumption). Pakistan’s annual per capita meat consumption is about four times that of India; the country has a lower per capita income than India.

What do these numbers indicate for food and nutritional security? Indians draw only about one per cent calorie-intake and three per cent protein-intake from eggs, fish and meat. Given the high incidence of malnutrition in India, especially among children, this is somewhat worrisome for nutritionists. Will government policy promote egg or meat consumption for better nutrition? The chances are dim. But the government can give a fillip to poultry consumption by reducing import duty on chicken legs from 100 per cent to say 20 per cent. Meat consumption will increase primarily through private sector initiatives such as of KFC and McDonald’s, which can ensure food safety requirements are met. Modernised, well-equipped abattoirs will also help as they have in making India one of the largest exporters of buffalo meat. Milk and milk-products can be promoted by cooperatives with support from the government.

Further, since chicken rules the roost, not pork or beef, the feed pressure will be much less in India, as chicken is a comparatively more efficient convertor of energy with feed-to-meat ratio of 1.6:1 compared to 5:1 for pork and 7:1 for beef. This, coupled with low levels of meat consumption, will keep demand for feed food subdued. While the trend towards non-vegetarianism is increasing, vegetarians are certainly more benign to the planet’s environmental health.

421,"Unlike bhakts, everyone else knows UCC was bought in by Modi and BJP just before elections to communally polarize elections. Triple talaq was a separate debate which was going on and muslim women's groups like Bharatiya muslim mahalon andolan were fighting for the past 10 years. Zakia soman etc became activists after 2002 riots to help victims get justice. Modi and BJP who presided over the 2002 riots suddenly become concerned about Muslims women's rights. Everyone can see through their hypocrisy. And that's why you see the opposition today which is happening because Modi and BJP appropriated their 10 year fight to fulfill their communal agenda.

Q About India s relations with Russia and Iran.


A  India buys cheap sour crude as Diesel consumptions is more locally. 
India does not buy best grades but more of worst grade cheap crude. No single source can provide all unhindered as oil supplier s have many internal conflicts. You never know which supply may stop.
Indian crude oil purchase is called a basket.

 India does not play one country against another, period.
nether is it involved in any single conflict in Arab world or rest of the world except if it is via UN like peacekeeping mission.

Standing up against China and Pak is a first and possible coz of  Modi support.


Iran had best of relationship with USA and now it is a past story.

There are multiple factor s at play for any long term oil/gas deal to be successful, like distance of transportation, or conflict proneness of area etc, it is not simply playing one country against another.

 If India gets gas at cheapest price from Iran then the investment in port and road to AF can translate direct benefits to India faster.
India is simply hedging it's future $ urea spend in that Port.


Gas prices are at bottom so urea plant in India or Iran maybe a thought.
Pipeline from Russia &amp; instability of areas it will pass is also thought.

The port is in a Greenfield stage, while US + NATO force in Afghanistan have an probable exit date chalked out.

Yes Afghanistan is resource rich but reality is Government is a shadow government and warlords rule.

Summary : 

1)India does not play one country against another.

2)India is simply hedging it's future $ urea spend in that Port.

3)Afghanistan is resource rich but reality is Government is a shadow government

As Narendra Modi lays the foundation for the east India gas pipeline, this is perhaps the most ambitious step that any government has taken in moving towards replacing the liquid fuel as the preferred choice for transportation and in the kitchen.

With an investment of ₹12500 crore, this 2500 km gas pipeline that was announced on Monday will connect West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and UP to the national grid. The project will be undertaken by GAIL, where the centre will fund 40% of the cost of the project. The project is envisaged to be operational in the next two years. Once completed this pipeline will carry clean fuel from the Dhamra port in Odisha to 40 districts and over 2000 villages. But the question remains: where is the gas?

Top sources in the government say that while domestic production of gas is dwindling, but a sharp increase in global production of gas and its subdued price has ensured that it has helped India’s imports. Global production of LNG (liquefied natural gas) is set to rise from 250 million tonne to 400 million tonne in the next five years. “Energy is a critical input for development. Even if we are not self-sufficient in gas production, for the first time a step is being taken towards creating infrastructure for storage and distribution of gas,” says a top source in the government, who did not wish to be named.

Keeping cooling global price of LNG (liquefied natural gas) in mind, India has already renegotiated its long-term gas purchase deal with Qatar. 45% of India’s gas requirement is imported and any sharp spike in the prices will cost the country precious foreign exchange.

But analysts disagree. “The mood of the market does not show any sign of a sharp increase in prices in the next five to six years,” said Anish De, partner and head of oil and gas in KPMG.

The tilt towards a gas-economy is necessary when India is committed towards reducing its dependence on coal and oil as part of the climate change programme. Gas is accepted as a cleaner fuel and it is cheaper.

Buoyed by RIL’s discovery in the Krishna-Goadavari (K-G Basin) basin, a step towards this was taken during the turn of the 21st century. But a decade later, litigation, arbitration and policy paralysis has taken the steam out of the gas sector. “In the last two years the government has done a credible job as far as making the right policy moves are concerned, this will bring back investment into the sector. You cannot undo what past governments have done,” said Anish De.

“The big difference this time is that the government is looking at identifying new customers for gas. From power and fertilizer plants we are no targeting customers in cities for use as CNG in cars and as a fuel for cooking,” said a top source in the government, who did not wish to be named.

But critics will always be there: “India pays about $6.5/mmBtu for importing LNG but pays around $2.5/mmBtu to domestic producers. Increase in the domestic pricing will give a huge fillip to private investment in the gas sector,” said RS Sharma, former CMD of ONGC.

Oil minister, Dharmendra Pradhan in an earlier interview with HT had countered this point and said, “Our motto is minimum government, maximum governance. Any natural resource policy should have only one intent: focus on the 1.2 billion Indians.”

432,"#This Is Not A Court Hearing, Cyrus Mistry Was Told When He Objected – NDTV Profit

But not the meeting on Monday which led to the shock exit of the company's chairman, Cyrus Mistry.

The company removed Mr Mistry, almost four years after he became its first chief from outside the Tata family, and brought back Ratan Tata, 78, who has taken interim charge until a successor is appointed.

Board meetings of Tata Sons are normally staid, predictable affairs.

""The board in collective wisdom and on recommendations of principle shareholders took a decision to change for long-term of interests of Tata Sons and Tata Group,"" a Tata Sons spokesperson said.

Exclusive details provided to NDTV by at least two insiders privy to the events (one of them was present at the meeting) suggest that the countdown to Mr Mistry's removal led to acrimonious, unprecedented scenes inside the boardroom.

Mr Mistry's exit was not - perhaps deliberately - listed on the board agenda. An insider told NDTV that it was brought up as a 'residuary' item, under the 'any other items' category, listed at the end of every board agenda.

When it came up, Mr Mistry is said to have protested, calling it an illegal move.

He is said to have pointed out that according to the Tata rule book, a 15-day notice has to be given before bringing such an item before the Board, a timeframe, he said, in which he could have made a case for himself.

But the Board is said to have told him ""we have legal opinion"" in support of the decision. Mr Mistry asked to see the opinion; the board reportedly told him ""this was not a court hearing"".

At this point, Mr Mistry said he would challenge the decision. Reports suggest he may move the Bombay High Court as early as Tuesday.

Of the nine-member board, six voted in favour of his removal, two abstained. Mr Mistry, as the ninth member, refused to be part of the process.

He however remains a member of the Tata board, as well as a Director of the company.

Another board insider told NDTV that the decision to remove Mr Mistry has been weeks, perhaps months, in the making. The decision, he said, ""was not based on pique"", but entirely on Mr Mistry's dismal performance as CEO.

Only two of Tata's multiple companies are profitable, he said, almost all the others are struggling.

Asked why Mr Mistry's ouster lacked the traditional courtesies favoured by the Tata group, the insider said they were simply following global precedent, where a ""guillotine"" approach is favoured when removing high executives.

In a letter to employees on Monday, Ratan Tata wrote that ""in the interest of the stability of and reassurance to the Tata Group,"" he is returning as Chairman.

Mr Tata also wrote to PM Modi informing him of the change.

NEW DELHI:Cyrus Mistryhas decided to moveBombay High CourtagainstTata Sons' decision toremove him from Chairman's post+.



In a surprise development on Monday evening,Cyrus Mistry+was sacked as chairman of Tata Sons. He was replaced byRatan Tata.



The decision was taken at the board meeting of Tata Sons.



The board named a five-member search committee, which includes Tata, to choose a successor to Mistry within four months.



Mistry's family firm Shapoorji Pallonji Group has 18.4 per cent in Tata Sons — the holding company of $100-billion salt-to-software conglomerate.



Mistry, 48, who replaced Ratan Tata, 78, as chairman in December 2012, was only the sixth group Chairman in nearly 15 decades and the first from outside the Tata family. He will remain a director of the individual companies, though his tenure as Chairman is the shortest so far at the group.

MUMBAI: On a day CyrusMistrywas ousted as the chairman ofTata Sons, the Group Executive Council (GEC) set up by him has been disbanded.



The GEC, headed by Mistry, was set up in April 2013 with the objective providing strategic and operational support to him. It included NS Rajan from Ernst &amp; Young, Tata brand custodian Mukund Rajan, ex-BSE chief Madhu Kannan, strategist Nirmalya Kumar and Tata veteran Harish Bhat.



Mukund Rajan and Harish Bhat will be offered new roles within the group, sources in the know of the development said.



However, it is unclear what fate awaits for the rest of the members in the group.



Soon after making public the departure of Mistry,Tata Group's website removed all the details related to the GEC, including profile of the members.



""The page you are looking for has been moved or removed,"" said a message on the web page of GEC on Tata group's official website.

Incidentally in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal is always seen fighting and blaming PM Narendra Modi for all that are wrong in the national capital.(PTI)

Arvind Kejriwal, chief of Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister, today said he would fall on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s feet for the rights of people in Punjab. Jagran.com reported Kejriwal as saying this while talking to AAP workers at Batala, Gurdaspur in Punjab.

Kejriwal further said that if PM Modi refuses to give Punjabis their rights, then he would force the PM to give them.

Incidentally in Delhi, Kejriwal is always seen fighting and blaming PM Modi for all that are wrong in the national capital.

Before Kejriwal reached the venue of the programme, where he addressed AAP workers, members of the Congress took to the roads, raising the slogan of “Kejriwal Go Back”. Some Congress members were seen holding placards that called AAP as “Aam Ashiq Party” and “Anti-Aurat Party”.

Jargran.com reported Kejriwal as saying that the Congress and SAD-BJP were united to ensure that Punjab doesn’t develop. Kejriwal appealed to AAP workers to continue their unity and work hard for the upcoming elections.

Kejriwal promised, if elected, AAP government would open free clinics in every district and not increase any tax for five years.

Releasing AAP’s election manifesto yesterday, Kejriwal had said his party will remove “Inspector Raj” and the people will no

longer have to tolerate “Gunda Tax” if AAP comes to power. He said a new business hub will also be constructed in Ropad. “To make Taxation transparent and easy, all the taxes, including the Value Added Tax (VAT) will be reduced just like we did in Delhi. In the next five years, the tax paid here will be the lowest in the country,” he said. “Our party is dedicated to erase corruption and to make it possible, we will start single-window system in the state,” he added.

New Delhi:  Realising that a cabinet secretary now gets paid more than the President of India, the Central government has decided to give the President, Vice President and Governors a raise.



The scale is whopping - more than 200%, which will lift the President's salary from the current Rs 1.5 lakh a month to Rs 5 lakh. The Vice-President's salary will increase to Rs 3.5 lakh a month from the existing Rs 1.10 lakh a month.



Once a President retires, he will get a pension of Rs 1.5 lakh. The spouses of Presidents will get a secretarial assistance of Rs 30,000 per month.



The government's decision comes after it faced an uncomfortable situation following the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission. Currently the cabinet secretary is drawing a higher salary than the President.



The matter needs Parliament's approval - which is expected in the coming winter session. Once cleared, the salary will be made applicable from January 2016.



The President's salary was raised last in 2008 from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh



But with the current raise, pressure is expected to mount on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give the go ahead for the increase in the salaries of lawmakers, which has been pending approval.



In August, around 250 lawmakers signed a petition asking for a raise, but the government is weighing its options. Sources said PM Modi was not too keen to approve in view of the government's austerity measures.



If the pay hike is approved, the monthly basic salary of a lawmaker will double to a lakh. Besides, 100% raise will be granted as constituency allowance and salaries of their office staff. The annual furniture allowance will double to 1,50,000 and monthly pensions for former lawmakers will rise from Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000.

448,"#India is moving towards a flawed GST

___

[IMAGE](http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2016/10/24/Photos/Opinion/ss-kF6G--621x414@LiveMint.jpg)

There are several reasons why this newspaper has been an enthusiastic supporter of the goods and services tax (GST). It will integrate the Indian market, promote economic efficiency by taxing final consumption rather than intermediate goods, encourage voluntary compliance and create a new architecture for cooperative federalism.

There were two underlying assumptions for a truly successful GST. The new indirect tax would be levied at a single rate (with a few exceptions) so as to reduce distortions based on rent-seeking behaviour. And the tax rate would be low so as to minimize the regressive character of such indirect taxes, including the ones that GST is replacing. India seems to be drifting away from the goal of a single, moderate GST rate.

The news coming from the meeting of the GST council last week is thus far from encouraging. It seems that India is moving to a multiplicity of rates, with a cess thrown in for good measure. And it is likely that India is going to end up with a relatively high GST rate. This is in stark contrast to the idea of a flawless GST that was proposed in the December 2009 report of a task force headed by Arbind Modi, who was then in the finance ministry, and the 12% rate recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission.

The stalemate in the GST council was expected. It was always unlikely that the complex federal bargaining would be over in three days. There are many months of negotiations ahead. What is worrying is the direction these negotiations are taking, rather than the time needed to strike a deal. The political class is quite naturally worried that a low GST rate will hurt budgetary revenue. Further, an increase in the prices of items of mass consumption could lead to a political backlash, hence the multiple slabs rather than a single rate.

The states would do well to consider two factors in their calculations. First, they can take the risk of beginning with a low GST rate since any potential revenue losses are to be compensated by New Delhi for five years, so there is insurance against the downside. Second, they have agreed to shift to GST based on the assumption that the new tax will both increase the existing tax base as well as give the economy extra momentum, which will make a lower tax rate possible. The state finance ministers are currently taking a static rather than a dynamic view of indirect tax collections under GST.

The issue of the GST rate actually needs to be seen in tandem with the broader issue of tax reform. What is happening now is the overhaul of the indirect tax system. The direct tax system has not been touched as yet. A lot of preparatory work had already been done by the finance ministry under P. Chidambaram on a new direct tax code, which was then inexplicably shelved. Its promise was similar to that of GST—low rates, minimal exemptions and a wider tax base. Higher direct tax collections will create fiscal space for India to experiment with a lower GST rate.

India began to reform its tax system in 1991 when almost nine out of every 10 rupees flowing into the national treasury came from indirect taxes rather than direct taxes. One of the explicit goals of economic reforms was to raise the contribution of direct taxes in the total kitty. There was good reason to do so. Most large economies depend more on direct taxes because they are progressive while indirect taxes are regressive. One of the many hypocrisies of Indian socialism was that it was built on one of the most regressive tax systems in the world.

The 1991 tax reforms did succeed. The year 2009 was an important milestone, when direct taxes overtook indirect taxes in the central kitty. The balance has since been reversed, partly because of the drop in corporate tax collections in the subsequent industrial slowdown as well as the increase in fuel taxes over the past two years. The tax system has become more regressive, as we had pointed out in these columns a year ago.

Lower direct tax collections mean there is pressure to collect more indirect taxes. The problem of a high GST rate can be traced to this underlying problem with the direct tax system. A more dynamic view is needed. The growth dividend from GST will ensure that total tax collections are not harmed despite a lower tax rate. And a renewed push for direct tax reforms should ideally create fiscal space for a lower GST rate.

The upshot: The debate on the GST rate needs to be framed against the larger issue of tax reforms if India is to avoid a messy transition to the new tax.

Will direct tax reforms create the fiscal space for a lower GST rate? Tell us at views@livemint.com

An influential educational lobby group wants English out of educational institutions. Total fidelity to Indian languages is capable of reshaping frameworks of thought and transforming India. All patriots must support the project. Here’s how it should be done.

The RSS-affiliated Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas (SSUN) has told the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) that the English language should gradually be removed as a medium of instruction at all levels of education in India, both in public and private institutions. According to the Indian Express , the SSUN wants the new education policy to prioritise Indian languages and urges that IITs and IIMs must immediately introduce education in the vernaculars.

The organisation also says that foreign languages should not be offered as an alternative to any Indian language and that the University Grants Commission must only sponsor research work that fulfils “national requirements”. Any references that insult Indian culture, tradition, sects, thoughts and eminent personalities must forthwith be expunged from all textbooks.

This is a grand intellectual enterprise designed to close India off from foreign influences. The idea behind removing all references that insult our culture is that students can from now on, without being challenged, be told that plastic surgery and genetic science both existed in ancient India. We can accept as truth the view that our venerable scientists discovered the Pythagoras theorem but that “we very gracefully allowed the Greeks to take the credit”, as minister for science and technology Harsh Vardhan once told us . India also knew “beej ganit” long before the Arabs but we “very selflessly allowed it to be called algebra”. Similarly, students can be told to read ancient Sanskrit texts to build indigenous aircraft as Captain Anand Bodas, a retired principal of a pilot training centre, told the Indian Science Congress in 2015.

The idea to get rid of English is particularly revolutionary, since it stems from the right assumption that blocking foreign languages is to deny or curtail access to other knowledge systems, their distinctive possibilities of meaning and their technical repertoire. Culture minister Mahesh Sharma has already promised to purge India of western influences and once foreign languages are blocked, total fidelity to Indian languages (and content) can potentially reshape our frameworks of thought. If this is the audacious plan then there really is no moment to lose.

But the RSS-affiliate’s ambition in this regard is, unfortunately, limited and disappointing. When the idea is to totally takeover the Indian mind, why start only with schools? Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure as Prime Minister was, mind you, a wasted opportunity for the RSS’ cultural agenda. If we focus mainly on schools now it could be 15-20 years before we see a true vernacular restoration in the country. Why not adopt a more radical approach with an India-wide intervention across sectors, where all patriotic Indians can contribute to the cause of the disappearance of the English language?

The RSS must, to that end, press the Narendra Modi government to try these five ideas:

First, the revolution must begin at home, by example. The RSS should ensure that all BJP politicians, from the village level to the Union Cabinet, sign a pledge that they will enrol their four-year old children and grandchildren in only Hindi-medium or regional language institutions. It is not fair to ask the others without first having a go yourself, innit? Children of BJP leaders who are already enrolled in English-medium institutions must come up to speed with Hindi in a couple of years and switch schools or and those keen on the sciences should try and enrol in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi Vishwavidyalaya in Bhopal which offers engineering courses exclusively in Hindi but currently has all or almost all seats vacant, as there are few takers for the degree .

Two, the real trick is to quickly end the Indians’ fascination with English – a surgical strike on the language so to speak since that’s the new language for everything from Pakistan to black money. Since we are very good at banning films, books and plays we don’t like, why not ban students from taking the TOEFL, SAT, GRE, GMAT and IELTS as these tests are mainly about getting Indians to leave the country and study more English in foreign universities. Imagine the gall of Western civilisation to make us learn their English language and then test our proficiency in it. Can there be a greater illustration of our (daily) cultural subjugation and humiliation? How dare we allow the imagination of our youth to be entirely dominated by this language in the process of training for it? All revolutions begin with the ruthless excision of elites. Stop those trying to escape the country; the rest will follow.

This is a particularly auspicious moment to try this move. Since we are now habitually testing the patriotism of fellow Indians, it is now time to call all non-resident Indians home and convince them that making a living through the use of English in the English-speaking world is total haram. The ones really needing shuddikaran are those who are yet to come back to India. The Prime Minister has already called on the diaspora to come back and avail of new opportunities in India, so this would be a good time to honour him.

And in the spirit of testing patriotism of others and figuring out how big the problem is, the government of India should do an extensive social audit and have a national register of all the politicians, industrialists, bureaucrats, and film stars etc who have their children studying abroad in foreign universities. And they must all be volunteered by their parents to atone for the error of their English-speaking vocations and return to the vernacularised treasure trove that is India. Not only that, all those with children studying abroad must be immediately disqualified from being given a Padma or any national award. Surely, having a child abroad studying in a Western university is the cultural equivalent of nurturing a sleeper cell that will eventually harm India.

Four, the role of the media in developing new discourses and initiating cultural change. All TV programming during the day should here on be in Hindi or in regional languages. English content will be provided 11pm onward alongside other adult material. Some nationalist English news anchors will unfortunately have to move to the 11pm slot or switch to Hindi but either way it will be worth the effort for transforming India.

So there you have it: If all school-going children of BJP leaders study exclusively in Hindi or regional languages, if middle-class children are prevented from taking entrances tests in English to go abroad, if there are sanctions for elites who send children to English-medium institutions here or in foreign countries and if vernacular programming dominates on TV, India’s language revolution could be just years away. This approach, based on paranoia about English, is a lot easier for governments rather than collaborating with (liberal) academics in cultural projects aimed at increasing the use of vernaculars.

One other matter remains. Societies usually frame laws and policies that favour the powerful at the expense of the marginalised. The prescriptions for the former usually differ from those for the latter. A politician like Mulayam Singh Yadav, for example, will recommend Hindi to his constituents but send his son Akhilesh to study environmental engineering in Australia. The situation can now fortunately be flipped. Once the Indian middle class and elites begin to embrace and discover the exclusive joys of Hindi and other vernaculars, marginalised groups like Dalits, Muslims, tribals and women should be encouraged to learn English and persist with that language so that they have zero professional prospects in the future. In other words, marginalised Indians should stick to English and live with the indignity of being influenced by the world, not just India.

So go for it then, MHRD. Ignore the Chinese who are educating millions in English to try and dominate the world. Save our souls from that very language instead.

With just two weeks to the US Presidential election, Donald Trump's new ad borrows Prime Minister Narendra Modi's winning catchphrase in the 2014 national election. ""Ab Ki Baar, Trump Sarkaar"" - the Republican nominee enunciates slowly midway in the ad, fade to the text: ""Great for America, Great for US-India relationship."" The ad has been made by the Republican Hindu coalition, which organised the meeting in New Jersey addressed by Mr Trump over a week ago.

Raipur:  Expressing confidence that by 2030 India would lead the world in ""almost every category"", US Ambassador to India Richard R Verma today said people are excited about the Indo-US partnership which is poised to strengthen further.



""I look out into the future in India...just take 2030.

""That's why people are so excited about India's rise and what's happening here. That's why I am excited about the partnership we have with you (India)...we can't agree on every issue, but we can get really a lot of important things done,"" he added.



Mr Verma termed the last two years as the best period in the relationship between the two countries. He said US President Barack Obama wants India to be a strong, prosperous and a successful global power.



""We changed, India has changed...We were on two separate tracks for many a decade. Those tracks are now coming together. If you ask (US) president about how he feels about India, he would say he wants India to be strong and prosperous,"" he said.



Speaking about various fronts on which both the countries have collaborated and succeeded, he stressed that the two countries broke records in several categories last year.



""We had the highest two-way trade between the two countries ever of $110 billion. US was the largest export market for India.

Her reaction came in the backdrop of World Bank’s fresh data released today about doing business in various countries across the globe. In the latest ‘Doing Business’ report,(PTI)

Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman expressed her disappointment over India’s low rank in World Bank doing business index and its failure to achieve the set deadline. In her reaction on Twitter she wrote, ” Disappointed at our rank this year. Many of our reformatory steps were after WB deadline. Hopefully, with other steps, will help next year.”

Her reaction came in the backdrop of World Bank’s fresh data released today about doing business in various countries across the globe. In the latest ‘Doing Business’ report,

India’s place remained unchanged from last year’s original ranking of 130 among the 190 economies that were assessed on various parameters.

Disappointed at our rank this year. Many of our reformatory steps were after WB deadline. Hopefully, with other steps, will help next yr. http://t.co/uE8kG3JYW0 — Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) October 25, 2016

However, last year’s ranking has now been revised to 131 from which the country has improved its place by one spot. The World Bank’s report came at a time when Narendra Modi-led government is patting its back over the different initiatives it has taken over the last 2 years that is expected to bring unprecedented economic growth in the near future.

In the same vein, the government has been making efforts to improve the ease of doing business and its stated claim is to bring the country up into the top 50.

In his reaction, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said, ” Many more measures in the pipeline to improve ease of doing business; hope we will get a better rank next year.”

In the email, Sack said that Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace’s International Executive Director from November 2009 until December 2015, was planning to get in touch with him on this issue. In the email, Sack said that Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace’s International Executive Director from November 2009 until December 2015, was planning to get in touch with him on this issue.

Environmental groups like Greenpeace and other international NGOs working in India had sought US government intervention after their funding came under increased scrutiny of the Modi government, according to emails released by the Wikileaks.

The emails – hacked from the email account of John Podesta, who is the chairman of the Clinton Campaign – also indicates the global funding links of these NGOs, including those environmental groups opposing a massive mining project in Australia being undertaken by the Adani Group.

“Adani is very close to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi –so this will be a delicate diplomatic challenge,” Sergio Knaebel, grant director of the Sandler Foundation, wrote in an email to Podesta on May 27, 2015, months after he left the White House to be the Chairman of the Clinton Foundation.

Based out of San Francisco, the Sandler Foundation till 2015 had charitable grants of more than USD 750 million to various NGOs globally working in areas like environmental protection, labour, education, and human rights.

The Sandler Foundation among other things have funded the Sunrise Project, which is opposing Adani’s USD 21.7 billion mine project in Australia.

“The situation for NGOs in Australia is also getting pretty serious. The Abbot government has set its sights on organisations fighting the expansion of coal and for protecting the reef — and is looking to withdraw charitable status and out foreign donours in an effort to cast the NGO’s work as foreign intervention.

“Same playbook as India (and Canada),” Knaebel wrote in an email to Podesta.

Podesta did not make any commitment, but forwarded to Knaebel a series of email exchanges he had with Karen Sack from Ocean Unite, another environmental group.

Sack is currently the managing director of Washington-based Ocean Unite.

Before joining Ocean Unite, she was senior director for International Oceans at The Pew Charitable Trusts where she helped initiate the Global Ocean Commission.

Before that, she was the Head of Greenpeace International’s Political and Business Unit and the Head of their international oceans campaign.

“What’s going on in India is concerning. There are some interesting linkages between the coal industry there and in Australia,” Sack wrote on May 27, 2015.

“Adani — the coal billionaire from India is the person who plans to invest in building a coal port just near the Great Barrier Reef – which has people up in arms down under.

“The fascinating thing is that some of the big banks are refusing to invest in the port development project because of the potential risks to investors from the uncertainty,” she told Podesta in the email.

A day earlier, she sought the help of Podesta on the issue of Greenpeace asserting that because of the Indian government action it is on the verge of being closed.

“I have had a request from some colleagues at Greenpeace as they are facing a very serious situation in India,” Sack wrote.

“In a nutshell: an Indian Intelligence Bureau report was ‘leaked’ alleging Greenpeace India was responsible for a loss of 2-3 per cent of the country’s GDP.

“Since then the Ministry of Home Affairs has kept up a relentless attack of allegations of irregularities in their registration and has now frozen all their bank accounts, both foreign and domestic, despite a Delhi High Court ruling there was no basis for doing so,” she said.

“The bottom line is that without some kind of intervention, they will have to close down by the end of June. This has never happened to a Greenpeace office in the entire history of the organisation,” Sack wrote.

In the email, Sack said that Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace’s International Executive Director from November 2009 until December 2015, was planning to get in touch with him on this issue.

“Kumi Naidoo was hoping to speak with you or to get advice on who might be able to help behind the scenes explaining to people close to the Prime Minister that their campaigns are about the issues of clean air and clean water and not personal and their office should not be forced to close because they have a different vision of India’s future,” Sack said.

“Apparently, The Podesta Group has the contract for the Republic of India in the US, but Kumi has no way to reach Tony or another principal,” Sack said.

Podesta did not make any commitment but did say he would be happy to connect the two.

“Happy to put Kumi in touch with Tony, but the list of people similarly situated seems to be growing,” Podesta wrote in his email indicating that GreenPeace is not the only NGO facing the problem in India.

Tony Podesta is the brother of John Podesta.

Podesta Group is one of the two lobbying firms for the Indian government since 2010.

It received $700,000 per annum for its lobbying activists on behalf of the Indian government.

Yesterday, Ratan Tata, interim chairman of Tata Group, had written to PM Modi, informing him about the decision of the Tata Sons Board to replace chairman Cyrus P Mistry.

Cyrus Mistry’s removal from Tata Group’s Chairman post created a flutter in the corporate world on Monday. Speculations are now rife that he might meet PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi to argue his case against his dismissal. According to TOI, As chairman, Mistry was seen to be keen on building ties with the political establishment – perhaps in order to build his profile as successor to Ratan Tata, and maybe even secure his position within the group.

Yesterday, Ratan Tata, interim chairman of Tata Group, had written to PM Modi, informing him about the decision of the Tata Sons Board to replace chairman Cyrus P Mistry. “A new management structure is being put in place and a Selection Committee has been constituted to identify the next chairman of Tata Sons,” Ratan Tata informed PM Modi in the letter, adding, “The committee has been mandated to complete the process in four months,” he wrote. Earlier, Ratan Tata had written to employees of the company, telling them that he took up the role of interim chairman in the interest of stability and reassurance to the group. In a letter, Tata, 78, said the board of directors of Tata Sons in its meeting today replaced Cyrus P Mistry as Chairman, with immediate effect.

Tata on Tuesday also held a meeting at Bombay House with the Group CEOs and assured all group companies of a stable and steady environment and told them there is no cause of concern. He even said that the selection committee will keep in mind the long-term interests of all the group companies. He even requested all the companies to not get swayed by speculations. “Strategy will be to continue focussing on core strengths of the group and diversify them,” he added.

Meanwhile, Pepsico’s Indra Nooyi and Tata International MD Noel Tata have emerged as contenders for the post of Tata Group Chairman, reported CNBC-TV 18. Tata Sons has appointed a 5-member selection committee comprising Ratan N. Tata, Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya to decide on the new chairman of the Tata group.

Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for doing an “excellent job”, Hinduja brothers have said that PM Modi has new ideas and thoughts. “We feel proud abroad when we say that we are Indians and Mr Modi today can be accepted as the best Prime Minister for the world, and he is doing excellent work,” the Hinduja brothers told ET Now. “The only suggestion would be that his team would also move in the same pace and faster than what Mr Modi wants, because his vision is very good for the country,” they said. “He (PM Modi) has new ideas, he has new thoughts, he has gone internationally to all the countries, he has built up excellent relationships, so the rest is now for the private sector. We have to give some time to see how things will change,” they added.

Talking about the scenario of stressed assets, they said, “There have to be some guidelines that have to be given to the institutions, that they can take a hair cut, till the project is presented in a viable form. Any new investor who is coming, unless the project is viable, why will he put money? Once they do this, automatically the investments will start”.

“We need to apply the policies that have been formulated and uncertainties need to be removed. You are in a country, which is the best investment destination in the world at the moment. The situation in US economy is slow, stagnant, 1% GDP growth. If you go to UK, there are uncertainties over Brexit, EU is very bad. If we come further into Asia, you can see China, how their GDP growth is going down,” they said, expressing confidence in the Indian economy’s potential to attract investment.

Earlier this month, Prem Watsa the CEO and founder of Canada-based Fairfax Financial Holdings had been asll praises for PM Modi, even expressing hope that the latter is re-elected. “I have said this in our annual report and we are very bullish on India. This is because we consider Mr Modi to be the Lee Kuan Yew of India,” Watsa, who is often called the Warren Buffett of Canada, had said. “Mr Modi is a very hard working man. He has eliminated corruption at the top and I think he is going to do a wonderful wonderful job over the years. I am hoping he will be re-elected in a few years and re-elected again and India will be transformed during that time,” he had said.

The fact that international and Indian investors are expressing optimism about India and lauding the PM Modi’s efforts to push India as an investment destination will certainly be good news for the government and the economy as a whole.
