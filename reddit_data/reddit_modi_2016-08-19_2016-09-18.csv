&gt; * ... We in this region, some, look at terrorists as strategic tools.

&gt; * The Afghan envoy added, We hope that the call byAfghanistanandIndiafor peace will be listened to and that we dont see the use of terrorism as an instrument against other neighbours by any state or non-state actors.The ground realities are that terrorism is being supported, sanctuaries exist and they are used against other neighbours ... we hope countries in the region particularly,Afghanistan,IndiaandPakistancooperate genuinely and not talk that which is not matched by action.

&gt;* ""India's situation is getting worse at a much faster speed than China,"" Dan Greenbaum, president of Boston-based Health Effects Institute (HEI), told Reuters in Beijing.

&gt;* HEI and a group of Chinese and Indian universities recently said that over half of world's air pollution-related deaths were in China and India.

&gt;* India is also ramping up coal production as Prime Minister Narendra Modi races to meet election promises to provide electricity to a population of 1.3 billion.

&gt;* Research from HEI and Tsinghua University in Beijing released this week shows coal burning caused 366,000 premature deaths in China in 2013, out of a population of 1.35 billion.

&gt;* Chinese coal consumption more than tripled between 1990 and 2013, while air pollution deaths jumped 67 percent during the same period, the research showed.

18,"Anybody who thinks PM is doing this for domestic compulsions is being a fool, He is not trying to save his government, he has a majority govt. This is a decisive policy shift and a right one, this will put terrorist Pakistani state on backfoot. 

Balochistan is crucial for China because of its access to central asia and Gwadar port. Its time we put some more presssure, next thing to be done is open a International Baloch Human Rights Council in Delhi on the lines of Tibetian etc. and help them push their case in UN. Till now India is on defensive and its time we stop being that. 

Until now, India has never talked about Baluchistan whenever Indo-Pak issues were raised. Usually Pakistan brings up the topic of Kashmir, India goes defensive and the game goes on. India gets seen as a reluctant nation while Pakistan portrays itself as a nation open to talks and discussion. Unsuspecting foreign countries see Pakistan as the right party and push for a dialogue. In a bold move, India is signaling ways that could put not just Kashmir, but also Baluchistan in a possible future referendum.

Most Indians don’t think about Baluchistan - the sparsely populated largest province of Pakistan. When they think, most don’t want to raise any trouble there. I have written so many times as to why India should not interfere there. However, as Pakistan is mounting a new offensive on Kashmir, Indian public opinion is hardening. The belief is beginning to form that the way to solve Kashmir is not just through defense, but through straight offense and its winning applause even from the opposition party. 

In case of Kashmir, Pakistan has little to lose and hopes to gain a chunk of the valley, while India has something to lose. This gives Pakistan a really free hand in talking about the issue that India is so uncomfortable talking.

Now, India is openly talking about an issue that Pakistan is uncomfortable talking. Here India has nothing to lose, while Pakistan has a lot at stake. Especially with the Chinese developing a deep water port there, Baluchistan is more important than ever. If Pakistan loses Baluchistan, it loses most of its coastline.

It is likely based on the “Doval doctrine” of going on the offense. It worked great for the insurgents in the Northeast bringing down the violence of NSCN. While in the past, Nagaland has had hundreds of people dying from terrorism, this year that number is 5 - with no police/army casualty. 

In case of Kashmir, the offense cannot be merely at the terrorist groups, but its source itself, without going for a major war. If it is not mere talk and is a major policy shift (as i believe it is), then it is likely that India would openly arm Baluchistan rebels. Pakistan has already been split once [creating Bangladesh] and India’s threat is not empty. Given the mounting evidence that India has on Pakistan’s role in recent disturbance in Kashmir, it is probably prudent for India to get on the offensive to bring peace.

Until now it was the Indians who were offended by Pakistan’s statements and now Modi is putting the shoe on the other foot 

Shift in the global game:

1. Unlike Kashmir, Baluchistan is an important part of a geopolitical game. China wants to use it as its key entry point in the Indian Ocean &amp; in the Middle East. If Pakistan has the potential to lose the territory and put China’s project at risk, China could impress upon Pakistan to go for a settlement with India that reduces conflict in both Kashmir and Baluchistan.

2. Americans are also wary of China’s presence in the Indian ocean and might not mind Baluchis getting their freedom. US could potentially befriend the new nation to check Iran. Such an American game would put more pressure on Pakistan from Iran, China and others to reduce the flashpoint in Kashmir.

3. India’s stakes in losing a couple of districts in Kashmir [in a potential referendum, India could move for a district wise referendum to give voice to the minorities in the state] is far less than Pakistan losing its largest province and most of its coastline in Baluchistan. This might impact the Pakistan’s strategists when thinking of a move in Kashmir.

It is a brilliant move. Either India could make Pakistan agree that neither country would interfere in another’s affair or go for a process where both countries lose a piece of their territory - with Pakistan losing far more than India.",2016-08-19 15:13:23

New Delhi:  The BJP has faced more adversity in independent India than the Congress would have even during British Rule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today in comments that have drawn instant protest from the main opposition party.



Asserting that the BJP has made more sacrifices than any other political party, PM Modi, who laid the foundation for a new party office in Delhi, said, ""The BJP will be the only party which has faced hurdles all its life, with each effort scrutinised and judged negatively...The Congress, even during British Rule, didn't go through such adversity as we, our dedicated workers, have gone through in the last 50-60 years.""



The Congress has called it ""a grave insult to the freedom movement"" and has demanded PM Modi withdraw his comment and apologise.



""Modi ji has insulted India's freedom struggle and every person who was hanged, locked in jail and gave up everything for India. Modi ji has insulted Bharat Mata,"" said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, a short while after the Prime Minister made his speech at the BJP function attended by top party leaders like party chief Amit Shah, veteran leader LK Advani and senior ministers Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley among others.



PM Modi attacked the Trinamool Congress too when he said that the BJP found it difficult to hire an office in Kolkata during this year's assembly election in West Bengal as anybody willing to given them space would face trouble.

The BJP's new Delhi office is being built on a two-acre plot on a street named after Deen Dayal Upadhyay of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor. It is five km away from the present office on Ashoka Road.



It has to shift as the Supreme Court has ordered all political parties to vacate bungalows in what is called the Lutyen's Zone in the heart of the capital.



The BJP has ambitious real estate plans - 200 swank new party offices are coming up all over the country, all of them linked digitally. The Delhi office will be a multi-storeyed building with three blocks, plush interiors, Wi-Fi and video-conferencing facilities.



With much more space, former BJP presidents will get rooms. This means that party elders like LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, sidelined since the rise of the PM-Modi-Amit Shah team in the BJP, will have their own offices.

&gt;* Put another way, it must never be forgotten that the freedom struggle was fundamentally fought to achieve two ends: to drive out the oppressive, alien occupier and to unite India as one nation, a unity that should remain non-negotiable, Jammu and Kashmir included.

&gt;* Its core doctrine is dictated by interference in the affairs of independent nations using whatever tools are deemed fit including think tanks, bureaucracy, local advocacy groups, universities and the media.

&gt;* The role of Amnesty in India can also be examined in tandem in light of its aggressive campaign against denying the US visa to Narendra Modi and its nexus with the global Human Rights Award industry with generous backing of Evangelists of all hues.

&gt; * The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the latest offer of dialogue on Kashmir from Pakistan could progress only if Islamabad stopped the export of terror that hit Kashmir, as well as Mumbai on 26/11, and demanded the earliest possible vacation of PoK [Pakistan-occupied Kashmir].

&gt; * Releasing the contents of the letter that Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar wrote to his Pakistan counterpart Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry on August 16, the MEA demanded the cessation of cross-border terrorism, the closing down of terrorist camps, and denial of safe havens for terrorists.

&gt; * India divulged the details of the letter from Foreign Secretary Jaishankar on Thursday even as Pakistan hit back saying that the latest statements on Balochistan from India crossed a red line. The statement by the Indian Prime Minister [on Balochistan] includes elements that are indeed a violation of the U.N. charter, Nafees Zakaria, spokesperson of the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, said during his weekly briefing in Islamabad.

New Delhi:  Irked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks over adversities faced by the BJP, Congress today hit back, accusing the ruling party's predecessor Jan Sangh and RSS of being ""collaborators"" of the British during the freedom struggle.



Targeting the Prime Minister for ""trivialising"" the freedom struggle, the party said that PM Modi should not only take back his ""shameful"" statement that BJP had faced more adversities in independent India as compared to what Congress did during the British rule, but should also apologise.



""They were collaborators of the British,"" the party's senior spokesman Anand Sharma said, making a scathing attack on Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the Sangh Parivar and Veer Savarkar.



He claimed that Mr Mookerjee wrote to the then Bengal Governor on how to combat the Quit India movement. ""It does not behove the Prime Minister to lower the dignity of his office by making a statement which is factually incorrect and an insult to the freedom fighters, to Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and thousands of others who made manifold sacrifices during India's national struggle,"" he said.



Mr Sharma said the BJP has been in power at the centre or has been part of the governments there or an outside supporter for 13 long years and that was the time that Pandit Nehru spent in jail during the British rule, Mr Sharma said.

""The British Home Department file from 1942 has all the circulars from RSS. The Bombay Home Secretary said the Sangh has scrupulously kept within the law and refrained from taking any part in the disturbances of 1942,"" he said.



He said that RSS decided to not take part in the Quit India Movement and it decreed that no member of the Jan Sangh should participate.



This was there in a letter written by Mr Mookerjee to the British Governor of Bengal, Mr Sharma said.



Noting that BJP and the Prime Minister have tried to appropriate Sardar Patel, he said that Patel's views on RSS can be gauged through an official communique from the Government of India, which banned RSS and Hindu Mahasabha.



""Post India's independence, Modi ji needs to be reminded that his colleagues and his party are direct beneficiaries of India's freedom, India's Constitution, India's democracy which allowed and empowered him, his colleagues, his party..."", Mr Sharma said.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Para commandos of the Indian Army carried out surgical operations deep inside Myanmar early on Tuesday and killed several militants in two camps of northeastern insurgent groups in a covert operation which declared India's new-found readiness to pre-empt terror threats undeterred by borders.The Myanmar government was informed hours after the commandos in battle fatigues had mostly completed surgical strikes against the groups which had over the past couple of weeks killed 30 Indian soldiers.

&gt; * ""While ensuring peace and tranquility along the border and in the border states, any threat to our security, safety and national integrity will meet a firm response,"" the Army declared officially, a posture that is also applicable to terror groups sheltered by other neighbouring countries.The troops were guided to two camps of the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) and allied insurgent groups by intelligence which was gathered by operatives who crossed over into Myanmar a couple of days ago and returned with precise co-ordinates of the terror dens along with photographs.Specific details of the fatalities among the insurgents were not available but sources in home and defence ministries put the toll between 20 and 50.More than the toll, the daring raid, which saw commandos crawling hundreds of meters to raid the camps, marked the unveiling of India's new response to unconventional threats irrespective of where they come from.

&gt; * However, for Tuesday morning operation, government did not inform Myanmar in advance fearing possible leak of information, given the close contact NSCN (K) has with middle and lower level of Myanmar army.Government sources said the political leadership cleared the cross-border pursuit because it was considered necessary to lift the morale of the Army after it lost 30 of its men in 3 attacks by insurgents, as well as to send across a message to ""perpetrators of terror wherever they are"".Explaining Modi government's new stance towards terror threat, a senior official told TOI: ""You cannot realistically hope to prevent each terror attack because the timing and the target is determined by the enemy.

&gt; * In the course of the last few days, credible and specific intelligence was received about further attacks that were being planned within our territory,"" Gen Singh said.Gen Singh said the Indian Army troops ""engaged two separate groups of insurgents along the Nagaland and Manipur borders"" and ""significant casualties have been inflicted on them"".Commandos from the Army's SF units have been operating in northeast for the past several weeks, carrying out surgical strikes on militant hideouts.

  NEW DELHI: When 25-year-old Mazdak Dilshad Baloch arrived in India a few months ago, he raised the suspicion of immigration authorities at the New Delhi airport. Mazdak had a Canadian passport which showed the place of birth as Quetta in Pakistan.  

 

  Mazdak, one of the few Baloch refugees in New Delhi told ET: ""I was at pain explaining to the immigration authority that I was not a Pakistani. Call me a dog, but not a Pakistani. I am a Baloch. Because of my place of birth, I faced a lot of harassment.""  

 

  The story of Mazdak is similar to thousands of Baloch who have sought asylum in different parts of the world after being hounded by the Pakistan army. Mazdak's father was abducted, mother harassed and properties damaged.  

 

  The family had to seek asylum in Canada where they reside now. Mazdak and his wife are in India to create awareness about the Baloch freedom movement.  

 

  They are happy that for the first time in 70 years of their struggle New Delhi has lend open support to their struggle.  

 

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had said: ""I want to express my gratitude to the people of Balochistan, Gilgit and PoK for the way they wholeheartedly thanked me, the way they expressed gratitude to me... People of a distant land I haven't even seen... When they thank the Indian prime minister, it's an honour for the 125 crore people of the country.""  

 

  ETHNIC CLEANSING  

  ""My father Mir Ghulam Mustafa Raisani, a filmmaker, was abducted by the Pakistan army and kept in detention in Quetta between 2006 and 2008. My mother is a political activist.  

 

  After my father was released my parents left for Canada. Pakistan wants ethnic cleansing in Balochistan. They want Balochs to accept Pakistan nationhood or else they kill us. They have committed genocide in our country,"" a distraught Mazdak told ET. The 25-year-old said he fled to Afghanistan in 2010 first.  

 

  With the help of United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) he managed a refugee status and later under the rehabilitation programme migrated to Canada, where thousands of Baloch nationals have found refuge, after a bloodbath that resulted in killings of more than tens of thousands of Balochs.  

 

  ""We want the Government of India to help form a Balochistan government in exile, like the Tibetans. Every Baloch appreciates what Prime Minister Modi has said. Balochs around the world are working towards forming a government in exile,"" Mazdak said.  

 

  NO SCHOOLING  

  Speaking about the struggle in Balochistan, Mazdak said his brothers and sisters did not receive proper schooling. ""I studied at a school in Quetta. But now the situation has worsened. Pakistan has set up madrassas every 10 km in Baloch and want to brainwash innocent youth.""  

 

  ""Because there is no education, there are no jobs. A common Balochi can find only menial job. Islamabad has appointed Pakistani Muslims in all important positions in Balochistan. Its army has created a mess in the entire region. The economic resources of our land are plundered. Pakistan has opened the doors for Chinese companies for mining coal reserves and other natural resources,"" he said.  

 

  PAK ARMY DEFLECTING BLAME  

  Mazdak who migrated to Canada in 2014 said that he was never contacted by any Indian agencies in India or Balochistan.  

 

  When asked about Pakistan's allegations on the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in Balochistan, Mazdak said, ""I am from Baloch and lived there for a very long time there. I have not seen any Indian agent. Nor has anyone contacted me or my family. It is all being done by Pakistan. It is a factory of terrorist.  

 

  Islamabad wants to deflect the blame and blame India's RAW. To my understanding, there has been no support for Balochs from India or Indian agencies in the past 70 years.""  

 

  Blaming Pakistan for the mess in Balochistan, Mazdak said, ""Islamabad has such a tight grip over the region that even the Pakistan media is not allowed free access to the region. Whatever stories on Baloch is first vetted by the Pakistan Army's ISPR. This makes it difficult for locals to voice the atrocities committed by Pakistan. It is also difficult to estimate the numbers of army personnel deployed in the region. If India can give details of Army deployment in Kashmir, why cannot Pakistan reveal the figures in Balochistan?""  

 

  Mazdak alleged that Pakistan forces indulged in organ trade in Balochistan. ""We have seen so many cases and bodies of Baloch nationals abducted, killed and their organs removed.  

 

  We have been trying to raise the issue at the international level.""

73,Because Modi ka chamcha Adani is holding back massive stocks of pulses and selling at high rates. Tur dal would be selling @ 300 Rs/per kg this Diwali.,2016-08-20 16:26:39
74,"Arhar Modi"", Congress on Friday stepped up attack on the government on the issue alleging that the pulses ""crisis"" is a ""man made scam"" of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in which common man was ""robbed"" of by profiteers, hoarders and black marketers.

 Party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala demanded that the Prime Minister must answer and take ""decisive action"" against those who ""fleeced"" the ordinary citizen in the last 15 months.   



 

 ""People of India have paid 150 per cent to 200 per cent extra for pulses alone during 15 months of Modi government ie, April, 2015 to July, 2016. This comes to over Rs 2,50,000 crore for this period. It is a man made crisis of great magnitude and proportion under the very nose of Modi government ...Covert and overt support of the Modi government,"" Surjewala said.

 ""This day light robbery is clearly discernible when one compares the MSP/import price of pulses (even after adding Rs 5 per kg of Processing Fee + Rs 10 per kg of Transportation Charges + Rs 5 per kg of Profit) as against the actual sale price to ordinary consumer"", Surjewala said.

 Noting that the MSP of pulses as also imported pulses was in the range of Rs 40 to Rs 50, he said that this clearly showed that price of domestically produced pulses or imported pulses for the common man cannot be more than Rs 60/65 per kg by any stretch of imagination even after adding 'processing fee', transportation charges' as also 'profit margin'.

 ""As against this, price of pulses has been ranging between Rs 130 to Rs 200 per kg since April, 2015 till today i.e, July, 2016. Hence, it is clear that the average price of pulses has been in the range of Rs 150 per kg in the last 15 months.

 Thus, profiteering of Rs 85/90 per kg (Rs 150 per kg of average price minus Rs 60/65 per kg of final sale price) is writ large."", he alleged.

 He said when multiplied by 23 million tonne (2.30 crore tonne) of annual consumption of pulses, this figure comes to Rs 2,50,000 crore for a 15 months period between April, 2015 to July, 2016.

 He alleged that ""long windows"" of 'no stock limit' in big states of Gujarat and Maharashtra ruled by the BJP were used by hoarders and black marketeers to push the prices of pulses at an insurmountable high of Rs 150 to Rs 200 per kg.

 Elaborating the ""long windows"", he said restriction on stock limits on pulses were lifted by Gujarat government on 30.09.2013, then headed by Narendra Modi as Chief Minister. On 27.09.2013, UPA government decided to extend the validity of restriction on stocking of pulses, edible oils and edible oil seeds for a further one year i.e, 30.09.2013 to 30.09.2014.

 ""Gujarat government headed by Modi, however, refused to extend the order beyond 30.09.2013 despite a specific recommendation by Director, Food &amp; Civil Supplies, Gandhinagar. This is apparent from the copy of documents available under RTI."", he said.

 Similarly, BJP Government of Maharashtra issued an order dated 23.04.2015 removing all stock limits on storage of pulses, thereby discontinuing Congress government's imposed ban of seven years, Surjewala alleged.

 ""Even this was done in a surreptitious manner in as much as the original note dated 11.02.2015 of Secretary, Food &amp; Civil Supplies, Government of Maharashtra was qua lifting of stock limit ban only on edible oils and edible oil seeds. In a surreptitious manner, word 'pulses' was added on 14.02.2015, which was finally approved by Shri Devendra Fadnavis, CM on 18.03.2015"", he claimed.

 Alleging that an organized syndicate of hoarders/importers/select corporates is artificially enhancing the prices, he wanted an independent investigation into the whole issue.

 He said that an organised cartel of hoarders and importers runs across India with tentacles spreading from Myanmar to African continent.

 ""Modus operandi is simple — importers take delivery of pulses stocks and hoard it at foreign ports; Ships from Myanmar carrying tonnes of pulses are halted at port in Singapore; Ships coming from African continent are made to slow down for days together. Aim is to create artificial scarcity in India. Similarly, hoarders stock pulses procured in godowns in different States where there is no stock limit, including sometimes at private ports. This racket continues to thrive,"" he said.

 Surjewala claimed that a big Gujarat traders syndicate called 'ETGWORLD' headed by one Jayesh Patel has been importing 'Arhar (Tur) Dal' from Mozambique at Rs 55 per kg in the year 2015 and is now selling the same at Rs 175 per kg. Adani Wilmar has been using 'ETGWORLD' to source 'Dal' internationally.

 He said it needs to be investigated as to how much quantities of pulses were purchased Nationally and Internationally by Adani Wilmar since formation of joint venture in 2014, including final sale prices of stocks so acquired (which are stated to be in the range of Rs 180 to Rs 200 per kg).

 Besides, he said that in October, 2015; as prices of 'Dal' rose up to Rs 200 per kg, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) inked a pact with 'Indian Pulses and Grain Association' (IPGA) to handle import of pulses across its ports.

 He claimed that this has been duly noted by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), but no action has been taken.

 Taking a dig at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley who had spoken on the issue yesterday, Surjewala said that the Finance Minister does not know in which season pulses are grown.

 Asked whether the party would press for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the issue, he said it was a matter to be decided by the Parliamentary party. ",2016-08-20 16:59:40

Story Highlights
 Boy beaten by men angry at Dalit boycott of picking up carcasses 
 Dalit family had decided to boycott after incident in Una 
 4 Dalit men had been flogged by cow vigilantes last month, sparking angerBhavra, Gujarat: The signs of a brutal assault are all too visible on the body of the 15-year-old Dalit boy. It has been more than 48 hours since he was attacked in his village by two young men infuriated at his family's decision to boycott lifting carcases of animals but he is still in shock.



 
On Thursday, the Class 10 student (name withheld) was buying chocolates from a shop in Bhavra village, 40 km from Ahmedabad, when two men Sahil Thakor and Sarvar Pathan approached him, he said.

""They asked me why we have stopped picking up dead animals. I told him that since the community has given a call we have stopped it. They got angry and started hitting me and later attacked me with a stone,"" the boy told NDTV.



 
He claimed that he had approached the village chief with a complaint but he was ignored.



 
The boy's father, 42-year-old Dinesh Parmar said that the 20 odd families in the village have been left shaken by the incident.



 
Mr Parmar, who works as a farm labourer, says he had stopped picking up carcasses from the village following a boycott call issued by their community after four young Dalit men were beaten up in Una in southern Gujarat on suspicion of cow slaughter by self-styled cow vigilantes last month.



 
""We have decided to boycott the work following the call given by our community and we will continue to do so. But we fear that our families could be attacked further,"" he said.



 
The police have arrested both the accused and are probing complaints against the village chief as well. But Dalit families in the village say they fear retribution by the family members of the accused men.



 
Last weekend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised cow vigilantes or ""gau rakshaks"", stating most use religion as a cover for crimes that have nothing to do with protecting the cow, which is held sacred by Hindus.



 
But the incidents of violence have fed a groundswell of anger in Gujarat among the Dalit community leading to several protests across the state and calls to quit gruelling, poorly-paid jobs forced upon the lowest castes.Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelatedMayawati To Launch UP Campaign With Mega Agra Rally, Signal A ShiftMore StoriesMeet Ryan Lochte, The World's Latest 'Ugly American'NDTV Wins Income Tax Appeal For AY 2007-08Dalit Boy Thrashed In Gujarat After Family Refuses To Pick Up Carcasses

  These questions and these expressions have been heard repeatedly . Recently they were raised after the August 15 reference to Balochistan. Earlier they followed the Nuclear Suppliers' Group (NSG) plenary in Seoul and found mention in analyses of Modi's high-octane international visits.  

 

  How valid is such criticism? The answer requires reflection. True, some of the criticism has come from those politically opposed to Modi and congenitally or even hereditarily hostile to anything he does. Yet, some misgivings have come from veteran diplomats who have served India honestly and purposefully in the past. Many are agnostic to Modi, some may even be sympathetic. Why are they nonplussed?  

 

  Part of it is a caution born of years of seeing things done in a certain manner and using certain protocols - and it must be said that manner and those protocols often worked to India's advantage. Part of it is an inability to understand the instincts of a competitive politician who tends to approach any political engagement - domestic or international - with a transactionalism and a horsesense assessment of immediate and long-term implications, calculating the appropriate mix in his head.  

 

  Such transactionalism and calculations are not unknown to other diplomatic cultures, notably to the United States. Of course, the bureaucracy in the State Department could think differently and offer more measured advice to a president who may have his reasons for foreign policy innovation. This is not to suggest that the formal diplomatic corps is irrelevant and outdated. It's just that its professional judgment will be adhered to, tweaked or even side-stepped given the priorities of the president (or in India's case prime minister).  

 

  All of this has happened in the past. It happened when Manmohan Singh risked substantial slices of his precious political capital on the nuclear deal, despite influential sections of the Ministry Of External Affairs counselling a plan B.It happened when Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in his second month in office, went ahead with Pokhran II. If he had consulted the MEA, asked it to prepare the ground and suggest an appropriate date for the nuclear tests, the recommendation would never have come.  

 

  In Modi's case, these impulses have got accentuated because of his background as a chief minister who pushed his civil servants in Gujarat to take his chosen projects to fruition, rather than barricaded himself in their counsel.He has brought this experience to diplomacy . Does that mean he is better than all his predecessors and always right? Not necessarily. More than about him being right or wrong, this is about understanding what he is.  

 

  It is pointless to look at Modi through a prism that existed before him - and may well be reincarnated with a future PM - and despair that he is not acting as previous PMs have or in the manner that the ""strategic community"" in Delhi would expect and want him to. This reflects a failure of several very fine foreign policy minds to sufficiently study and relate to how domestic politics works and shapes decision-making. You don't have to agree, but there is a need to attempt to understand.  

 

  Many leaders have driven foreign policy initiatives that they believe in but which run counter to diplomatic wisdom or Foreign Office institutional memory . Modi has indicated a shift with his Balochistan gambit. Singh did this with the nuclear deal. A contentious example would be Tony Blair's advocacy of the Iraq intervention. On another scale, a well-intentioned but missed opportunity was Woodrow Wilson's failure to have the Treaty of Versailles ratified in his own backyard.  

 

  In terms of Modi's ""personalising"" of diplomacy , there are two issues to note.First, Modi came to office with both a curiosity and an ignorance about him. He leveraged that to his advantage, recognising he could do it for the first two or three years but not beyond.  

 

  Not since Jawaharlal Nehru has a PM made his personal narrative such a force multiplier for diplomacy. This is not to compare Nehru and Modi - that is another argument, for another day. It is only to emphasise that the conditions under which they took office, Nehru in the 1940s and Modi after the mandate of 2014, allowed them a clean-sheet redesign. Such an option was neither available to nor actively sought by PMs in between. Chad Modi used the chance to pertinaciously cultivate a rapport with key counterparts.  

 

  With Barack Obama it worked; with Xi Jinping it has not always worked.  

 

  Further, there was a realistic, perhaps cynical recognition that for all the talk of institutions, personalities still drive foreign policy . When Modi visited Central Asia, often the only interlocutor was the individual country's (elected) strongman: no number two, no leader of opposition, nothing.  

 

  Second, Modi is a general who likes to get into the trenches and not sit in a war room a thousand miles away. This is not the only template for diplomatic leadership, but it is the one he has chosen. It led him to invest heavily in the NSG campaign, and he took the consequences. Do remember though that it also led him to invest heavily in the resolution of the nuclear liabilities mess with the US and not leave it to an interminable ""negotiating process"".  

 

  India is reaping the benefits.

 Every four years, a nation of 1.2 billion struggles to win medals at the Olympics. Some unfairly lash out at the players on social media. Other self-righteous types talk about how we should encourage our players, how at least we participated, and that is what finally matters. Frankly , none of it is relevant or will help us win medals. So what will it take for India to not just win a bronze and a silver but a dozen golds and three dozen medals in all (yes, it is possible!) at the Olympics?

 

 Let's first look at some common reasons cited for our poor performance (and why they are wrong).These are: we don't have money for sports (we actually don't need to spend that much on a per capita basis), we don't have good genes (bizzare, as Indians are a very large and diverse gene pool), parents don't encourage kids to play sports as it has no future (partly true, but the same is the case abroad. For instance, silver-medallist rowers won't have a lavish future awaiting them anywhere in the world).

 

 In reality , there are three main reasons why we suck at the Olympics...

 

 We just don't care much about Olympic sports (except when the Olympics is on and that is the cool thing to do).

 

 We don't value excellence in society as much.Jugaad and mediocrity often work just fine, though they can't get us medals.

 

 We don't spend enough or in the right direction to win Olympic medals.

 

 The first two are societal values. They will change slowly , over time. The third, how we spend on sports, is the focus here. We have to understand the difference between spending on competitive sports and on sports in general. Sports is not all competition, it is also for recreation and exercise, which is also important. For instance, we need to have jogging tracks in parks. These may not yield world-class athletes, but will make the neighbourhood fitter. On the other hand, it also costs a lot to train athletes to win a medal on the world stage. What should we do? There is no easy answer. You need a bit of both.

 

 Right now, however, the need of the hour is to end this humiliation. If India wins a dozen golds, it will have huge benefits. It will put the country on the global map. It will motivate millions of youth.It will invoke a stronger national identity in us. Even politically , a leader like Narendra Modi positions himself on making India glorious. This is one way of doing so.

 

 It is important to see some numbers. Australia, with a mere 20 million population, averages around 50 medals in every Olympics. The total amount it spends on sports: around Rs 700 crore, of which 80% (Rs 560 crore) goes into Olympic sports.

 

 India has averaged two medals in every Olympics in the last two decades. The amount we spend? Well, the carve-out for sports in the youth and sports ministry budget is about Rs 900 crore. Of this, over two-thirds goes in organizing local-level tournaments (not meant to yield Olympic winners), giving prizes, upgrading stadiums, and schemes like uplifting the Northeast. Only around Rs 300 crore is available for actually improving the level of sport. It isn't clear how much of that is going into Olympic-level training. The talent search budget for the entire nation, for instance, was only Rs 5 crore. Either way , even at a grossly over-estimated Rs 300 crore, the amount on a per sport basis for the 20-odd Olympic sports, is only Rs 15 crore. So we have a national budget of Rs 15 crore for, say, swimming, a sport where you can win a ton of medals. That probably just pays for the salaries of babus associated with the sport. Hence, the amount left to find and train new players is nothing. Good luck finding Olympic champions with that! Australia, on the other hand, spends a far less absolute amount, but has lower overheads, lesser corruption and is clear about its goal -Olympics.

 

 India can do the same. For one, we need a separate budget, say the Indian Olympics Fund, for Olympic talent scouting and training (versus that for promoting sports in general). This budget should be at least Rs 10,000 crore per year. It sounds like a lot but is only Rs 80 per Indian on a per capita basis.

 

 Something like a Nandan Nilekani-Aadhar setup, where the Olympics Fund is managed by external professionals, would keep things more honest and efficient. The 10,000 crore would be spent in three parts. One, to identify and maintain a talent pool of 5,000 elite sportspersons (called Elite5000) in the country , preferably in medal-heavy events (swimming, cycling, etc). Two, to pay for the Elite5000 scholarships and education so they don't have to worry about money or having a job later. Three, to give world-class training to Elite5000, of which say 300 will make up the Indian contingent at the Olympics.Such a setup will certainly win us a dozen golds.

 

 Medals do not just come from a) having a fighting spirit, b) being emotionally patriotic, c) cheering our players on social media or d) turning individual sporting heroes into media stars. These things help, but they are and should be a given. Medals will come if we implement the Indian Olympics Fund in the manner prescribed above. Now tell me, are you ready to pay Rs 80 per year to feel the pride of India winning a dozen gold medals at every Olympics?

  By Amulya Ganguli  

 

  Even as Sonia Gandhi prepares to pass the baton to her children in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh elections, it is obvious that she is not only opting for semi-retirement a few years too early but also that she is leaving the Congress in more of a derelict state than ever before in its 131 years.  

 

  At 69, Sonia is only four years older than Narendra Modi. In the normal course, she could have carried on for several more years.  

 

  But indifferent health has apparently forced her to opt for a change of guard at the party's helm with Rahul Gandhi being groomed to take over as the party chief, although there is little doubt that she will continue to play a major role in the Congress and in the country's politics in the foreseeable future.  

 

  When the history of these times is written, her retreat from formal leadership will however be seen to have taken place when the party is going downhill. She will not be handing over a healthy organization to her children but an ailing one.  

 

  From this standpoint, her stewardship can be said to have marked the twilight period of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. There is little doubt that Sonia Gandhi will be held responsible by chroniclers for this sad state of affairs if only because she has been -- and still is -- in sole command of the party. As a result, its successes and failures cannot but be attributed to her.  

 

  It was in 2004 that the Congress tasted success under her leadership. But hindsight suggests that it was an achievement by default rather than on its own steam.  

 

  According to Atal Behari Vajpayee, the BJP's defeat was the result of popular anger and disenchantment caused by the Gujarat riots.  

 

  As the Hindutva storm-troopers violated the raj dharma of neutrality in Gujarat, the Congress gained by being in the right place at the right time.  

 

  With Sonia Gandhi's popularity ratings second only to Vajpayee's at the time, it was evident that the electorate voted for her rather than for the Congress.  

 

  The success of 2004 was confirmed by an even bigger victory in 2009 when the Congress crossed the 200-seat mark in the Lok Sabha. The party seemed to be going from strength to strength.  

 

  But, then, the wheels began to turn and the decline which began from 2011-12 is still continuing. There is little doubt that Sonia Gandhi is responsible for this slide. A major reason is the disconnect between her and the popular preference for economic reforms.  

 

  As a recent book on P.V. Narasimha Rao has pointed out, a sizable section of Congressmen were against the then prime minister opening up the economy.  

 

  Indeed, Sonia and the anti-reforms Congressmen still live in the 1970s and 1980s. Unfortunately for them, India has moved on -- a trend which Narendra Modi detected and capitalized on with his pitch for development. The Congress, therefore, has been left behind.  

 

  But economic obtuseness is not the only reason the party has floundered under Sonia Gandhi. An even greater blunder is her unwillingness to build up a second rung of leadership apart from her own children.  

 

  Even there, Sonia Gandhi apparently prefers to distinguish between Rahul and Priyanka although the latter is palpably more popular among the party's rank and file and the people in general.  

 

  Sonia Gandhi appears to have acquired the trait of backing members of the family from her imperious mother-in-law, who also pushed her sons to the forefront instead of allowing the provincial leaders to play a larger role in national politics as in the early days of the Congress.  

 

  While Indira Gandhi groomed Sanjay first and then Rajiv to step into her shoes, Sonia Gandhi wants Rahul Gandhi to take over with Priyanka Vadra following some distance behind.  

 

  The disastrous fallout of this obsession with the dynasty is obvious. The consequences are all the more unfortunate because Rahul Gandhi lacks the charisma of his forebears.  

 

  However, it will not do to blame Sonia Gandhi alone for the Congress's plight. An equal responsibility has to be borne by the senior party members, none of whom has had the guts to point out to her the follies of her ways.  

 

  It is only pressure from below which has led to Priyanka Vadra being given a greater role in the Uttar Pradesh elections. Being more of an amiable, ""natural"" politician than her grumpy brother, the ordinary members of the party feel that she will fetch more votes than Rahul Gandhi.  

 

  Any other party or its leader would have banked on the personable Priyanka Vadra long ago to turn the organization's fortune around. But Sonia Gandhi's preference for her son has made her back him -- even if his inadequacies are evident.  

 

  The Congress, at the moment, is hoping for Modi to stumble so that it can find its way back to power. But the prime minister has been reasonably steady on his feet so far, although the Hindutva hotheads have been trying to queer the pitch for him with their anti-Muslim and anti-Dalit antics.  

 

  The Congress, therefore, is facing a bleak autumn with an even more depressing political winter before it.

&gt; * However, Pakistan's NSG bid was not discussed at length, however the presence of the application was the reason for a lot of discussion oncountries.China's continued obduracy raises serious questions in the Indian government about the value of organisations like BRICS, RIC or even BASIC, where India and China are believed to be working together.

Yes. Yes. Let the hate flow through you ... but not just against the govt. The govt. certainly deserves it, but hating the govt. will make no change. You will just end up voting for another bunch of socialist pigs (or socialists-in-capitalist-skins like how-to-go-beyond-35-percent-vote-share Modi, or educated-class-swayers-with-swaraj-crap-turned-freebie-givers like Kejriwal) after 3 years. 

Instead, direct your hate where you can take some action. Against everyone else who is evading taxes. For e.g. your local grocery shop, your OLA drivers, your small-clinic doctor. 

Avoid going to these places. Go to big brand alternatives. Stop buying stuff from your local grocery shop. Stop going to your local doctor. Stop paying in cash to your OLA drivers. Heck, if possible do a money transfer to your maid's account. 

If you have all white money (assuming you are a simple salaried person and not some businessmen) then please use credit card everywhere (unless you are buying something which you want to be private). 

A cash-driven society will always have black money and corruption. A purely cashless society will be a privacy nightmare. But, having the freedom to choose is probably the best (like in most countries which do not have low-level corruption/black money).

147,"#Kerala to be first 'open defecation-free' state with 1.9 lakh new toilets by November

___

[IMAGE 1](http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-53794563,width-310,resizemode-4,imglength-79701/toilet.jpg)

  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala is gearing up to be declared as the first 'open defecation-free', among the most populous states in the country with the completion of 1.90 lakh toilets in its 941 village panchayats by this November.  

 

  The toilets are being constructed across the state, including in individual houses, located at critically challenged and hilly terrains, as part of the sanitation programme by the state government.  

 

 Suchitwa Mission, the state nodal agency for sanitation, is implementing the plan which has a total outlay of Rs 308 crore.  

 

  K Vasuki, Executive Director, Suchitwa Mission, said it was a tough and challenging task to implement the open defecation-free (ODF) programme in a state like Kerala, which is one of the most populous ones in the country having different geographical terrain ranging from hillocks to coastal regions.  

 

  ""Though it was a challenging task, we are committed and confident that the state would achieve the new milestone by this November,"" Vasuki told PTI.  

 

  ""Our target is to construct nearly 1.90 lakh (toilets) across the 941 gram panchayats in the state. Of this, construction of 35 per cent of toilets has already been completed and work of nearly 70,000 is progressing,"" she said.  

 

  ""Nearly 50 gram panchayats have already self-declared as 'OFD civic bodies',"" she said.  

 

  Stating that the mission was getting full support from the CPIM-led LDF government in the state, she said the government took strong decision to complete various initiatives under the programme on a war-footing.  

 

  ""Orders were issued that there should not be any financial restrictions for the project,"" she said, adding, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was monitoring the scheme's progress every week.  

 

  The OFD programme in the state got a boost after Vijayan met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, immediately after assuming office in May last.  

 

  ""First the state government will declare Kerala as open defecation-free on November 1. Later, a central team will visit the state and endorse the declaration after making mandatory inspections in this regard,"" she said.  

 

  Referring to the challenges faced, Vasuki said construction of toilets in certain areas, especially in areas like water-logged, water scarcity and hilly regions, caused technical difficulties at various stages of the ongoing work.  

 

  ""We have overcome the challenges by adopting suitable construction methods and region-friendly toilet designs after seeking the advise of technical experts,"" she said.  

 

  As part of the programme, the Mission is also planning a post ODF programme, that includes creating awareness about the sanitation and other related matters among public.  

 

  About 39,000 individual house-hold latrines would be readied in critical and geographically challenging areas with the completion of the project. Even vulnerable communities living in far off places like Attappady and Kadamakuty would benefit from this.  

 

  Suchitwa Mission is constituted under local self-government with the vision of creating a waste-free, unpolluted Kerala with an emphasis on developing public hygiene and cleanliness.  

 

  The Mission's work would enable a better quality of life for the people of Kerala through improved health and general well-being, economic gains, environmental beautification and overall environmental upgradation, Vasuki said, detailing the agency's nature of work.  

 

  ""The mission is entrusted to provide technical and financial support to the local self-government bodies for establishing facilities for waste management and sanitation,"" she said.  

 

  Based on analysis and verification, Suchitwa mission would provide technical and financial sanction to the projects submitted by local bodies and also disburse financial assistance in installments to them, she added.

---

&gt;* Weeks after the Indian government cleared the deployment of a special version of the BrahMos cruise missile in the northeast, China has warned that such a move would have a negative influence on stability along the border.

&gt;* Earlier this month, the cabinet committee on security, which is chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the raising of a new regiment to be equipped with an advanced version of the BrahMos developed for mountain warfare at a cost of more than Rs 4,300 crore.

&gt;* A commentary over the weekend in the PLA Daily, the official publication of Peoples Liberation Army, said the deployment of the supersonic cruise missiles could lead to counter-measures by China.

&gt;* The piece noted other steps taken by India to beef up its capabilities along the border with China, such as the deployment of UAVs and Su-30 combat jets, and claimed such moves were part of a policy of counterbalance and confrontation.

&gt;* The Indian Army has so far raised three regiments equipped with two earlier versions of the BrahMos, which was jointly developed by India and Russia and is named after the Brahmaputra and Moskva rivers.

.",2016-08-22 20:01:32
164,"&gt;Why did he open his mouth against his employer? ?? Really?

Yes, really. His statements about intolerance, one eyed men, and poor analogies with Nazi Germany, etc. were out of line, embarrassed the government time and again, and undermined public confidence. You could say that the media misrepresented his words; but he should have quickly realised that media fanboyism was only hurting him and he should have spoken with greater discretion after that. He didn't. 

&gt;His employers are the people of India and his fiduciary duty is to do what's best for the people of India from a monetary policy stand point.

His employer is the Government of India. His duty is not ""to do what's best for the people of India"", because that's a vague definition. The RBI is supposed to carry out a very specific set of functions.

&gt;Modi and his cronies wanted lower interest rates and easy loans.

Bullshit. ""Modi and his cronies"" [supported Rajan](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-backed-rbi-chief-raghuram-rajan-in-turf-war-with-finance-ministry-report-761121) against senior party members. Both [Modi and Jaitley](http://www.firstpost.com/business/raghuram-rajan-exit-rbi-governor-used-as-ploy-to-score-political-goal-against-modi-govt-2844988.html) have backed him up more than once.

_""there have been occasions when there have been animated discussions between the officials in the Finance Ministry and those of the RBI over the anti-inflationary measures – such as cuts in rates of interests – but ultimately the views of Rajan have prevailed, with both Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley standing by him.""_

&gt; Was Subbu swamy being goaded by Modi and co? Looks like it.

Doesn't look like it. It looks more like Swamy was taking potshots at Jaitley by targeting ""Jaitley's man"": Rajan.

&gt;Should he have spoken out about the numbers being cooked? Yes.

The numbers weren't cooked and he never ""spoke out"" about them being cooked. It's amaturs and political hacks with a _very_ limited understanding of GDP numbers that put a spin on his words. Read his exact words [here](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/raghuram-rajan-sceptical-about-gdp-calculation/).

_""So, in that sense we have to be a little careful about how we count GDP because some time we get growth because people (are) moving into different areas. It is important that when they move into different areas they are actually doing something which is more value added...""_

&gt;Why should an noted economist, who is doing a good job, be taking advice from a lawyer; jaitley about monetary policy?

Are you seriously asking why a government employee, who has been _appointed_ to a post, should consult with an elected official, the finance minister of India, and his boss?

166,"Bernard ji you make a lot of good point and a few absurd claims.

1. The peace offerings from bjp were made only after Rajan had announced his intentions not to take up an extension. Modi did not speak up ever in rajans support.

2. Rajan was dignified enough not to respind to swamys vapid attacks.

3. The world over the fiscal policy is controlled by the government and the monetary policy by the central banks. This is not by accident. This arrangement ensures that there are enough checks and balances in the economy. Other wise, for example,  what stops the government from just printing money to wipe out it's deficit? You can flush the economy with money and inflation rises. Inflation is a tax on the common man and that is a reason monetary supply is controlled by central banks. Rajan was vocal about inflation targetting and keeping interest rates high. Jaitley, not an economist, was more vocal , almost disgraciously, in getting rajan to change his stance. He said so in his interviews. 

 Bernard ji i assume you being a knowlegable member of the sub would not call rajan a jaitley man. Rajan was broght in by UPA.

Jaitley had the backing of a clique of industrialists and media. 

Jaitley also has been trying to get more government control of the RBI with the committee model being propsed and the government getting absay in the appointments.

Finally, to your point about towards whom Rajan's fiduciary duties are. It is always the people of the country not some political party. The politicians are also supposed to be public servants but we know better now.

Every finance guy is taught ethics in every course. He is taught about his fiduciary duties and what to do in a conflict of interest etc.

Rajan has been dignified beyond his duty and has taken the moral high road. He is the guy this country needed but not the guy this country deserves.

Sources say the PM is displeased and has conveyed this in strict terms within the party. ",2016-08-22 23:23:05
171,"This article finally hammers home a lot of thoughts I was having about the whole RBI Governor business.

&gt;By choosing Raghuram Rajan's trusted lieutenant Urjit Patel as his successor at Mint Street, the Centre has sent two unequivocal messages. One to the market and another to political rivals. And as an unintended consequence, Patel's appointment also exposes some ""court intellectuals"" and opinion-makers whose public flogging of Narendra Modi on l'affaire Rajan now appears baseless and motivated — just another symptom of their congenital Modiphobia. 

And 

&gt;And it also indicates that more than flamboyance — in 44 months as deputy governor, Patel has one speech to show on RBI's website, compared to 38 for Rajan whose oratory has ranged from Francis Fukuyama's political thoughts to Brexit and tolerance in societies — the government lays greater stress on an ability to keep the head down and do the job.

This is what I always thought about this: The Modi government wanted Rajan's policies and credentials but without the media drama that came from him giving controversial public statements on dozens of issues unrelated to the RBI and Monetary Policies. That's why Urjit Patel was chosen: To continue doing the job but quietly.",2016-08-23 00:00:41
172,"Saar, Rajan came to be considered ""Jaitley's man"" by the likes of Swamy because the two developed a good working relationship in spite of their differences. He may have been a UPA appointee, but by all indications, the NDA leadership was glad to have him around. 

Jaitley and Modi backed his stance long before the controversy surroundign his departure broke out.

Regarding Swamy, you and I are on the same page. His attacks are at times not worth responding to which is what Rajan _and_ Jaitley did. Remember he called the latter Shakuni Mama. Publicly, at that!

Lastly, I do not agree that Rajan has been ""dignified beyond his duty"". IMO, he let his ""rock star"" image go to his head and made indiscreet comments about things that did not concern him. He paid the price for that. Unfortunate, but not a huge deal for the country. Patel's appointment shows that they can get equally competent people to take up the role. Conversely, can Rajan be appointed to the slot of lead central banker again? I doubt it.

174,"Yes, I agree, he was expressing an opinion which in the context can be seen to be critical of the government.  But it was not explicitly critical.  It was, e.g., no worse than Modi keeping mum when Swami was hurling abuse at RR.

Removing an RBI Governor for such mild expressions of opinions is unwarranted.  Any reasonable government needs to be able to tolerate such differences of opinion.

175,"I don't think you understand how PR machinery works. PR teams are given a general direction by the PM but he/she don't look over every single PR release. That's highly impossible. (Fbook, twitter, Linkedin...so many various releases) So it's factually incorrect for you to assume as much. Also dragging him into micro-failures because of what his PR team releases is silly. It's just mud-slinging at the end of the day and frustration which I understand. It doesn't really solve the problem let alone start a discussion on how to solve the problem. I don't love or hate Modi but I do find it silly to blame him for every little loss just the way I find it hard to credit him for every little gain. Hope you understand my point.

And what more proof do we want that the Govt. wanted the RBI's inflation control policies but without getting Shobaa's pussy wet (until, Urjit decides to hit the gym and bulk up a bit, unless of course it was the TamBrah genes triggering her juices)

---

&gt; * In his Independence Day address on Monday, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi went on the offensive vis--vis neighboring Pakistan, suggesting that India could overtly support separatist groups in the Pakistani province of Balochistan and cause trouble in the regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, claimed by India.

&gt; * Modis salvo at Pakistan was driven by two main motivations: one, to deflect pressure on his government for the ongoing crisis in Indian-controlled Kashmir; and two, to project India as a regional hegemon capable of denying China access to economic trade routes through Pakistan into the Indian Ocean region.

&gt; * And rather than engaging Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir, Modi has opted for a defensive offensive approach by vocalizing Indias support for separatist groups in Pakistan.

&gt; * But Pakistan has no hand in the Kashmir protests.

  NEW DELHI: The government in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region has sought India's security-related assistance in the fight against the Islamic State as well as humanitarian aid for thousands who have taken refuge there after fleeing from IS-controlled territories in Iraq and Syria.  

 

  The request from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) comes ahead of the ongoing Iraq trip of MJ Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs, in the first highlevel visit from India to the embattled country in years. The KRG has sought humanitarian aid to help provide food, medicines and other essentials to more than 1.8 million refugees who have taken shelter in the region after fleeing the areas occupied by IS, Indian officials said.  

 

 Falah Mustafa Bakir, who heads the Department of Foreign Relations in the regional government, recently met Deepak Miglani, the newly appointed Consul General of India in the Kurdistan capital of Erbil, to explain the role of Kurdish armed forces in the fight against IS, the officials said. In 2014, the KRG had played a key part in securing the release of nurses from Kerala who were caught in an area that the IS had taken control of.  

 

  The Indian security establishment has been in touch with their counterparts in KRG to locate 39 Indians still missing in Iraq's conflict zone. Kurdistan expects Delhi to provide hardware for the fight against IS, the sources here said. While India has conveyed its solidarity with the KRG in the fight against IS and wants to deepen its political and economic engagement with the region, the Narendra Modi government has not made up its mind on the request for military assistance, they said.

After BJP came to power the highway has improved a lot. Crucial flyovers like the one near Dahruhera, near Hyatt Gurgaon were completed rapidly after BJP came to power. Work on Hero Honda flyover started only after gadkri made a visit after becoming minister.

&gt; * Between 2001 and 2011, growth in jobs was abysmal in all four states ranging between 2.6% in Rajasthan and 2.2% in UP and MP, quite close to the national average of 2 percent.Between 2005-06 and 2013-14, the respective economies of the states grew at an average of about 17% annually in UP and Bihar, about 15% in MP and just over 18% in Rajasthan.

NEW DELHI: Bihar has been battling floods despite receiving less than normal rains this year. Long at the receiving end due to release of water from Nepal, this time though the blame lies squarely on mismanagement of a dam and a barrage in neighbouring states of Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.



The situation has become so bad in the past four days that state chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday rushed to Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention to get immediate help and look for a long-lasting solution in the form of a national policy on silt management.



The Bansagar dam had been accumulating water for the past over one month. But it started releasing water only when it was 95.22% full and had little capacity to store any more water. The dam authority had opened 16 of its 18 gates on August 19, releasing a huge amount of water in one go. It led to the Ganga rising to unprecedented levels in Patna and elsewhere in Bihar and UP.



Release of water from the Bansagar dam in Madhya Pradesh along the Sone in an unregulated manner has even flooded certain areas in Uttar Pradesh. ""If Bansagar dam had not released water during this period of floods in the downstream area, the unprecedented floods in Bihar and UP could have been avoided. It shows mismanagement of the dam by Bansagar Control Board where Bihar is also a party to it along with MP and UP,"" said environmentalist and water conservationist Himanshu Thakkar.



An absence of a national policy on silt management has made the situation worse where most of the rivers including Ganga and Sone were choked wih silt, points out Thakkar, river expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP). He said the drainage congestion and siltation in Ganga, created by Farakka barrage, led to an avoidable disaster in Bihar this year.



Bihar's chief minister is learnt to have raised these issue during his meeting with the Prime Minister and also linked Modi government's ambitious 'Namami Gange' project with better silt management. He also submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister, highlighting the problem of excessive deposit of silt.



""Presently, the main reason for the flood in Ganga is the excessive deposit of silt in the river due to the construction of Farakka barrage. We need to re-evaluate the need of the barrage. Looking at it practically, the situation created by it has more ill-effects than benefits. Hence it will be appropriate that the Centre seriously consider the issue of removing the barrage,"" he said in a memorandum.



Thakkar said, ""These are very legitimate demands of Bihar chief minister. We also need to pay heed to his demand for a national silt management policy"".

250,"Yes they cannot be evaluated. Beggars don't have choices. This is the govt that is doing *something*. I don't care what domain they are focusing on as long as they are doing something because we are headed towards improvement in that domain. 

Politics and country welfare are not push button implementations. You need to navigate political structure, whatever crap the other parties are saying, whatever crap the news is saying, avoiding dead ends in your own party and then you need to do whatever you can. 

Is he taking the ideal steps for country welfare? Probably not. There are a 100 things that are important and all of them need to be done. Maybe he's working on something else but it's way better than that chutiya Sardar we had earlier.

Let me ask you a question. Who are you or I to discuss what modi should be doing? Are you aware of how the decisions are taken or how it feels like being in the middle of problems both in your own party and in the opposing party? If you ever have to work as a public figure where the media is ready to twist your words then you will understand. That time you will probably do very little work and still be happy saying ""I was able to do this much in spite of all these people around creating problems"".

Politics is not like physics where you have only one formula. It is complex. If you want to discuss then discuss the idea, don't start complaining about what modi is doing or what he's not doing (see your first post). Because then you just angry and making others also angry.

252,"I work in this area in a big 4. 

Most of times the vision comes from the top... Politicians and top bureaucrats. However, government departments are severely unequipped to develop a comprehensive strategy. That's where consulting firms come in.

Let me give you an example. Mr. Modi has come up with a lot of buzz words. Have you heard of smart cities? A Smart City is a buzz word. There is no definition of a Smart City. Mr. Modi says that we'll develop smart cities in India. Now if a leader says something, then the civil servants have to obey. So they go about defining what exactly would be smart for their city.

The IAS officer in this case has an unenviable task of deciding which infrastructure to upgrade to ""smart"" levels. He doesn't want to alienate any line department, he has to serve his entire career in the state. So he hires consultants to do ""studies"". Studies here is in quotes because at least half of what the consultant writes is fed to him by the client himself. In other words, the consultant is a shield for the IAS officer. 

The report is presented to the top ministers, and after their approval, a Smart City strategy is published.",2016-08-24 09:28:40

&gt; * While foreign policy is determined by national governments and driven by national interests, it remains to be seen whether the next government in Indian Punjab will attempt to play a constructive role in giving a boost toeconomic ties between both countries, or will preferto be a quiet bystander.

&gt;* A large group of persons residing in PoK have also been raisingslogans in praise of India and Indian government.

&gt;* This has resulted in the USA ending its USD 300 million aid to the Pakistan military and calling off of the F-16 deal at subsidized price.

New Delhi:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pipped Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan to become the most followed Indian on social media site Twitter.



As on August 25, PM Modi had over 22.1 million followers on the social networking platform, while Mr Bachchan marginally trailed with 22 million at the last count.



In January, PM Modi's Twitter followers surpassed that of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. PM Modi, then, became the second most followed Indian on Twitter with over 17,371,600 followers, compared to Mr Khan's 17,351,100.



Now, Mr Khan is the third most followed Indian on Twitter with 20.9 million users of the social media site following him.



The number of followers of PM Modi's account @narendramodi consistently increased by about a million every two months in 2015. It crossed the 15 million mark on September 22 last year, and touched 16 million on November 20.



In 2016, the growth rate of PM Modi's Twitter followers slowed down, with about 5 million users being added in around eight months.



Active on Twitter since 2009, PM Modi is also the second most followed politician in the world, right after US President Barack Obama @barackobama, as per Twitter.

 TAG START { player: ""17689-807137-NDTV Inside Story Pages"", owner: ""ONE Video by AOL"", for: ""ONE Video by AOL"" - BEINJS }  TAG END { date: 07/29/16 } 

PM Modi has used Twitter for campaigns like #MakeInIndia, #SwachBharat, #MannKiBaat and #SelfieWithDaughter to reach and connect with citizens.



Government is encouraging people and officials to use Twitter to communicate with each other.

I do get occasional messages from people admitting how they got carried away by the hatred.

Generalizing an entire community. I still remember the ignorant comments you made on that Urdu daily thing about Muslims not being native etc. 

&gt;Absolutely convinced of their superiority and stubbornness to **integrate** in any meaningful manner.

You are a hindutva supporter. Similar to a Islamist. Your comment on Janmastami thread about ghar wapsi confirms it.  You are the one who is stubborn and thinks muslims are inferior invaders and not natives. 

You blame muslims for ghazni etc. Why don't you then blame all hindus currently for marathas because they invaded bengal and massacred them? Why don't you blame all Hindus because Marathas attacked and destroyed adi shankara's mutt. If someone comes on TV and praises the Marathas do you start blaming all Hindus.  Do you blame all the Hindus and generalize them for 2002 massacre or the numerous riots? Or all Hindus for child marriage in India, caste violence or gau rakshaks beating up people? Maya Kodnani was voted the minister despite massacring muslims in gujarat. She won the elections two times in 2002 and 2007. Now do you go and blame all Hindus in India for it because they voted her two times and modi made her a minister. And here you are complaining about something which happened 1000 of years ago while you support persons like modi who made kodnani a minister and let riots happen in the state. 

If some gau rakshaks beat up people do you go and say Hindus are not integrated and are beating up people? If someone lynches people for eating beef and someone on TV praises them(which has happened), do you go and say all Hindus are praising people who lynch beef eaters? But you will not do that. It's only reserved for muslims. 

People like you and your ideology are responsible for all the shit happening in India. 

If someone here still thinks you are not a bigoted ignorant person, here. You are the guy who thinks muslims are not native to India and your idea of being Indian is the one who worships Ram and Sita and has names like Dilip and Ashok.

Offensive defence. The phrase is an oxymoron that originates from the adage, ""the best defence is a good offence"". The principle behind it is to be proactive rather than passive when attacked, thereby regaining the strategic advantage and cramping an opponent's ability to launch a counter-offensive. Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu was a key advocate of this idea, as was Italian philosopher and diplomat Niccolo Machiavelli. George Washington had employed it to good effect more than 200 years ago when he fought America's War of Independence. Mao Zedong, too, was a firm believer of the tactic while leading the 1949 Chinese Revolution.

Narendra Modi joins the long list of leaders who have sought to employ this curiously phrased approach to their advantage. In his Independence Day address this year, Modi stunned the Pakistani ruling establishment, which had launched a major international offensive against India following the recent turmoil in Kashmir, by signalling his willingness to take the battle deep into its territory.From the ramparts of the Red Fort, Modi stated: ""Today, I want to greet and express my thanks to some people. In the last few days, the people of Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir have thanked me, have expressed gratitude, and expressed good wishes for me. The people who are living far away, whom I have never seen, never met-such people have expressed appreciation for the Prime Minister of India, for 125 crore countrymen. This is an honour for our countrymen.""

This is an honour for our countrymen.""MODI'S BOLD GAMBIT



MODI'S BOLD GAMBITModi's mention of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) was par for the course, as India always regarded reclaiming Gilgit-Baltistan as the ""unfinished business of Partition"". But making common cause with the people of the troubled Balochistan province of Pakistan infuriated Islamabad and startled capitals across the world. The ostensible reason was the alleged human rights violations by the Pakistan Army against the protesters who were demanding azadi. But it was viewed as more than just a tit-for-tat response to Pakistan's charges of 'brutality' by the Indian security forces in the Kashmir Valley. Modi was clearly warning Pakistan that India was changing the rules of engagement from its current posture of conciliation to an offensive defence. India was now willing to get tough-and rough, if needed. The implication was that India had decided to make it a costly proposition for Pakistan to back terror groups and strikes.

By upping the ante, the Indian prime minister had slapped the Pakistan Army, particularly its chief Raheel Sharif, with a direct challenge. The army had thwarted any effort by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to improve relations with India and is suspected to have engineered the attack on the Pathankot air base this January. India was indicating that it was willing to stir the pot in territories far removed from the Line of Control (LoC). In doing so, Modi was making an audacious gambit fraught with risks.There were questions raised about whether this was more of a tactical manoeuvre by India to deflect world attention from the ongoing turmoil in Kashmir. Also, whether Modi had thought through taking on Pakistan and China simultaneously, as the move also challenged Beijing's vital interests in Balochistan. It raised several other concerns: How can India seek world action against Pakistan's continuing perfidy if it is also seen to be backing separatists? Would India cede the moral high ground in its war against terror if it got involved in Balochistan? Also, if Pakistan raised the stakes and carried out a series of attacks on Indian territory, was India prepared to retaliate strongly and even risk a nuclear war?

Opposition parties have charged Modi with following a ""yo-yo policy"" with Pakistan that is largely knee-jerk, lacks cohesion and has no long-term strategy. Modi backers quote Churchill's dictum that ""consistency is the virtue of only donkeys"". A senior official points out, ""You cannot be brain-dead to what the other guy is doing. If the situation is rapidly changing in Pakistan, how can your policy not change? Should we be consistent if Pakistan is inconsistent?""

But the mood changed when foreign secretary-level talks were called off, with India accusing Pakistan of crossing the red line by playing the Hurriyat card. Then, a meeting between Modi and Sharif at Ufa in Russia in July 2015 produced a ray of hope before ending in a fiasco, with talks between the two national security advisors being called off over whether Sartaj Aziz could meet the Hurriyat leaders or not when he came to Delhi. India was clear there would be no third party in the negotiations with Pakistan and would call off talks if Islamabad disrespected it.

WASHINGTON: Any residual doubts about the intensity of the strategic engagement between India and the United States should dissipate with the meeting next week in Washington DC between the American Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and his Indian counterpart Manohar Parikkar, their third pow-wow in nine months.



The meeting will be book-ended by the US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue in Delhi involving Secretary of State John Kerry and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker (and their Indian counterparts Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman), and the visit to the US of Home Minister Rajnath Singh for the homeland security dialogue later in September.



Prime Minister Modi is also expected to meet President Obama at the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China on September 4-5, for what will possibly be their last meeting as heads of government.


 Prime Minister Modi may be a no-show+.



The flurry of bilateral visits and exchanges will conclude the Modi government's engagement with the Obama administration as the US Presidential election campaign enters the final stretch in America's winter of discontent.



One of the few bright spots in an otherwise bleak world outlook is what both Washington and New Delhi agree has been a constructive and productive engagement between the two countries, and inasmuch as it is expected to continue into the next U.S administration regardless of who heads it, the two sides want to conclude as much business as possible before the impending changes in Washington DC.



Officials familiar with the engagement said the defense minister's visit to the US Capital was advanced in part to conclude unfinished business before the makeover in Washington, which will also see personnel changes at the Indian Embassy.



The long-awaited and intensely-negotiated agreement pertaining to bilateral military logistics cooperation is just one item that is expected to be ticked off in a US-India defense agenda that has gotten more extensive with each passing year.



Customized to India's specific needs, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) is the centerpiece of three foundational agreements that the US sees as the basis of long-term military cooperation - the expression ''alliance'' being anathema to India.


 Scorpene snafu+will likely be the opening that Washington will use to persuade India to move the on two remaining agreements -- Communication Interoperability and Security Memorandum Agreement (CISMOA) and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) although New Delhi has been leery of such arrangements precisely because of the risk of such leaks.



But given the intense military engagement -- the US is now India's #1 defense partner in terms of hardware supplies and operational exercises -- such agreements are inevitable although New Delhi has sought customized versions specific to its unique status as a ''major defense partner,'' albeit as a ''non-ally.''



It is in this spirit that India is testing the frontiers of the American word that just about anything it has is on the table for India -- from the most advanced jet fighters to aircraft carrier technology to drones.



Indeed, the General Atomics-manu,factured Predator Drones are the next item on India's military shopping list in the U.S. that has already ticked off heavy strategic lift aircrafts, anti-submarine warfare aircraft, and Harpoon Missiles, among other items.



Parikkar was initially scheduled to head out to the west coast to visit some of US manufacturing facilities but it now appears he will stay in the Washington DC area and perhaps visit local affiliates.



The US-India engagement comes even as there is a sharp decline in Washington's patronage of Pakistan, now seen as a terrorist state in all but formal designation.



Pakistan's attempt to impute an Indian hand in its domestic turmoil, including in Balochistan and Karachi, has had no perceptible impact in Washington (or at the UN in New York), aside from the standard salutary advise to both sides that they should keep talking, with the pace, scope, and character of the dialogue to be decided by them.


 Pakistan continues to host terror groups+and has not given up its policy of using them as proxies in the neighborhood, despite protestations to the contrary, has not gone unnoticed in Washington, particularly after the latest attack on the American University in Kabul, which the Afghan government has blamed squarely on Pakistan.

It all began when Swati blamed Abhijeet for giving a Chennai-based techie's murder a 'communal tangent'. Abhijeet had shared news of the murder in question, calling it an action borne out of 'love jihad' for no reason.

NEW DELHI: Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday slammed Pakistan and separatist leaders for fuelling unrest in Jammu and Kashmir and hoped that a ""very concerned"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi would get the troubled state out of the deadly turmoil that has left over 70 dead and crippled life in the valley for 50 days.



Mehbooba met Modi at his 7, Race Course residence during which the two discussed the Kashmir situation as well as ways out of the ongoing unrest.



The violence has caused a ""deep pain"" to the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister told reporters outside Modi's residence.



""The Prime Minister is very concerned and is as hurt as we are with the deaths in Kashmir,"" she said.



She directly blamed Pakistan for inciting the violence and said Kashmiri youth were attacking security forces and police stations after being provoked to do so.



""I want to tell Pakistan, if it has any sympathy for Kashmiris, it should stop provoking them to attack police stations — and save youth from being killed.""



This is the first time that Mehbooba, previously known for her soft corner for Pakistan and separatists when in opposition, has directly blamed Islamabad for the Kashmir trouble.



The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader said Pakistan lost a ""golden chance"" to resolve the Kashmir problem when Modi went to Lahore in December last and later home minister Rajnath Singh early this month visited Islamabad for a Saarc conference.



""It is time for Pakistan to respond (to India) if it wants peace in Kashmir,"" she said.



The meeting was her first with Modi since the unrest began after the July 8 killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani.



The death of the 22-year-old social media savvy militant, largely blamed for reviving separatist sentiments in the valley, triggered a wave of stone-pelting protests. Over 11,000 persons — including 7,000 civilians and 4,000 security personnel — have been injured in the deadliest unrest the valley has seen in six years.



Mehbooba favoured talks ""with all stakeholders"" to solve the Kashmir issue but asked separatist leaders to shun violence.



""They (the separatists) have to decide if they want to talk. On one side, you tell youth to attack security forces and army camps... Talks should be held with those who want peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue. For others, it is a business. Those who provoke people and cause bloodshed don't want talks.""



She rejected a separatist notion that the United Nations can solve the Kashmir problem.



The PDP leader reminded separatist leaders how Pakistan's former military dictator Pervez Musharraf had said the dispute would be solved by taking into consideration the aspirations of the people of India, Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir.



When not in office, Mehbooba and her PDP were vocal about Musharraf's four-point formula for Kashmir. That included no change in borders, phased demilitarisation, self-governance and joint supervision by Islamabad and New Delhi for both sides of the state divided between India and Pakistan. The PDP's much touted self-rule formula is in line with the Musharraf plan floated in 2006.



The chief minister said the ""Indian democracy has enough space to accommodate dreams of Kashmiris"".



""If Modi wants, and he of course wants, the Kashmir issue will be solved... Modi ji has a majority and if during his time, the situation doesn't change then it will never change. I have high hopes from the Prime Minister.""



She made a passionate appeal to Kashmiri protesters for peace and sought ""one chance"" to get the Kashmir issue solved.



""These are the same youth and kids who would accompany me in my public rallies. Give me a chance I will get it (Kashmir issue) solved. It has not been only two months since I have taken over the government and 'itna bada bawaal aagaya' (such a big problem erupted),"" the first woman J&amp;K; chief minister said, referring to the turmoil.



Her remarks came as protesters on Saturday blocked the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway squatting on the road with the body of a youth who drowned after jumping into the Jhelum river to escape chasing security forces on Friday evening.



The body of Shahnawaz Khan, 24, was retrieved from the river near Sangam village in south Kashmir's Bijbehara area - the home town of Mehbooba Mufti.



The death took the toll to 71 as the unrest continued for the 50th day on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: A day after the Delhi assembly session ended, chief minister ArvindKejriwal— who was in the house on the last day but didn't utter a word — launched a blistering attack on Prime Minister NarendraModi, making wide-ranging allegations and blaming him for his government's troubles. He alleged that he wanted to reverse numerous decisions of the AAP government through the lieutenant-governor, Najeeb Jung, and remove DCW (Delhi Commission for Women) chief Swati Maliwal. He claimed that Maliwal would soon be arrested.



Kejriwal's outburst — first on Twitter and then at a public function at Kirari — came a day after Jung said he was in the process of overturning and rectifying ""illegal decisions"" taken by the AAP government following the August 4 Delhi high court verdict. He accused the LG of ""subverting"" democracy to protect his own ""chair"".



On the CAG audit of expenditure on advertisements by the Delhi government, Kejriwal observed: ""CAG vehemently refuses to audit expenses of the Centre and states. Why? CAG under pressure from BJP?""



""Sources - LG n PMO hell bent on removing Swati Maliwal 4 doing gud job. She'll be arrested coming week n then removed,"" he claimed in a tweet. ""LG hell bent on removing the team which made mohalla clinics and saved money on flyovers,"" he tweeted again. ""Increased min wages in Delhi. Is it illegal? Sources: Big companies met Modiji n opposed it. Now LG sitting on that file,"" he continued. ""If he does not clear the minimum wages file, then the whole of Delhi will go and gherao Modiji and LG,"" said Kejriwal at the public meeting later in the day.



After participating in a foundation stone-laying ceremony for construction of 28km of roads in the Kirari constituency, Kejriwal said: ""We had promised that power rates would be halved. We reduced the rates by way of a subsidy and gave 20,000 litres of water for free. These files too have been called by Modiji and he is threatening that power rates will be increased. I warn you dare not increase the power rates, and if you do so, the people of Delhi will teach you a lesson,"" warned Kejriwal. Sourcess pointed out that it was DERC which had to fix the tariff and it was stuck because the chairman had recused himself.



""Hold power cos accountable, make them pay compensation for unscheduled power cuts. Is it illegal? LG sitting on it. AAP govt asked for land for 10 hospitals from DDA. Modi's LG refused. Was our demand illegal,"" the CM had said in his tweets.



Referring to Jung's statement that he has tried to keep his intervention in the government restricted to the bare minimum, Kejriwal had tweeted: ""If this is 'least interference', then what is 'high interference'? Shameful subversion of democracy to protect chair."" He added: ""Guys. Can u name 1 positive thing that Modiji or his LG did for Delhi so far? Only created hurdles. Negative people.""



He reminded the audience at the rally that when AAP had came to campaign in Kirari, one of the most critical demands was about regularising unauthorised colonies. ""For over 15 years, BJP and Congress promised regularisation before elections. After polls, they would do nothing because they did not have any intention. To ensure that regularisation happens, our government prepared a proposal and sent it to the Centre but Modiji's government is sitting on it. The day the proposal comes back with approval, Delhi government will initiate regularisation within 24 hours,"" claimed the CM. He promised roads, drains and water pipelines in all colonies.



""Last year people of Delhi wiped out the Congress but gave Modiji three seats. Modiji is unable to forget that defeat and is trying to obstruct our work. He got 11 of my MLAs arrested, I stayed quiet. But when they tried to interfere with the developmental work of the government, I had to speak up,"" he said.



He said his government intended to set up 1000 mohalla clinics by December 31 ""but Modiji called LG and told him that these clinics should be stopped from coming up and Najeeb Jung is transferring the team of officers who were working on the clinics"". Kejriwal also claimed that they had built flyovers at a lower cost but ""Modiji called the LG and told him that all the engineers building these flyovers in PWD should be transferred. LG is transferring them. Is this kind of order right?""



He said the BJP-led central government was takingrevengeon the people of Delhi by troubling his government. ""With folded hands I ask the central government to stop its dirty actions. This is against democracy, this is against people,"" he said, warning that otherwise Modi will lose the elections in 2019.

&gt; * Notably, most of these are export-led sectors and job creation in such sectors is dependent on a buoyant global demand, which, incidentally, has been tepid during the period in question.

&gt; * Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there will be no job creation,"" Modi had said.

___

Hyderabad: Telugu megastar Pawan Kalyan has jumped on the bandwagon and called for an all-out fight demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh.



Evoking Telugu pride, the Jana Sena Party founder slammed both centre and state government for not fulfilling the special status promise.



Addressing the mega rally in Tirupati's Indira Maidanam, the 44-year-old said, ""We are not begging or asking for alms. Andhra Pradesh is asking for its rights.""





Lashing out at PM Narendra Modi, Mr Kalyan even advised PM and his party not to use the slogan of cow protection to diver the nation's attention from important issues.



""If you want cow protection, let each of your party worker adopt a cow but don't use cow and cow meat to divert the nation's attention from crucial issues,"" Mr Kalyan said.



Popularly called 'Power Star', Mr Kalyan criticised Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu for taking a soft stance vis-a-vis the centre on the issue.



""All MPs from Andhra Pradesh should stall and paralyse parliament demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh,"" he said.



Mr Kalyan also took on union minister Venkaiah Naidu, pointing out that in 2014, Mr Naidu had promised special status to Andhra Pradesh for 15 years in parliament. But now he says nothing is to be achieved with special status.



The Jana Sena founder said he would launch the campaign for Andhra special status with a public meeting on September 9. He said if nothing was done to meet their demand, the party will launch protest on streets.



However, there is lot of speculation as to why Mr Kalyan chose this time to hold such a mega rally against the central and state government.



Mr Pawan, had in fact, come to Tirupati to call on the family of his fan Vinod Rayal, who was stabbed to death at Kolar in Karnataka three days ago in a brawl with fans of Jr NTR.



Saturday's rally is being seen as a political stepping stone for a more serious role in politics in 2019.



Pawan Kalyan launched his Jana Sena in March, 2014 and backed the BJP-TDP combine. He had even campaigned for them, bringing with him his fans and Kapu votes.

&gt;* On Mother Teresa's birth anniversary, the NDA government must be acknowledged for offering tributes to her from the highest levels.

&gt;* Mother Teresa will be canonised in the Vatican City on 4 September and the government has decided that a representative, of no less a stature than the External Affairs Minister, will lead the Indian delegation to attend the ceremony.

&gt;* RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had sought to convey on 23 February last year that Mother Teresa's service to the poor and the destitute was only a facade behind which she and her organisation carried out religious conversions.

&gt;* Speaking at the inauguration of an orphanage and a women's home in Rajasthan's Bharatpur, Bhagwat said, ""Here we will not provide service like that rendered by Mother Teresa.""

&gt;* While he did show some courtesy by considering the possibility that ""her kind of work was good"", but his real message was the emphasis on whathe called ""a motive behind that service.""

&gt;* Now, a senior Samajwadi Party leader, reportedly from SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav's own family, has proposed a grand alliance (mahagathbandhan) along the lines of the one in Bihar.

422,"Tata DoCoMo case is proof: Modi regime is making foreign investors uneasy

---

&gt;* Every chance he gets, Narendra Modi touts his regime's resolve to make it easier for foreign investors to enter and exit.

&gt;* The deal was based on the understanding that if the Japanese company exited the venture within five years, it would be paid a minimum 50% of the acquisition price.

&gt;* The money was to be raised by either finding a buyer for DoCoMo's 26.5% stake at market value or getting Tata Teleservices to buy the shares at half the original investment value.

&gt;* In 2014, the Tatas offered to buy DoCoMo's stake for Rs 7,250 crore, and sought the RBI's permission to seal the deal.

&gt;* But the finance ministry decided to poke its nose where it didn't belong, and using the Foreign Exchange Management Act as the ruse, denied permission to the deal.

---

&gt;* Listing his regime's achievements from the Red Fort on Independence Day, Narendra Modi claimed that 99% of the money due sugarcane farmers had been paid.

&gt;* Ironically, just two days earlier, Rashtriya Lok Dal's Chaudhary Mushtaq had informed the Uttar Pradesh assembly that sugar mills owed Rs 2116.97 crore to the farmers.

&gt;* According to VM Singh, the convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, the Akhilesh Yadav government has waived off Rs 500 crore in interest payment owed by the mills during 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2014-15.

&gt;* The prime minister's proclamations and the Akhilesh regime's benevolence towards sugar mill owners suggest they are least bothered about the plight of around 50 lakh sugarcane farmers of UP.

&gt;* VM Singh, who has fought several legal battles for sugarcane farmers, said growers across India have been facing an ""acute financial crisis for the past two decades"".

446,"hit the core absolutely. First of all the pessimism is puke inducing. And the rebel without a cause attitude is naïve and stupid. Never understood the hating those in power attitude. Maybe I am different but despite all its ugliness and horrors, I absolutely love politics. It's a thankless job requiring lot of skills and diplomacy especially when you have to satisfy the needs of a lot of stakeholders. Would I want better politicians ? definitely but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy the game and the powerplay of individuals and the sheer talents of people like JJ, Sharad Pawar, Modi, Mamata, SG. I loath and respect these people equally. 

Also most here claim to be atheist or agnostic but will immediately fall on their knees to kiss ass and do hero worshipping especially if it is someone phoren or with phoren degree. 


The funniest irony of sub is freedom of speech, sure many pound about it but are not tolerant of any viewpoints other than their own. Also most lack realism or pragmatism.  I only come here because sometimes there are good topics on discussion and its a good aggregator relating to news about India. 

Also not this sub but generally people think freedom of speech means freedom from criticism or reaction to that speech. You can practice your freedom of speech, but expect people to react to it by shunning you and maligning too, that's all part and parcel of it. 

also the whole black and white or with us-against us attitude is cringe worthy.  

Everyone here wants changes and things to happen fast, without resistance and the fruits of it to be fed with a silver spoon. Change takes time, effort and requires facing huge odds. Change is never comfortable or painless. It is a chaotic process.  

Also everyone wants a leader who will implement **their** views and policies. Politics and democracy is about compromise, you pick a person closest to your ideals with the acceptance that when it comes to governing, compromise is the way forward. you give up a few demands and ideas now to implement the few acceptable ones.

WASHINGTON: Bullish on expanding economic ties with India, the US on Sunday said bilateral trade has reached $109 billion and it will get a further boost from new reforms includin GST+even as it flagged persisting concerns American firms have on issues related to business climate in the fast-growing economy.



US commerce secretary Penny Pritzker, who will be on a 3-day India visit from Monday, also said that travel and tourism and sub-national engagement have been identified as two new areas of focus to drive commercial cooperation between the two countries in 2017, under which the focus would shift from India and the US to Chennai and Charleston.


 Obama Administration+in the past seven-and-a-half years has made significant progress toward realising the potential of what could be one of the largest commercial relationships in the world.



""Our two countries enjoy a thriving trade and investment relationship. US-India bilateral trade reached $109 billion in 2015, up from $37 billion in 2005.



""US and Indian companies are also investing in each other's economies at record levels. In 2015, US investment in India reached more than $28 billion and Indian investment in the United States reached more than $11 billion. In fact, US affiliates of Indian-owned firms now employ more than 52,000 workers in the US,"" Pritzker said.



She exuded confidence that ""India's rapidly growing economy and the Modi government's ambitious reform agenda, including the landmark Goods and Services Tax, passage of the recent national bankruptcy law, and liberalised foreign direct investment limits in key sectors, point toward a deeper economic relationship in the years ahead.""



Asserting that there is a tremendous potential for the US and India to achieve even more together, the Secretary said she is particularly excited over two new areas of focus that will drive their cooperation in the coming year - travel and tourism, and subnational engagement.



She described increasing the number of travelers who move between the US and India as a significant commercial opportunity. More than 1 million people travel between the two countries each year.



""While that figure is strong, there is certainly potential for growth,"" she added.



On sub-national engagement, Pritzker said: ""Both US and Indian states play a vital role in driving economic growth and setting business climate policy. Companies choose to invest in Charleston, South Carolina or Chennai just as much as they select the US and India.""

466,"Govt plans Rs 2000 crore package for people displaced from PoK

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitching for the rights of those living in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan regions of Pakistan, the government has proposed a Rs 2,000-crore package for people displaced from PoK living in India.The home ministry is expected to place the details of the package before the Cabinet for approval soon, senior ministry officials said.It is learnt that J&amp;K government has identified 36,348 such families which will get around Rs 5.5 lakh each.

&gt;* Refugees from Pakistan, mostly from PoK, were settled in different parts of Jammu, Kathua and Rajouri districts over a period of time.

&gt;* The displaced people can cast their votes in Lok Sabha polls but not in the elections to the Jammu &amp; Kashmir assembly.Jammu and Kashmir Sharanarthi Action Committee (JKSAC), an organisation representing the displaced people of PoK, has maintained that the package should not be seen as final settlement as Rs 9,200 crore was required to settle all of them.The NDA government had in January 2015 approved certain concessions for refugees from Pakistan settled in J&amp;K after considering their problems.

&gt;* These includes special recruitment drives for induction into paramilitary forces, equal employment opportunities in the state and admission for children of refugees in Kendriya Vidyalayas.Modi had for the first time talked about the plight of people of PoK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Balochistan at an all-party meeting convened to discuss the J&amp;K situation on August 12.

&gt;* There have been reports that the government is planning to invite the diaspora from PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan for the next Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas to be held in Bengaluru.

467,"I think on the garb of rising legitimate questions and making rational points you really are making delusion of yourself. Or are you trying too hard to be looked different?! Look, India's move was a purely strategic one. Till then India wasn't raising the question of Pakistan sovereignty over Baluchistan or whatever apart from its more pressing issues like terrorism, heck India didn't even issue asylum to Baluchistan's legit 'renegades' and even in the inside the power corridors of India it has already come to the point that we'd be happy with status quo of LoC as the international border. But Pakistan's ceaseless sabre rattling and catfishing for browny points which almost come to a fault has gone too far now. Despite knowing it is unrealistic to even hope for getting Kashmir back into their fold with the changing international geopolitical landscape, and ever widening chasm between us day by day in every conceivable indices. Dedicating it's independence for Kashmir freedom, drumming up Burhan Wani as freedom fighter, discussing India's domestic in their parliament and put into motion, their embassy celebrating current situation in the valley -all these fly directly against very idea of India's sovereignty. I mean they are trying hard to make us look like a Hindu country where Muslims are having a hard time, and with that line of argument they imagine Kashmir should be independent because it has Muslims. Simple logic for their ears. So basically the 'secular' that is enshrined in the very preamble of our Constitution is being challenged. Actually, India doesn't care whether Baluchistan got independence or not; it's just a means to bleed Pakistan internally so it pays it due, and letting them learn never to indulge in something which they shouldn't at the first place. Baluchistan issues because of India finding a place in the front page of their daily paper, and starting internal deliberations in their political/military circle itself is an achievement. Because of Modi. So long story short, we had to make a move. We made the move. Think like it's purely strategic like anything when it comes to international politics. The bus has already moved. And that move should be a wake up call for Pakistan's own follies. Else history is unforgivable at times for those who doesn't learn.",2016-08-29 06:11:56

___

New Delhi: Sports Minister Vijay Goel's Rio visit with Indian Olympians has been more than just eventful. From misspelling names to confusing athletes to almost getting his accreditation cancelled for alleged rude behaviour', Mr Goel has had a no-holds-barred battle with his critics.  
  
  



Show Full Article

 
But while the Olympics may be over, the minister's Rio gaffes are not. And the trolling continues.

 
 

 
In what Mr Goel later explained as a ""slip of tongue"", he briefed the media on Sunday after PM Modi's meeting with ""Rio gold medallists PV Sindhu and Sakshi Malik"".

 
 

 
""PM Modi today met with Khel Ratna, Dhyaanchand and Dronacharya awardees. The sportspersons also included our two Rio gold medalists PV Sindhu and Sakshi Malik,"" Mr Goel was heard saying on camera.



 
The clip was spread like wildfire on Twitter -- accompanied by jokes and comments.

&gt;[-Nick Turrim (@mhanthung)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/welcometocomedynightswithvijaygoel?src=hash)

 
This adds to Mr Goel's most-trolled list of gaffes. Earlier, he had wished good luck to track athlete Srabani Nanda, but posted a picture of Duttee Chand to go with it; he also misspelled Dipa Karmakar as ""Dipa Karmanakar"" on Twitter.



 
  In his defence, Mr Goel said, ""People shouldn't make an issue out of a slip of tongue, this can happen at times. I wanted to say medallist but ended up saying gold medallist and anyway, who knows we might bag a gold medal in the coming years.""

 
 

 
Sarah Peterson, the Continental Manager for Rio 2016 Organising Committee, in a letter to Indian Chef-de-Mission Rakesh Gupta had threatened to cancel Mr Goel's accreditation on grounds of misbehaviour and trying to enter venues with his entourage who did not  have valid passes.

 
 

 
Rejecting the allegations, Mr Goel had said, ""They should have told things orally, we are not informed anything and they wrote straight away to Chef-de-Mission. Language is also a main problem here, maybe there is a misunderstanding because of that.""

473,"#ONGC Videsh Ltd to stay put in South China Sea for strategic reasons

___

**Highlights**

1. ONGC will stay put in South China Sea for exploration off the coast of Vietnam

1. Beijing has in the past repeatedly warned against exploration activities in the region

1. Vietnam in the recent past has emerged as the fulcrum of India's 'Act East' policy

NEW DELHI: Despite not having found any hydrocarbon, India's ONGC Videsh Limited (ONGC) will stay put in South China Sea for exploration off the coast of Vietnam. The Vietnam government has given another extension to OVL for exploration in deep sea Block 128, which is located in contested waters, allowing India to maintain its presence there purely for strategic reasons.



Beijing has in the past repeatedly warned against exploration activities in the region and has asked India to instead consider a ``joint development'' with China.



This is the fourth extension to OVL for exploration in Block 128 and will expire on June 27 next year, official sources here said. OVL had earlier given up another block allotted by Vietnam for exploration and would have done the same with Block 128 had it not been for pressure from MEA to remain there.



As expected perhaps, India had earlier this year sought an extension for OVL to retain its presence in South China Sea. China itself has shown no regard for the disputed status of Gilgit-Baltistan in Jammu and Kashmir in carrying out its commercial and military activities, which are related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, in the region which India considers its own.



Vietnam in the recent past has fast emerged as the fulcrum of India's Act East Policy which has seen the government attempting to upgrade its defence and security partnerships with countries in the region. From extending a $ 100 million line of credit to Vietnam for purchase of patrol boats to signing a joint vision statement on defence cooperation last year, India has sought to make Vietnam the focal point of its reinvigorated outreach to the east aimed not just at Asean but the wider Asia-Pacific.



PM Narendra Modi will visit Hanoi next month, on his way to China for the G 20 summit, for what will be only the third visit by an Indian prime minister to the country in the past few decades. The two others who visited Vietnam in recent times are A B Vajpayee in 2001 and Manmohan Singh in 2010.



After suggesting a shift in India's position on South China Sea under Modi, which saw India name-checking the dispute in its joint documents with both US and Japan, the government seemed to have diluted its position again in the run up to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) plenary meeting. However, with China not relenting in its opposition to India's bid for NSG membership, India may have to again review its position on South China Sea.



India and Vietnam recently discussed the conflicts in South China Sea and Beijing's refusal to even acknowledge the ruling by an international tribunal which dismissed China's claim that its 9-dash line, which covered almost 90 per cent of South China Sea waters, was based on its historically exercised exclusive control over the same.



While they did not name China, the 2 countries said in a press release, ""Both sides also discussed recent developments in the maritime domain and the need for peaceful resolution of all disputes in accordance with accepted principles of international law as reflected notably in the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982.""

There are so many taxes that even after buying it for 10 and selling it for 100 , I wouldn't have been able to make a profit. Rather i would have been in a loss. 
Guess how much is the export tax in China for most of the goods?0% and they ask why is China ahead of us. This noob Modi is introducing more taxes. What would any one who wants(and can afford) to do business would do? They would move out of this shit hole",2016-08-29 16:13:00

&gt;* ""What real changes have you felt in your lives (not via media reports), ever since the Modi government came to power,"" was the question to which Pushpak replied, narrating a story about how the officer posted in Tripura got a call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 10 pm on July 21 asking for his help to repair National Highway 208.

&gt;* Modi apologised to him again for calling so late and said that he is just done with a meeting with Mr Nitin Gadkari and they needed his help to repair National Highway 208-A connecting Tripura to the rest of the country.

497,"India’s major defence partner tag deepens ties with US: Carter

---

&gt;* And a very substantial advance over just a few months ago, Mr. Carter told Pentagon reporters at a news conference along with Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.

&gt;* In June when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited U.S. and met President Barack Obama, the country had designated India as a major defence partner

&gt;* The Indian government sent us before our meeting today a very lengthy, detailed and we thought very constructive paper about how to implement the major defence partnership understanding.

&gt;* It will facilitate defence, trade and technology sharing with India on a level we reserve only for our closest friends and allies, and it will support both of what I have called the two important handshakes between our countries and our two militaries, he said.

&gt;* We agreed to advance a number of collaborative projects, on jet engine technology, chemical and biological protection, aircraft carriers and other systems; all by the end of the year.
