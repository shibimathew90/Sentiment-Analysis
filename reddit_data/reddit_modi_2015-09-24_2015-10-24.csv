---

&gt;* Varanasi, Sept.23 (ANI): Varanasi Police on Wednesday baton charged the pilgrims when they were trying to immerse Ganesha idols in the river Ganga.

&gt;* Earlier in 2013, the Allahabad High Court had ordered a complete ban on immersion of idols in Ganga and Yamuna to keep a check on the increasing pollution in the rivers.

&gt;* In the past three years, the High Court several times ordered a ban on immersion of idols in Ganga.

&gt;* However, it had relaxed the norms on the insistence of district authorities as changes in immersion routes could lead to law and order unrest.

---

&gt;* ""Rahul needed a foreign vacation after holding two rallies and thinking hard about farmers,"" said the BJP's Sambit Patra and added in another jibe, ""Gandhi has been sent for a forceful vacation as Nitish and Lalu were not comfortable with his presence in Bihar.

&gt;* ""Over the weekend, both Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar had skipped Rahul Gandhi's first rally in Bihar , where their three parties have partnered to take on the BJP in assembly elections which will be held in five phases from next month.

&gt;* Rahul Gandhi is visiting Aspen in the US to attend a conference called ""Weekend with Charlies Rose"", where thought leaders from politics, medicine, defence and other fields will gather, the Congress has said, emphasising that Mr Gandhi's is a ""short, personal visit and he will return shortly.

&gt;* ""Earlier this year, Mr Gandhi's visit abroad was extended several times and stretched to almost two months during a crucial Parliament session, leading to political speculation that he had gone on protest leave after not being made the party president.That time the Congress had not shared where Mr Gandhi was.

&gt;* This time the party said it had ""no hesitation"" in giving details of the conference he is attending.Mr Gandhi's visit to the US coincides with the official six-day trip to that country of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will attend the UN General Assembly session in New York before heading to the Silicon Valley where he will visit the Facebook headquarters for a townhall.A party functionary, who didn't wish to be named has told NDTV that Rahul Gandhi has no public engagement in the US.

---

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi today presented to his Irish counterpart reproductions of a selection of historic manuscripts and papers pertaining to two pre-independence era Irish officials, Thomas Oldham and George Abraham Grierson, in recognition of their contributions in India.Mr Modi also gifted his Irish counterpart Enda Kenny a specially handcrafted piece of silver, marble and roughly-hewn sandstone rock that imagines the Irish symbol of shamrock as a votive candle-stand or an 'aarti' lamp, with a peacock perched by the side of shamrock leaves, along with silver-tipped crystal dewdrops signifying serenity and purity.The original manuscripts and papers which Mr Modi presented to Mr Kenny are preserved in the National Archives of India.Born in Dublin, Oldham (1816-1878) was appointed as geological surveyor in 1850 to conduct a survey in India and his services were placed with the then Government of Bengal.He assumed charge in March 1851 and his joining day is celebrated as the foundation day of the Geological Survey of India.

&gt;* Apart from conducting the first systematic coal mapping of India - and later initiating mapping of other minerals - he wrote extensively on the fossils of India.George A Grierson (1851-1941) was an Irish civil servant and philologist who, starting 1898, conducted the first Linguistic Survey of India.

&gt;* The Survey was later published over several years during 1903-28.It was Grierson's Survey that provided the first scientifically-based taxonomy of the Indo-Aryan languages within which the linguistic status of various forms of Hindi, Urdu and other Indo-Aryan speech forms is based.The separation of Hindi into Western and Eastern dialect zones is the direct result of Grierson's classification efforts.

&gt;* As a student of mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin, Grierson took prizes in Sanskrit and Hindi.He went to Bengal in October 1873, where, in addition to carrying out his duties in a succession of government posts until 1898, he devoted much time to language research.

&gt;* Two of his most important works are Seven Grammars of the Dialects and Sub-dialects of the Bihari Language (1883-87) and Bihar Peasant Life (1885).The latter work, in addition to offering much linguistic information, describes the life, farming methods, and beliefs of the Bihar peasantry.In 1994, India instituted an award in his honour that is given to foreign scholars who have made significant contributions to Hindi.

that was the situation modi was in 2002.. no matter what he did, people were going to die, because people were killing people.. the only thing modi could do was to try his best to minimize the number of people who die.. and according to the court rulings, that's exactly what he did.. he may not have been able to take the best option, but you can't call it an intentional murders because option 1 and option 2 are not all that black and white..

whichever party is in power, doesn't have control over law and order issues at the minute-est level. These cases that are recently showing up in media are unfortunate and do not indicate ineptitude at the highest level in the central government of India.

here's the technical reply for pseudo-intellectuals like you.

Law and Order is a state subject. Dehradun is in Uttarakhand, its a state subject, led by the Congress party.

the kannada writer who was killed, an unfortunate killing was also another congressi state.

Stop blaming modi for all issues, including those not under his jurisdiction.

Ever heard of Maya Kodnani? She is a convicted rioter sentenced to 28 years in jail for her role in the riots. She was in constant touch with Modi during the two days of the riots. Later she was made a minister by him.

Heard of Babu Bajrangi? According to him the rioters had a free hand for two days. During which the police were ordered to hold back by Modi himself.

Both these criminals are currently out on bail for some flimsy reasons. Jai Hind. Jai Modi. 

And the person responsible for puting away these criminals, Teesta Setalvad, is being hounded by the Modi government on fabricated charges. Thankfully the judiciary in India is not totally corrupt, so she is not yet in jail. That is despite hordes of Gujarat police and CBI officers being sent by Modi to harass her. The Gujarat model in action. Jail or kill your opposition.

&gt; * To connect all the dots relating to his disappearance, he said his family would appeal to PM Modi to write to the heads of the countries of Russia, Japan, China, America, UK, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia to declassify all Netaji files lying with them.

&gt; * Sources noted that Mr Owaisis meeting with the Prime Minister holds immense political significance, given that the AIMIM announced earlier this week that it will put up Assembly poll candidates in Bihars Kishanganj, Katihar, Araria and Purnea districts (known as Seemanchal), where the BJP has traditionally been on a weak wicket.

&gt; * Ever since Mr Owaisi announced his partys intention of contesting the polls from this region, the JD(U)-RJD alliance has been claiming that he is doing so at the behest of the BJP, as it might critically divide Muslim votes.

&gt; * Prabhu had been handpicked by Modi to take charge of the railways.Misra's note referred to the slow progress of projects such as station development and high-speed services.Both are futuristic projects and should be implemented with better planning and implementation, he had said.He also questioned low budgetary spending in the April-June quarter, which reflected poorly on the railways when set against the record of other departments such as Nitin Gadkari's roads ministry and the overall record of the government.The PMO spokesman asserted this doesn't amount to any dissatisfaction with the way things are being run at the ministry.

&gt; * ""The PMO is totally and fully satisfied with the railway ministry,"" Jagdish Thakkar, public relations officer at the PMO, said in an email to ET.Railway ministry officials declined to comment on record.

&gt; * Congress Vice-President has directed Congress leaders, including Youth Congress activists, to educate and inform the public about the Congress' stand on to counter the ""misinformation"" being spread by the Democratic Alliance government.

&gt; * The party is hopeful that by adopting a strategy, similar to that of the land Bill, it would succeed in compelling the government to accede to its demands if the government wanted to get the constitutional amendment passed in Parliament.

&gt; * Amrinder Singh Raja Brar, the Youth Congress president, said, ""The Congress has concerns on certain issues - a cap of 18 per cent on the GST rate, a dispute redressal authority and scrapping of the one per cent additional tax.

Yes, Indian Americans want to help India but most don't know a lot about the policies these parties have regarding relations to India (applies especially to 1st gen Americans and Immigrants who have been living here for more than 10 yrs). The average amount Indian Americans know is that Modi is the new PM and that India and Pakistan don't like each other. It also doesn't help that the media (including reddit except for this sub) only focuses on the issues of healthcare (which is a really big fucking issue that affect all Indians here), military, foreign policy (in relation to the middle east), and immigration (in relation to mexico/hispanics). To top it off, immigration as a whole is closer to the bottom of the priority list for a lot immigrants and 1st gens (except for Hispanics and Whites) because they are already here. I’m sure this is different for new Indian immigrants, but they make up a small portion of Indian Americans, and the number of these people who really pay attention to politics and dig into political issues further than what is shown on the news is even fewer. As a 1st gen Indian American, I didn’t know shit about India until about two years ago when I really did some in depth research and still continue to do so because I’m Indian and I love learning about politics, history, and military. All my ethnically Indian friends who are 1st and 2nd gen know even less.

I live in one of the wealthiest zip codes in the South East and went to one of the best high schools in the SE, and I can tell you that my HS has suffered financial short-backs resulting in drastically cutting back on some extracurricular programs and firing some really great teachers. Although most of the funding does come from the state, an increase in education funding from the federal gov. would surely help.

---

&gt; * BENGALURU: India's globally acclaimed Mars mission completed one year today with Indian Space Research Organisation releasing the Mars Atlas to mark the feat of the Orbiter whose life is now expected to last many more years.It contains a compilation of images acquired by Mars Colour Camera (MCC) and results obtained by other payload in a form of scientific atlas.ISRO will also be bringing out a book, 'Fishing hamlet to Mars' on November 5 to mark the anniversary of Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), whose success has boosted India's global standing as a space power.It was on this day last year that India scripted space history when it successfully placed its low-cost Mars spacecraft in orbit around the Red Planet on its very first attempt, breaking into an elite club of three nations.The space probe entered the Mars orbit on September 24, almost a year after its launch, and made its home around the Red Planet.

&gt; * European Space Agency (ESA) of European consortium, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the US and Roscosmos of Russia are the only three other agencies which had so far sent their missions to Mars.Only 21 of the total of 51 missions sent to Mars by various countries have been successful before MOM.The Mars mission of the ISRO is aimed at establishing the country's capability to reach the red planet and focus on looking for the presence of methane, an indicator of life in Mars.The make-or-break tricky manoeuvre was carried out on this very date last year, with clockwork precision on the refrigerator sized spacecraft as planned in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who exultantly described it as ""a historic occasion"", saying the country has achieved the ""near impossible"".The life of the Mars Orbiter Spacecraft which now ISRO says can last ""many years"" was earlier intended for only six months, and later extended for another six months in March this year.

&gt; * ""Mars (mission) is expected to last for many years now, because it has gone through solar conjunction also; so we don't see much of a problem,"" ISRO Chairman AS Kiran Kumar had said here on Monday.

&gt; * Then we were not expecting so much fuel to remain after we completed our insertion activity,"" he said.According to Kumar, about 35 kg of fuel was still left and ""all other subsystems are working fine and so far we have not had any failures"".Releasing the Atlas, Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO said Mars Orbiter spacecraft marks one year of its life around the red planet today.After successfully completing one year of the mission life around Mars, now a large data set has been acquired by all five payloads of MOM, it said.The Space Applications Centre, (ISRO), Ahmedabad, has brought out the Mars Atlas which contains a compilation of images acquired by Mars Colour Camera (MCC) and results obtained by other payload results, the space agency said.The images from MCC have provided unique information about Mars at varying spatial resolutions.Former Chairman of ISRO Dr K Radhakrishnan, during whose tenure the mission was accomplished, has listed out the five contributing factors for the success of MOM.He said learning from others' failures, the team's preparedness for contingencies, rigorous execution, thorough feasibility study leading to a robust mission planning, and resolve to contribute might for national pride- have contributed for the success.The Rs 450-crore Mangalyaan is the cheapest inter-planetary mission that, at just USD 74 million, costs less than the estimated USD 100 million budget of the sci-fi blockbuster ""Gravity"" and a tenth of NASA's Mars mission Maven that entered the Martian orbit couple of days before MOM.ISRO had launched the Mars Orbiter Mission's spacecraft on its nine-month long odyssey on a homegrown PSLV rocket from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on November 5, 2013, and it had escaped the earth's gravitational field on December 1, 2013.India became the first country in the world to have successfully launched its mission to the Red Planet in the very first attempt.Mars Orbiter has five scientific instruments - Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP), Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM), Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA), Mars Colour Camera (MCC) and Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS).After India's much-hailed missions to the Moon and Mars that boosted ISRO's global standing in space technology, the next inter-planetary expedition to be launched is under discussion, ISRO Chairman has said.

&gt;* Such is the stature of your position, that the influential NRI Patel community, which was embroiled in a quota war back home, withdrew its protests.

&gt;* Even as you globetrot, seize deals like a conqueror and bring back FDI, increasingly, one of the permanent fixtures of your travels abroad has been criticising the 'seculars' of this country.

&gt;* At the same time, yoga, vedic camps, havans, the Gayatri mantra, shanti path recitations and reading about the lives of great men were part of the curriculum.

&gt;* Don't worry Mr Prime Minister, there are enough mechanisms and individuals who are trying to ensure that the great language of Sanskrit is not lost.

&gt;* I would like to end the letter with this shloka that I was taught as a part of my school prayer, long before you came to power, in the hope that good sense prevails over all of us in happy and difficult times, in our own country and when we travel abroad.

&gt;* When Bose referred to him as undemocratic, he angrily retorted: The lion becomes a king by birth, not by an election in the jungle. Rajmohan comments that the ungracious remark was also, in the light of Subhass subsequent courage, inapt, but entirely understandable in the context of Congresss internal struggle of 1939.

&gt;* Years later, in 1946, Patel made partial amends for these cruel remarks by assisting the personnel of the Indian National Army when they returned to their homeland.

&gt;* He repeatedly called them reactionary, the mirror image of Islamic fundamentalism, playing into the Rajs hands by undermining the Hindu-Muslim unity sought to be fostered by Gandhi and by Bose himself.

&gt;* Bose writes that the Hindu Mahasabha, like its Moslem counterpart, consisted not only of erstwhile Nationalists, but also of a large number of men who were afraid of participating in a political movement and wanted a safer platform for themselves.

&gt;* Not on a suit or in a visitors' book but on the national flag.

&gt;* Somehow Prime Minister Narendra Modi'sname always becomes the focus when it comes to meeting the United States President Barack Obama.

&gt;* Last time, it was a controversy about an expensive suit embroidered with strings of his name, on other occasions it has become a story about who exactly signs his name on various visitors books on his behalf.

&gt;* This time, the controversy had to do with the the national flag that he apparently autographed as a gift and souvenir for Obama.While visiting the United States for a two-day trip, Modi apparently signed the flag on Thursday which was meant to be presented to President Obama through Michelin Star chef Vikas Khanna who was vested with the responsibility of showcasing the best of Indian cuisineduring the prime minister's meeting with 40 top executives from the US.The very fact that the flag had allegedly been signed on made many on social media quickly spring to action and point out that Modis act violated section V of the Indian Flag Code which specifies that lettering of any kind shall not be put upon the flag.And, of course, everyone had something to say and views to tweet.

&gt;* Here's a selection.On the World Yoga Day celebrations in June earlier this year, a similar controversy had briefly erupted when Modi was allegedly seen wiping his face with the national flag.Even as trolling and jibes continued through Friday on what was seen as a non-issue by many, some actually made the point that this could be an opportune moment to amend the codes laid down for national symbols to make them more liberal and grounded in reality.

Thats what I thought of my gen until we all grew up and the bullshit intensified.

&gt; although, I do not understand their blind faith in someone like Modi, on the basis of religion.

Maybe you were too young to have experienced the blind faith for Gandhis since 1947. Nehru, then Indira got elected even after she declared emergency (albeit she was defeated in the following election cycle), then Rajiv because his mom died even after the Sikh massacre. Blind faith for generations based on religion for Mulayam, Laloo, Thackaray, Farooq, etc. There is a case to be made against vote bank politics and the BJP, Congress, SP, BSP have all leveraged that and will continue to leverage it.

&gt; * Rahul Gandhi's photos adorn the shoulders of mainstream newspapers but he is in Aspen, Colorado, apparently to attend a conference.

&gt; * That is the perception.If he has chosen to disappear from the scene to keep his self respect, well, this would be the first time he has demonstrated a diminishing value called sensitivity, a thin skin.The Aspen conference, if there is one, may not be his only engagement.

&gt; * There he is on front pages, his escapades, if not his politics, the subject of heated debate on prime time TV.The media's obsession with Rahul is clearly not because of some intrinsic worth it sees in him.

161,"Reading highlighted parts from a book without reading the whole text context is cherry picking. 

Let's clear out few things.  
1. The quoted text you have provided was a counter to my historical arguments I think.  But there are so many other texts that reaffirm my views ( I am not a student of history) example that AMA on caste issues was exactly the scientific study u am talking about. 

2.i support reservations.  I agree with you are saying that it's based on  social backwardness not economics.  What I am trying to say is by equalizing economic field social backwardness will also decrease.  How can I say this??  Because through reservations we now have a OBC middle class that's involved in mainstream business.  Our discriminations doesn't stem from ethnicity. Class structure existed in almost all the societies. A serf was suppressed by the nobility.  Same case is here.  You can find out arguments that serf belong to a particular race but in India with all its mixing the race factor is now where in question. 

3. Your original question about do we need more laws. My answer is still the same.  If you look at data and count the number of politicians belonging to the discriminated societies you see a steady rise in it.  Modi a OBC is the PM of this country. 

4. Equating race = dalit = black is what evangelicals are doing to create a new ethnicity.  For some reasons all the ST get categorised into dalits.  India is a big country with a very diverse with very diverse discrimination s, you can't clump them together for a political entity that's converted and wants a new nation.  Such attempts to Balkanize is deplorable.  By feeding young dalits that they were suppressed for 10k years is historically wrong. 

5. How do we solve this discrimination problem.?? 
Mainstreaming is already happening. We need reservations on basis of economic conditions. With mixing of rural -  urban population the old set job descriptions are changing.  Today a business man can also be a Brahman and a scientist OBC. 

It will take time but it will happen.  Like society equality happened in the West.  ",2015-09-25 20:10:07

172,"I have. BJP actually has little clout in the media compared to their major rivals.

http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/et-commentary/why-the-media-seems-to-hate-the-modi-government/

&gt;The reality is that a large number of media houses are owned by politicians/people close of politicians. For example, NDTV is owned in part by close relatives of Congress MP Navin Jindal as well as by the sister of the CPI(M) MP Brinda Karat. News X, India News and Sunday Guardian are owned in part by the son of former Congress leader Venod Sharma as well as by relatives of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda of the Congress. These facts are not very well known, though Newslaundry has put out a very interesting piece which highlights exactly this point. Further, it seems as if the Congress is much better entrenched in the media than the BJP, though the latter holds some sway with Hindi news channels.

&gt;Is it unthinkable that the ownership pattern of a news channel/ newspaper influences the narrative promoted by that channel/paper and substantially shapes its portrayal of the government’s work? Given that Congress leaders &amp; their relatives own far more channels/newspapers, I don’t find it surprising that the mainstream media tends to favour the Congress over the BJP.

The article goes on to point out that the BJP under Modi is actively hostile towards the media and does not try to cultivate relationships with journalists, editors and owners like other parties. Even AAP does a better job at media management, seeing how they have been giving journos special access to their ministers/MLAs and spending 526 crores on advertising.",2015-09-25 23:03:09

&gt;* To meet the Indian Air Forces requirements, the possibilities being explored by New Delhi include going in for large-scale manufacturing of the locally-produced light combat aircraft or building a fighter with foreign collaboration in India.

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: As the highway sector shows signs of revival and private investment interest in projects on PPP mode gathers pace, the Narendra Modi government is confident of achieving the target of building 30 km per day.

&gt;* Road transport and highways ministry officials said that by April, the construction would be 17-18 km per day and will be more during the next fiscal year.

&gt;* Investor interest in the roads and highways sector has grown in recent months after the government resolved four major issues responsible for stalled projects or slow progress.

&gt;* We hope to maintain this pace and people are now taking the compensation since there is clarity on the applicability of new Land Acquisition Act,"" said an NHAI official.

&gt;* While highways minister Nitin Gadkari had told TOI earlier this week that his focus is on monitoring and resolving issues on the ground, which will accelerate the pace of construction, officials said that maintaining the speed of awarding projects for the next two-three years will translate into achieving the 30 km per day target.

&gt; * India has a long history of relations with the Middle East, more than any of todays existing or emerging great powers.

&gt; * Several factors make the Middle East, particularly the Gulf, more strategically important for India.

&gt; * For this reason, Modis visit elevated the UAE relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including the establishment of a Strategic Security Dialogue and engagement between their respective national security advisors and national security councils.

&gt; * In pursuing an intensified strategic partnership with the UAE and the Gulf, India has two key advantages over other great powers, which Modi emphasized in his visit.

&gt;* ""When we speak of climate justice, we demonstrate our sensitivity and resolve to secure the future of the poor from the perils of natural disasters.

&gt;* ""Climate justice, he indicated, is a ""question on equity"", its central principle is common but the responsibility is ""differentiated"".India has always maintained that the responsibility of containing climate change - the fallout of a medley of causes including carbon-dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases - is of the developed world and not of the developing countries.Indicating that developed countries need to change, PM Modi said to address climate change, people not only need to generate clean energy, but also effect a change in lifestyle that makes people ""less dependent on energy"".Talking to the media later, external affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said India's per capita emission is 1.7, America's is 16 or 17.

&gt;* ""In the UN climate package passed in Doha in 2012, a commitment was made to scale up funding to help developing countries deal with global warming and convert to planet-friendlier energy sources by 2020.

&gt;* ""International partnership must be at the centre of our efforts... and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the bedrock of our collective enterprise.""

&gt; * Currently on his six-day long visit to the United States, Modi is keen to push his Digital India initiatives among the top executives of Silicon Valley before meeting US President Barack Obama.While there is a lot of buzz and excitement in the Indian media's coverage of Modi's US visit, the American media seems almost indifferent to the presence of the Indian prime minister on American soil.

&gt; * Or so it would seem if one goes by the headlines and the front pages of major newspapers in the country on Friday as there was not even a passing reference to him despite his having already met 40 top executives from America, many Fortune 500 CEOs, media moguls and investors.This is in stark contrast to the enthusiasm of the Indian media over his visit that has been propelling expectations back home from the potential benefits that will accrue to Indian commerce and industry after Modi is done wooing the American industry.

&gt; * Only exception among the top news dailies of the country was the San Jose Mercury News from California, which carried a small snippet on Modi's visit and expectations back home on the front page on Friday since the Indian prime minister is scheduled to address a large audience there at SAP Center on September 27.

I wish AAP themselves believed in that statement, rather than just their fans on sites like reddit. 

If they believed it, they would **actually fight** elections in other states. Till that time, they are nothing more than some far off party doing supposedly some good work in a far off city for other mortals like us. 

&gt; Mostly Modi fans.

One day you will grow up, and realize that none of the so called Modi fans are not modi fans by birth. We don't like his face nor does he send a monthly stipend to us. He just seems the least worst option we have at a national level. 

Let Kejriwal fight and win in other states. Soon you will have the country go ga-ga for him. But he needs to fight first. 

Fight! Like he should have fought the municipal elections in BBMP. I would have voted for him, just to get the shit congress and BJP parties in this state to get a shock. But, sorry. That didn't happen. We keep waiting.

214,"Lt Governor Najeeb Jung good man with bad political bosses: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP MP demanded his removal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal surprisingly came out in defence of Lt Governor Najeeb Jung , saying he was just following directives of the PMO and that he is a good man with bad political bosses.Notwithstanding his confrontation with the Lt Governor over a number of contentious issues, Kejriwal said Jung's removal will not help as the ""real solution"" lies in the Prime Minister's Office stopping ""interference"" in Delhi's affairs.

&gt;* ""Congress and BJP both demanding Sh Najeeb Jung's removal?

&gt;* Real solution is PMO should stop interfering in Delhi,"" the Delhi Chief Minister tweeted.In another tweet, he said, ""Najeeb Jung is a good man with bad political bosses.

&gt;* ""The Chief Minister's comments in support of Jung came a day after BJP MP Udit Raj demanded his ""removal"" calling him a ""super king"" who does not heed to views of elected representatives.Raj was apparently angry with Jung for arresting three of his supporters for allegedly assaulting North West Delhi District Magistrate Sanjay Goel in outer Delhi's Kanjhawla area on Thursday.

&gt;* The MP accused police of acting under pressure from bureaucrats.Though BJP has not demanded Jung's removal, a section of the party's Delhi unit was in favour of his ouster.The AAP government and LG were locked in a fierce confrontation over number of issues including control over the the Anti-Corruption Branch and appointment of a Commission of Inquiry to probe the multi-crore CNG fitness scam.Earlier this week, Kejriwal had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the ""unprecedented"" situation arising due to differences between his government and the Centre and said he was ready to go the ""extra mile"" to settle them for sake of the city's development.In a letter to Modi, Kejriwal had said Delhi's development has been hit by the fissures between the two sides and that there should be no reason why the two ""well-meaning"" governments cannot resolve their differences.

215,"&gt;&gt; AAP is easily by far 

&gt;Not so convinced by this. On paper this was probably true before they actually won. But now you can see that AAP also has its failures. In less than a year it has also managed to disenchant a lot of supporters because of their policies and internal politics. No way of knowing how they will emerge 4 years from now.

Welcome to the reality of Indian politics. 

This country is so corrupt and full of idiots that being honest and righteous is a sin.

AAP's Tomar was jailed by the Delhi police for his fake degree, while the PM of the country gets away with the same shit. People with serious charges of rape, murder and genocide are sitting in the Parliament. And you will find educated people even on this sub, spending time to defend them.

I prefer to support the best available alternative, instead of waiting for some imaginary utopian party. 

Also, I think the constant negative feedback by the Modi fans has influenced your opinion.",2015-09-26 16:06:20

217,"&gt;They did promise internal transparency and democracy when they formed the party and asked for donations. So many people would want to hold them accountable to that. They are free to come out and admit that they will no longer be able to do this, instead of pretending that there is democracy inside. 

I guess you are referring to YY/PB. Guess how many seats they would have won in Delhi if YY/PB were in charge. I personally like both YY and PB and their stand on many things, but in the real world you have to win elections first. Then you can get things done. And Kejriwal is the guy who won the elections. These two did not like that.

This is India. What transparency and democracy are you talking about? Last day there was a show by Aaj Tak where they slandered AAP. Guess why? You think the rules are the same for all parties? Would they do the same with the Congress/BJP? I think not.

&gt;Maybe it is impossible to run a party with total democracy, just like you can't run a company. But then they need to acknowledge that their idealism isn't feasible. 

I guess that is implied now.

&gt;I do not hate AAP but I do feel that the dream that was AAP is technically dead. AAP is just another political party in the arena. They might be more honest than others for now, but then they have also been in politics for the least amount of time, so have not had a chance to get jaded. Let us see how things pan out in the coming years.

Thanks to the Indian crab mentality. Also stop listening to the negativity being spread by the Modi worshippers.

&gt;&gt; which I think they were able to do.

&gt;In some cases and then they did not in some others. Anecdotal: My friends and I have been trying to get some work done in our constituency. It has not happened at all. Simple stuff like stopping water from clogging. I understand that BJP runs the MCD, but at the end of the day I will hold my MLA accountable too. My friends still do not know of any local *sabhas*/meetings that were promised. On the upside though, it was very easy to arrange a meeting with the MLA and he was empathetic. But work still has not been done. *Aise mein voter kya kare?* This is exactly the situation AAP had promised to change.  

Yeah, now blame the BJP MCD's incompetence on the AAP. Read up on the Stockholm syndrome while you're at it. Thanks.",2015-09-26 16:41:35

They are always trying to spread their reach. Hindus are their vote bank.

&gt; * Instead, the focus will be on the company's powerpack and energy storage systems - that go beyond the car - which India believes has greater relevance to the country's energy needs.Modi will be welcomed by the Tesla's Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel and the Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja and will get a brief walk through the production area before Straubel, a storage and renewable energy expert, will talk to him about energy storage production and show him powerpack displays.An alumnus of Stanforn, Straubel oversees the technical and engineering design of the vehicles at Tesla, but more pertinently for India, is also on the Board of Directors for SolarCity a fast-growing US company that installs solar power systems.

&gt; * He also teaches a popular Energy Storage Integration class in the Atmosphere and Energy Program at Stanford.CFO Deepak Ahuja has already put in his papers at Tesla but has stayed back for the PM's engagement.The PM will then get a general assembly tour before CEO Elon Musk joins the group.

&gt; * Musk will discuss Tesla's vision, innovative technology and Tesla Energy before the meeting wraps up.

&gt; * Since the shock collapse of his party on 16 May 2014, ""the centrepiece of Rahul Gandhi's game plan is to ensure that Prime Minister Modi does not get a second term, and if this means sacrificing the short-term interests of the Congress in some states, Rahul is ready"".

&gt; * Dont get me wrong, the secularist who laments that her son is forced to read Sanskrit as an obligatory third language  albeit high scoring  rather than French, German or even Mandarin, isnt a Hindu hater.

&gt; * At best the Modi bhakt was like the proverbial Pandey ji who taught Hindi and Sanskrit in English-medium schools and who, invariably, was the butt of jokes that reeked of social condescension.

&gt; * In the past three days, in response to Modis jibe in Ireland, a large number of media liberals have gone on record to say that they are not against Sanskrit but only its contrived association with saffron politics.

&gt;* And the fact that little Nepalese children (the cutest in the world) waved back at Modi as the 56-inch giant strolled barrel-chested down their roads was played up as a huge diplomatic success.The truth took another three months to hit home.

&gt;* On his way to Kathmandu for the SAARC summit in November 2014, Modi sought to make a stop-over at Janakpur in the Madhesi plains to address a huge public gathering there as if he were on Indian, not Nepali, soil.

&gt;* One cannot play with the sovereignty of another country to gain cheap points in a domestic electoral contest.The end result is that the same Modi who was hailed a year ago as Nepal's best friend is now reviled as an interfering megalomaniac.

&gt;* The purpose of the visit was to reiterate Modi's warning to the Nepalese that they should desist from proclaiming their Constitution until seven major amendments prosed by India were accepted without demur by sovereign Nepal.

&gt;* He goes onto condemn the special envoy's ""brute way"" of ""delivery... making no pretense of courtesy and decorum"" adding, ""his stiff body language and the harsh tone matched the arrogance of British Viceroy, Lord Curzon"".

271,"TBH, I was surprised to not find 'Kerala' at the top but then soon realized OP had worded his request for participation saying he wants to know where users are *located*, as opposed to their linguistic/ethnic background.

Quite a few such surveys had established that Malayalees form the largest chunk of users here.

But considering TN has been producing a jobs at a rate more than Gujarat and even Maharashtra, coupled with the 'Kerala model' that is increasingly being questioned for it's financial contribution to the national economy, it becomes clear TN would have cornered a big chunk of Malayalees looking for jobs which is why Kerala is quite lower down in this OP's list.

The skew of topics and comments shows a few interesting trends - Malayalees probably held the pro-secular bastion in the pre-AAP days; they were joined by AAP supporters who distinctly give off the Delhi/Punjab/Haryana vibe. The other big group is obviously pro-BJP and pro-Modi supporters; the former defends a lot of things Hindu while the latter will not hesitate to condemn anything Hindu that might be seen as tarnishing the image of their leader.

The large number of southerners also explains why, despite lamentations that the world despises us as a nation of rapists, this sub itself often upvotes news about rape especially in northern India, right to the front page! A lot of this behavior is probably rooted in the deep seated resentment against northerners allegedly trying to impose their culture, language on the rest of the nation.

Treatment of Maharashtra and Karnataka topics here is interesting - submissions about pro-Marathi or pro-Kannada measures gets upvoted and a lot of nasty, angry comments while those about far worse things happening elsewhere in the nation barely reaches front page. Guess that's the price to be paid for harboring cosmopolitanism.

Amusingly, some users who post stuff about/have strong opinions about things happening in Maharashtra/Karnataka avoid giving visibility to similar happenings in their own state. For example, I was once told off how badly mismanaged Mumbai Metro is turning out to be, and just in the next few days, there was news of a horrible accident that happened at the Chennai Metro construction site. *I* posted it, it reached front page which is when *another* user from TN blew the lid (for the rest of us here), on how Chennai Metro has been messed up too! The same user once told me how Maharashtra is a cesspool of caste politics (this was probably during the Maratha reservation thing), and just a few days later, another TN user ticked off the same Tamil warrior how TN society is a basket case as far as caste-based discrimination is concerned! Said warrior also once described how Chennai is an oh-so-awesomely-cosmopolitan city which is when I had to bring to his notice the ethnic minorities he mentioned as living in perfect harmony in Chennai, were all ethnic Dravidian groups, no match for the kind of diversity you see in Bengaluru or a large Maharashtra city!

280,"Don't downvote this to hell if I'm wrong but from whatever I can recall from three years of studying business administration and reading countless articles, Modi is trying to create jobs in India by attracting FDIs. When these big companies come to India to set up their plants, that would lead to job creation, increased cash inflow and what **most people are overlooking is the technology transfer and spillover thats bound to happen with FDI.** Because our country is a labour intensive country, manufacturers of products that require cheap inputs of labour will choose countries that can provide the same. Due to lack of innovation, we Indians arent being able to develop our own technological systems that can employ people in a large scale setting, so the quickest way to go about it is to influence already established players to set up base in India and provide them with incentives etc. Not to mention the countless indirect jobs that are created with the influx of a major player in the industry.

As Mr. Murthy said, there hasn't been any epic innovation from Indians in the last couple of decades that has taken the world by storm, Modi is perhaps trying to initiate a technological transfer so we Indians can reach a significant position first by learning and imitating other countries like USA, Germany etc. and then use the cultivated knowledge and talent base to take the world by storm with our ""Make in India"" products.

And as for Kejriwal, taunting at Modi wont make things any better. Try to look at the positives and look at the situation realistically. If you're so damn good, then why don't you do what Modi is not being able to do?

&gt; * Blocked from China itself or frustrated by the onerous demands of its government, companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as start-ups and investors, see India as the next best thing.

&gt; * Now I have a chance to actually do this,'"" said Punit Soni, a former Google executive who was lured back to India recently to become the chief product officer of Flipkart, a Bangalore e-commerce start-up similar to Amazon.The increasing appeal of India, now the world's fastest growing major economy, was underscored in recent days.During a meeting in Seattle on Wednesday with American technology executives, China's president, Xi Jinping, was unwavering on his government's tough internet policies.India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, on the other hand, was on a charm offensive during his own American tour.After a stop in New York City, he headed to Silicon Valley, where he visited Tesla and attended a dinner with tech chieftains like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google.On Sunday, Modi will join a town hall discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive.

&gt; * Last year, Facebook received 10,792 requests from the Indian government to remove information, far more than from any other country.Making money is also difficult in India, where the amount spent on digital advertising is expected to total about $940 million this year, according to eMarketer  a fraction of the $58 billion that is expected to be spent in the United States.While revenue is tiny so far, internet companies say they are playing the long game, focusing on getting more people online now and profiting later.Google, for example, wants 500 million Indians online by 2017.

&gt; * ""We've always believed that what's good for the internet is good for Google,"" Sandeep Menon, Google's head of marketing in India, said in an interview at the company's offices in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi.The effort to get more Indians online, however, has forced tech companies to re-examine some fundamental assumptions.Only one in six Indians know enough English to surf the web in the language.

&gt; * ""The RSS chief has publicly called for review of the reservation policy which the BJP-led coalition at the centre may scrap if NDA gets power in Bihar,"" Kumar alleged at an election rally in Parbatta Assembly constituency in Khagaria district.The victory of the BJP-led alliance will embolden NDA to toe the RSS line and scrap the existing reservation policy, he alleged.Kumar promised 35 per cent reservation to women in government jobs if his alliance (JDU-RJD-Cong) comes back to power at the hustings.He also took umbrage to BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular for ridiculing him on his Rs 2.70 lakh crore vision for development of the state over next five years if his own alliance wins the election.

&gt; * ""You don't worry about how we will raise resources.

&gt; * We have enough sources of revenue to fulfil aspirations of the people on development front,"" Kumar said.The Chief Minister said he has charted out the vision document after taking into account various sources from which revenues will be raised in coming years and not from any dole by anybody, he said referring to the Centre.The Prime Minister had ridiculed Kumar's vision document last month and asked him from where he will raise funds to implement his development agenda.The senior JD(U) leader, who launched the secular alliance's campaign yesterday, flayed the NDA government for ""non-fulfilment"" of promises, including bringing back black money from foreign shores, and asked the Prime Minister what happened to his poll promise to distribute Rs 15 to Rs 20 lakh cash into bank account of every individual.Kumar also slammed the 'Gujarat Model' of development, a plank on which Modi had won the Lok Sabha poll last year, and alleged the pitiable condition of women and prevalence of unemployment in the PM's native state tell a different story compared to the claims made about development there.In all, the Chief Minister addressed five election meetings during the day.

Even Zuckerberg's in a suit -- a guy who I have mostly seen in tees till now. Stands to reason it was advertised as a very formal affair. Many ettiquette guides put the sleeveless as a tad ""casual"". Sleeveless designer dresses being available on the market does not negate this fact.

Shouldn't they have asked the ladies to come in pantsuits, if appearing ""prude"" was to be the aim?",2015-09-28 07:53:22

Yes, they knew sleeves and skirts are what constitutes prudish behavior in the eyes of Modi.  You once again are second guessing their intentions, solely on your judgement of Modi. Not everything revolves around him, you know.

The trouble is most of us only think of glossy, clean roads and high buidings when we think of development. That's actually a very low hanging fruit. Think about it - the government claims to be building 30 kilometers of highways every day. We have the money for that. 

How long should it take for someone to do those road-building inside cities? Not very long. And if we start today, the 100 biggest cities should have neat concrete roads in the next five years. For glossy buildings, all it takes is to increase FSI which in India is grossly under par. 

If Modi returns to power in 2019, I expect him to take up the challenge of building city roads - although that's not his mandate today. It's too much of a low hanging fruit to let go.

405,"1. Most people won't bother finding out what Digital India is, and like I said, are more likely to associate it with internet connectivity. My post had less to do with what DI is and more to do with how facebook is going to use it to its advantage.

2. There doesn't have to a direct mention of internet.org for facebook to take advantage of Digital India to promote internet.org. And yes, of course, there are no facts, and everything I say is my opinion and speculation. But that doesn't mean it's incorrect. People don't always tell us exactly what they're intending to do, but we are still able to deduce things from their actions and we are still able to predict likely behaviour from them. This also really makes me think you really don't know how marketing works. As they say, any publicity is good publicity (something I disagree with, partially). But good publicity is priceless. Because of its tremendous reach, facebook is in a prime position to take advtange of associating itself with something that sounds positive like ""Digital India"" (Note: I'm not saying that DI is not positive. I'm coming from a purely marketing standpoint where even the branding of ""Digital India"" sounds great). The point you made about Zuckerberg and facebook getting so much facetime despite Modi having met all of those other Silicon Valley leaders is a case in point. Because all of us log on to facebook every day, Facebook can advertise its association with Digital India far better than anyone else can.

3. Marketing works by subconscious conditioning. It doesn't work on everyone, but it doesn't have to. It just has to work on most people. Many (if not most) people will not really bother finding out what Digital India is about, but it sounds great. Facebook supports Digital India, Facebook created that awesome Display Picture tool which allows me to also support Digital India (which sounds great, whatever it is!) by changing my display picture (just like how I supported those poor cartoonists of charlie hebdo by posting #jesuischarlie.

Nominal GDP is USD2trn, as you said. 

PPP GDP is USD8trn which Modi wants to make USD20trn. Let's give him 10 years. That's growth of 9.5% per year.

Assuming the PPP gdp and nominal GDP ratio remains same over the period, so the USD2trn nominal GDP would need to be USD5trn in 10 years (same growth of 9.5% per year). 

Now here comes the catch.  

Over the last ten years (2004-2014), the real gdp grew by about 6.8%, but [nominal gdp grew by 11.4% to take it to USD2trn](http://www.ceicdata.com/en/statistics/India/Nominal-GDP). 

The difference is on account of inflation and currency movements (USD/INR).

So, even if the real gdp growth for the next ten years is just 5%, inflation is 4.5% and Rupee remains stable against dollar, we will have a 9.5% cagr and achieve a USD5trn nominal GDP and possibly USD20trn PPP GDP.  ",2015-09-28 11:06:01

&gt;* The BJP, despite the seriousness of the allegation, was temperate in its reaction, with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh asserting tickets were distributed fairly.

&gt;* Union Minister Ravishankar Prasad, who was in Bihar for campaigning, and Sushil Kumar Modi, dismissed Mr. Singhs claim about tickets having been sold to criminals.

&gt;* Mr. Prasad, a Rajya Sabha member from the State, said: In the BJP, ticket is given to a nominee after transparent discussion by senior leaders.

&gt;* Every leader in Bihar needs to ensure that jungle raj part II doesnt come and, at the same time, it is important that party discipline and restraint is maintained, he said.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: In a stinging attack at Congress for questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi's devotion to his mother, BJP today said Sonia Gandhi was ""ruining"" Congress in her ""devotion to her inept son"" that has made Rahul Gandhi the ""spoilt child"" of the Indian politics.Describing as ""appalling and pathetic"" opposition party's dig at Modi over his turning emotional while mentioning his mother, BJP accused it of becoming voice of ""untruth, malice and utter frustration"" and wondered if it had become ""trapped in an inept leadership"".

&gt; * He is devoted to his mother.

&gt; * ""The frustration of Congress is also evident in the huge positive response Modi has generated from the giants of intellect and innovation, from the leaders of the future who can see another leader of the future in their midst,"" he said.Referring to Modi breaking down while recalling events about his mother, Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma had said, ""True to his characteristic style, the prime minister once again engaged in theatrics, emotion and drama, making boastful claims"".Sharma questioned as to why Modi did not keep her at his official residence to look after her.BJP also continued to target the Congress vice president over his trip to the US even as Rahul tweeted photograph of himself at a conference in Aspen.

&gt; * ""Instead of hiding underground somewhere in the US and posting highly nebulous picture of some alleged conference, it might have been a better idea for him to come out and explain what he was doing except of course if he is enjoying some undeserved vacation,"" Akbar said.Taking a dig, another BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said his party had forced Congress to ""turn"" a vacation of Rahul into a photo-op of him attending a conference.Noting that Modi's mother continued to live in her humble house, the BJP spokesman asked Congress to have ""some shame"".Taking a swipe at Congress for taking credit for most of the projects pushed by the Modi government, Akbar mockingly said the only thing it had not taken credit for is creating Garden of Eden.

&gt; * ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an astute politician with the ability to outsmart rivals and he is aiming for the ""political and military dominance of India"", said a Pakistani daily that noted he was ""received like a star"" in the US.An editorial in The Nation on Monday said that everyone loves a good old showdown between politicians - but in the case of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif versus his Indian counterpart Modi, ""we have our backs to the wall"".

&gt; * ""While Modi is received like a star is attending events and parties, PM Sharif only has the UN platform to make an impact.

&gt; * ""What is Nawaz Sharif doing?, the daily asked.

&gt; * We on the other hand, are stuck with archaic, redundant policies of following the same deadbeat formula of 'successes',"" it said.Calling for a drastic improvement of the Pakistani image in the west, the daily said: ""The US is helping India get armed to the hilt and soon we will lose our only advantage- our military strength.
