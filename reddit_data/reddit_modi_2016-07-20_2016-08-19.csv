6,"As a general rule of thumb, the more an Indian politician like Modi or anybody else talks about India being China's equal in 21st century, The more I know he's an empty vessel that is full of talk and no action.

How many reforms have Modi passed since he was elected? 7 out of 30 promised? Good luck with that. And we haven't approached birth control. Barring a mass genocide or mass drought or a virus outbreak or a mass disaster that reduces India's population to below one billion, there's nothing much India can do in the 21st century other than be burdened by the poor unfortunately.

Every East Asian leadership with the the British &amp; Portuguese leadership in Hong Kong &amp; Macau plus Mao Zedong, Lee Kuan Yew, Chiang Kai Shek, Park Chung Hee and Shigeru Yoshida all identified Birth Control as an urgent issue either forced contraceptives, abortion or forced one or two child policies on their populace before they went on to implement other educational, economical or infrastructural policies and found it easier to execute because you have lesser mouths to feed. 

Mind you, China and East Asia used to worse off than India in many statistics but their Authoritarian leadership saved their arses post ww2 if not they wouldn't become first world and would probably be as dirt poor as India now.

It isn't rocket science to be honest. It's like opening a water tap. If Modi is as politically incorrect as he claims to be, he would have openly identified this problem the moment he got elected and at least get a common consensus  to tackle this issue head on instead he went silent on this issue and talked about how he wants India to equal to China in the 21st century which really only confirms that he's not really that much different from your average loudmouth Indian politician.

So the endless cycle continues with the poor voting in those loudmouth votebank/freebie politicians in with no economic/developmental plans in mind for the coming decades to prepare for automation and other technological advancements and you want to talk about challenging China and being China's equal in the 21st century?

Most NRIs seem not to understand the gravity of this issue that's why they like to make boastful claims about taking over China and East Asia when talking to other foreigners which makes them look like idiots in the international community especially within the East Asian community whom view many South Asians as people who talk a lot and can't get anything done which is why only White Europeans can rise through the ranks of East Asian MNCs because they actually deliver results instead of scamming and backstabbing their way to the top like those Indian CEOs in the United States.

Only thing an Indian can do now instead of blaming racism or colonialism is to educate their next generation with a more pragmatic viewpoint of the world and be more accepting and tolerating of the unpleasant circumstances that come your way internationally and be expected to be treated like crap because your motherland is a joke and you will treated as a joke because the situation ain't gonna turn for the better until the 22nd century at least according to the birth rate trends. 

The Chinese and East Asians learned that early on post ww2 and made no mistake riding the manufacturing wave of the 60s/70s/80s that's why their descendants are enjoying the fruits of their labour today as respected expats and not being treated like potential illegals, louts, rapists and criminals in many first world countries around the world.",2016-07-20 04:50:42

&gt; * ""We have always supported the GST.

&gt; * Our party fully supports it,"" Kumar told the media after the meeting.The Bihar CM announced his support for GST after his meeting with Jaitley, joining the ranks of other non-NDA parties Trianmool Congress, Biju Janata Dal and Samajwadi Party which have come out in the open to support the reforms measure.

&gt; * During the meeting, Kumar is understood to have sought release of funds under the backward region grant and financial support for a student card the state government is planning.The CM's support for the legislation is important for the NDA, which has launched yet another round of discussions with CMs and regional parties in a bid to ensure the bill's passage in Rajya Sabha, where it lacks majority.

http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/clearing-the-air-on-lpg-direct-benefit-transfer-subsidies/

He said based on A-B like testing on certain pilot areas, the government saves 24 percent of total expense using DBT.  And, IF DBT WAS ROLLED OUT EVERYWHERE, the ESTIMATED potential ANNUAL savings would be 12.7 k crore.  The estimate was based on total spent on LPG subsidy spending the previous year - roughly 24 percent of total LPG expense from that previous year.

What Modi and company have done is used that number in their  claims now that LPG is almost fully on DBT.  In the meanwhile, due to fall in prices, the total spending on LPG itself has decreased - so the 24 percent savings due to DBT have also decreased.

  NEW DELHI: The Congress has taken the battle to the BJP over the thrashing of four Dalit youth in Gujarat's Una. Party vice president [Rahul Gandhi](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rahul-Gandhi) is set to visit the town on Thursday. But in an embarrassment to the Congress, its scion seemed to be dozing through Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh's speech on the issue in the Lok Sabha.

We must take it up as a challenge. I urge all parties to come together to fight this,"" Rajnath Singh said while making a statement on the Una attack in the Lok Sabha.

Rajnath said PM Narendra Modi condemned the attack as soon as he got to know about the incident.

The home minister said that there has been a sharp decline in 

attacks on Dalits

 in Gujarat since the BJP is in power. ""During Congress rule in Gujarat, number of cases of atrocities against Dalits were much high,"" Rajnath said.Opposition disrupts Rajya Sabha

Opposition 

 led by Congress on Tuesday forced two adjournments of the Rajya Sabha in the pre-noon session over attacks of Dalits in Gujarat.Main opposition Congress, BSP and TMC competed with each other in trying to raise the issue more vociferously, throwing the House into a pandemonium and forcing two adjournments, first for 10 minutes and then for about 30 minutes till noon.

No sooner the listed papers were laid, Derek O'Brien (TMC) was up on his feet raising the issue. ""Dalits are being oppressed in Gujarat but it is not being discussed here,"" he said as other members joined in.

""This is an organised crime that is happening in Gujarat ... this issue should be taken up,"" he said referring to the stripping and assault on some Dalit men in Gujarat allegedly by members of a local cow vigilante group.

By this time, Congress and BSP members too were on their feet with Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad seeking permission to speak.

Deputy Chairman P J Kurien allowed him but Mayawati (BSP) appeared eager to speak before him saying she wanted to raise a 'point-of-order'.

Congress members asked under what rule does she want to raise point of order as they rushed into the well shouting slogans against the government. They contended that Azad should speak first.

Kurien pleaded with them to return to their seats and let Mayawati, who ""is our sister"", be allowed to raise her point of order first.

But as none relented, he was forced to adjourn the House for 10 minutes.

When the House met after the brief break, Congress members rushed into the well shouting slogans like ""Dalit Virodhi yeh sarkar nahi chalegi, nahi chalegi (this anti-dalit government will not be tolerated).""

BSP members followed suit and matched Congress members in slogan shouting.

In the melee, minister for social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot got up to make a statement but his submission could not be heard in the din.

Nevertheless, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi prodded him to continue speaking and make his statement.

In the din, Gehlot could only be heard as saying that the state government had taken prompt action over the incident and arrested the accused persons. An inquiry has been ordered and strict action would be taken against those found guilty, he added.

Washington:  US companies consider India their next FDI frontier and are keen to pump in billions of dollars into the country's infrastructure and transportation sector, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has said.
""There is overwhelming enthusiasm among American companies and investors to invest in India. Results could be seen soon,"" Road Transport and Highways Minister Gadkari told PTI as he concluded his week-long trip to the US that took him to Washington, New York, St Louis, San Francisco and Los Angeles.


Acknowledging that India's infrastructure sector is lagging behind and it has a long way to go to match the international standards, Mr Gadkari said that the modernisation and upgradation of the transport infrastructure has the potential to become driver of the country's growth.

Now that the Modi Government has taken several steps to facilitate smooth and hassle-free foreign direct investment in the infrastructure sector, Mr Gadkari said based on his interaction and meetings in the US he is confident that billions of dollars would soon start flowing into India.
Mr Gadkari said in addition to construction of a road network across the country, the ambitious Sagarmala project along with promoting use of green fuel and clean energy vehicles would create a large number of jobs in the country and provided an unprecedented boost to the Indian economy.


During his week-long trip, Mr Gadkari held a series of productive interactions with investment bankers, fund managers and captains of trade and industry in infrastructure sector.


These meetings, he noted, helped in dispelled apprehensions with regard to bottlenecks and red-tape in the Indian government.


""Prime Minister Modi has made the infrastructure development top-most priority of his government, I told them,"" he said, adding that the US companies now consider India their next frontier of foreign direct investment.


""The Prime Minister remains committed to improving the country's road, highways, and port connectivity in a time-bound, result-oriented, corruption-free and transparent manner through e-governance and fast-tracking decision-making process,"" he said.


""I am returning home fully satisfied with his visit which has broken new grounds in the bilateral ties between India and the US and given the much needed impetus to cooperation in the field of infrastructure, particularly road transport, highways and shipping sectors,"" Mr Gadkari said. In his talks with the US Transportation Secretary


Anthony Foxx, he sought cooperation in sharing intelligent traffic systems and transfer of technology in road engineering, use of IT in reducing road accidents, centrally controlled traffic light surveillance systems for road safety.


During his visit to Tesla, Mr Gadkari asked it to make India their Asia manufacturing hub and offered land near major Indian ports to facilitate export of their vehicles to South and South East Asian countries.


Mr Gadkari said India is committed to encouraging alternate pollution free transport in the country by providing incentives to bio-fuel, CNG, Ethanol and electric vehicles.

___

&gt;[Retail inflation in rural areas has consistently outpaced urban areas in the past 18 mths, hitting 6.2% in June, well above 5.26% in cities like Mumbai SISAULI: The next](http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-53323402,width-310,resizemode-4,imglength-66228/new-rbi-chief-will-face-stubborn-old-foe-rural-inflation.jpg)
___

  SISAULI: The next [Reserve Bank of India](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Reserve-Bank-of-India) (RBI) governor could learn a lot about stubbornly high prices in rural areas by driving down a ramshackle road in Uttar Pradesh state to talk to small farmers like Dharmendra Malik.  
 
  After cooling last year due largely to lower oil prices, India's old nemesis inflation is back on the prowl and is threatening to breach the RBI target, a harsh welcome for its new chief who is expected to be appointed soon.  
 
  Rising prices are also feeding rural perceptions that PM [Narendra Modi](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi) increasingly favours the urban middle class, a key voter base. Millions of government employees recently received hefty pay hikes, while more farmers are going bust.  
 
  The dusty village of Sisauli puts the dilemma facing the country's policymakers into clear focus.  
 
  Sisuali is three hours by rough road from New Delhi, making transporting goods difficult and expensive.  
 
  Layers of middlemen also clog the supply chain and take their cuts. Some farmers say their produce can go through at least four intermediaries before reaching customers.  
 
  Malik says he sold rice for Rs 16 a kilogram to a middle man. In a market 10 minutes away, it retails for three times as much.  
 
  ""Inflation has come down only on paper; in reality, there is no let up in surging prices,"" Sudhir Kumar said in his grocery shop, which also has a small TV set he uses to keep an eye on commodity prices.  
 
 DECADES OF NEGLECT BUBBLING OVER  Rural India has long suffered from neglect, but tensions are rising as food prices have surged after two years of drought.  
 
  Retail inflation in rural areas has consistently outpaced urban areas in the past 18 months, hitting 6.20 per cent in June, well above 5.26 per cent in cities such as Mumbai.  
 
  That has pushed overall inflation to a near two-year high of 5.77 per cent in June, near the upper end of the RBI's 2-6 per cent inflation target.  
 
  RBI officials have stressed that many of the causes are structural and beyond the central bank's control, but the spike in inflation could complicate the next governor's job.  
 
  Though India has become the world's fastest growing large [economy](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/economy), political pressure on the RBI is growing to cut interest rates more aggressively to spur full employment, at the risk of unleashing even stronger inflationary forces.  
 
  Outgoing Governor [Raghuram Rajan](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Raghuram-Rajan) was lauded by investors for introducing inflation targeting last year, restoring the RBI's credibility by linking price management to numerical targets. Investors are closely watching to see if his successor will stick to tough targets or water them down.  
 
  Economists polled by Reuters see only one more rate cut over the next year, if inflation does not pick-up too sharply.  
 
 NO EASY FIXES  Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is already facing a tough electoral test in the state next year. Uttar Pradesh will be a crucial test for its re-election bid in 2019.  
 
  ""You are not ready to pay more to farmers because that is bad economics,"" said Malik. ""But no one complains when hefty pay increases are given to government employees.""  
 
  The government is making some strides. It is spending on infrastructure and is seeking to weed out middlemen by giving farmers an option of selling their goods across India via electronic trading platforms set up at wholesale markets.  
 
  But progress is slow, and middlemen continue to hold sway as farmers lack the means to ship directly to buyers.  
 
  Rate cuts would do little for villagers such as Narpendar Jhinjha, a heavily indebted 52-year-old farmer, who says another bad year will force him to sell his land.  
 
  ""A farmer is hit on both sides,"" Jhinja said, referring to low crop prices and higher prices for goods he needs to buy.  
 
  ""And on top of that we have our loans to pay for. Farmers have been condemned to a life of misery.""

New Delhi: Empowering private persons to seek sanction for prosecution of IAS officers in corruption cases, the Modi government has outlined the procedure for handling such requests and set a three-month deadline for their disposal.  As per the proposed guidelines, a request for prosecution sanction may be routed through either the state government or the central ministry/department where the civil servant is employed, allowing them to conduct a preliminary probe before it is taken up by the department of personnel and training for a decision . 

 The guidelines - shared on Thursday by DoPT with all states/UTs and central ministries/departments for their comments to be submitted by August 12 - are a first since the Supreme Court, in a 2012 ruling in Dr Subramanian Swamy Vs Manmohan Singh case, held that there is no provision in the PCA or CrPC that bars a citizen from filing a complaint for prosecution of a public servant alleged to have committed an offence. 

 The court said it deemed proper to observe that in future every competent authority shall take appropriate action on the representation made by a citizen for sanction of the prosecution of a public servant, so as to identify and obviate the areas causing delays in processing of such proposals. 



Sharing that the SC verdict triggered a flow of such requests from private citizens, DoPT said many, however, were in nature in complaints rather than a proper proposal. 

 ""Keeping in view the basic parameters and requirements for cases received from investigating agencies, it has been decided that the procedure for handling the requests for prosecution sanction received from private citizens may be streamlined,"" the DoPT said adding that such proposals may now be routed through the concerned state government or central department/ministry ""as it is best placed to provide basic inputs as regards misconduct of concerned public servant"". Even where the proposal is directly received by DoPT, the same may be sent first to the concerned state government or Central departments. for preliminary examination. 

 If a prima facie case against the IAS officer is made out, the state government or Central department would have to prepare a detailed report and consider obtaining version of the said officer. Such report along with relevant records and evidence should then be fowarded to DoPT with approval of the competent authority. Where no prima facie case is warranted for misconduct or corruption, the private citizen may be so informed and a copy shared with DoPT, say the proposed guidelines.On receipt of a report and evidence backing a prima facie case, action may be initiated for processing the matter for decision of the competent authority. 

Importantly, the DoPT guidelines set a three-month time limit for disposing of prosecution sanction requests from private persons, starting from the date of receipt of complete proposal with all relevant material and aforesaid report from the concerned state government of central department or ministry.

70,"Dalits in Maharashtra are angry at the demolition of a Mumbai building where Babasaheb Ambedkar worked.

---

&gt; * In Mumbai, the demolition last month of Ambedkar Bhavan, a building closely associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar has unified Dalits belonging to different parties.

&gt; * The BJP is worried that recent steps to please the states Dalits  such as the induction of Ramdas Athavale in the Union cabinet and the purchase, last year, of a house in London where the young Ambedkar lived, for 3.1 million pounds  will come to naught.

&gt; * As it is, the BJP in Maharashtra is known as a party of Bhats and Sheths (Brahmins and Moneybag traders), which has no time for Dalits.

&gt; * Prakash Ambedkar has given a call that Dalits should congregate at the site on July 30 and begin rebuilding the Bhavan, with their own hands. This could take away supporters from BJP ally Ramdas Athavale of the Republican Party of India  and a recent inductee in the Modi cabinet  and cost the BJP dearly.

___

 Chief Minister [Siddaramaiah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Siddaramaiah) has come out strongly in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's proposal that Lok Sabha and Assembly polls should be held together. He also said the Centre's move to censor posts by civil servants on social media sites was correct and made a plea to all political parties to not politicise Parliament and Assembly proceedings.Excerpts from an interview: 
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has mooted a proposal for Lok Sabha and Assembly polls to be held together. Will this have any political fallout? 
  I hold the same opinion as the PM on this issue. Such a move reduces expenditure and helps governance. All developmental activities come to a halt due to the code of conduct imposed for various elections. In the past one year, we continuously had a code of conduct imposed in one or the other section of Karnataka due to graduates and teachers constituency elections, taluk and zilla panchayat elections, byelections, Parliament, assembly, Upper House and so on. At least, if the assembly and parliament elections are held together, it will help. In 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, elections were held together, what political impact did it have? In 1967, the Congress lost even in UP, while other parties won in other states also. It will be good to hold the elections together and all political parties should come to a joint decision on this.  
 
 Is a consensus evolving on the GST? 
  In principle, we have agreed to the GST. There are some objections which we have raised, which they have to address. That is all. It is just (Bihar CM) Nitish Kumar's personal opinion that there should not be a cap on the rate (while) we have said we want an 18% cap. I have said that the revenue of our state and other states has to be protected. Whether it is Ananthkumar or Arun Jaitley handling parliamentary affairs, our stand is the same.  
 
 Parliamentary proceedings have been disrupted on various issues frequently and a perception is growing that no real business can be transacted there.You have faced a similar situation in the state legislature... 
  It (disruption) is wrong. All issues should not be politicised or seen in terms of political gain. Parliament and legislature are the fora in a democratic set-up to discuss issues, make legislation. Discussion has to happen. It applies to all political parties, not confined to one or the other.  
 
 What do you think about the moves towards a common civil code? 
  It should be debated at the national level, from all angles and (by) all sections of the society. Our society is a very diversified one, it needs consensus before a common civil code can be applied.  
 
 The centre has come out with a guideline that civil servants should not post criticism against the government on social media sites. Isn't this against personal freedom? 
  That decision is correct. People who are working in the government should not be making comments against it. That is not permissible. I agree with that order.  
 
 How do you see the situation in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls? 
  The BJP will definitely not come to power in UP. It has no base there. The situation in the lead up to the parliament polls in 2014 is not there now. Let us see who Congress will align with, then we will get a clear picture on what will happen there.  
 
 Do you see a bigger national role for Priyanka Vadra? 
  Priyanka has been working on the Lok Sabha constituencies of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi all these years. Now she will go all over UP and that is certainly a big role. She will do it well and it may lead to a national role.  
 
 There is talk of a generational shift in the Congress, once Rahul Gandhi takes over as party president. 
  I am not aware of the date of his ascension. We have no information on what changes he will bring about.He is already vice-president of the party, working at the helm of affairs. If he becomes president, he will just have more responsibility.  
 
 How do you see the situation in Gujarat, where dalits are attempting suicide and protesting after being humiliated for skinning dead cows? 
  Skinning of dead animals for leather is something that has been there from very long. A lot of people are dependent on it for livelihood. Why obstruct that?  
  Those are dead animals. These people did not kill them. If there is some use from them, why shouldn't it be allowed? The only intention of the BJP and its sister organisations in creating such incidents is polarisation of votes for upcoming elections.Whether it is the home state of the PM or not, this is what the BJP does.  
 
 Has the Arunachal Pradesh situation helped change the image of Congress as weak? 
  It is a setback for the central government. But the Congress is not weak just because we lost an elec tion. What happened in 1977 and 1978? Next ele ction, Congress will come back. Modi's government won't. If there is a third front, then Nitish Kumar may come into play. It is impossible to wipe out the Congress. Congress is the only party which is an alternative to BJP. Only Congress has a base in all states.  
 
 You have attacked the BJP for demanding and getting the resignation of minister KJ George, who is close to you. 
  Bandaru Dattatreya is also charged under Section 306 of the IPC, just like George. There is an FIR filed against Smriti Irani. There are 13 ministers in the Modi government who are facing criminal charges.Uma Bharti is facing three murder cases, rioting... why are they continuing in government? Why does the BJP have a different yardstick for the centre and for Karnataka? Are democratic values different? An arrest warrant was issued against (BS) Yeddyurappa, there are many FIRs against him, but he is their state president.

What controversies? Seriously? Rohith Vemula suicide or JNU? People of India are way to smart to be misled by bullshit. Mahagathbandhan or not. 

Congress has a complete leadership crisis. There are only post 65 crowd alive there, and completely out of touch with reality of India. The big strategic problem that other parties have is that they have unconsciously ceded the WHOLE development plank to BJP and have just retained the caste related threads. 

BJP has a Hindu card to play against the caste thread in a few places, but large number of seats will be with urban and suburban India (say give or take top 300 towns in India) and that will provide BJP what it needs. Given how it has started to penetrate deeply into Maharashtra, Assam and JK - they will keep capturing newer markets. The GDP growth of their states is going to be much better than the non BJP states, and every Jaunpur-Allahbad taxi wala who is in Mumbai and Gujarat will know what they are missing. These things do not matter much in 2-3 years, but mean a LOT in a 10-20 year time period. BJP will win Karnataka slowly and keep chipping away at other smaller states. 

keep in mind what people thought was the downside when Modi came into power. Even educated people thought that he would unleash Hinduism on the whole country and muslim blood will be freely flowing at the slightest provocation, he would embarrass India on the world stage and he would not be able to get much done in parliament. We have had no riots, Pakistan cannot fuck with us any more, India has climbed on the center stage globally, and he is chipping away at parliamentary issues - GST is coming soon enough.

Modi is in an extremely comfortable position, politically.",2016-07-22 11:31:56

It fascinates me personally  , as I view this from the US, where socialism is considered the worst accusation (even worse than corruption) against a politician. 

Modi has taken many actions to further continue the delinking process, to put as much of socialism behind as possible. Yet all this happens against a backdrop of the fact that India is home to one-third of that saddest category of humans - called the ""extreme poor"".  Move too fast, and disaster could result for those and many others that eat nothing but dust. Move too slowly, and the other extreme, the middle and upper middle class will clamor for more.

 Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the state government over a petition filed by the principal of Government Nursing College located on Civil Hospital campus. In the petition, the principal has accused a senior faculty member, Harisinh Chaudhary, of sexual harassment. Chaudhary was posted in the college recently. The principal has sought the high court's intervention to stop Chaudhary's alleged habit of sexually harassing staff members and nursing students as no action had been taken by the authorities. She has demanded setting up of a committee under the Sexual Harassment of Women (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, to inquire into various allegations levelled in different places against Chaudhary and others.

The petitioner has claimed that when Chaudhary was appointed at the nursing college in Vadodara, many students had complained against him for sexual harassment but the department had taken no action. When the students complained before then chief minister Narendra Modi, an inquiry was ordered.

However, since Chaudhary is a tribal and there is a strong tribal lobby in the department and in the secretariat, no inquiry was initiated against him. She has alleged that even even speaker Ganpat Vasava had protected. 

""Reservation has created caste lobbies in the corridors of the secretariat and the powerful lobby of Scheduled Tribes unites when one of them is being proceeded against,"" the principal has said in her petition.

The petitioner has claimed that there are 15 cases pending against Chaudhary for departmental proceedings but nothing had happened to him. She has demanded action against all those officials who have not acted against Chaudhary.

The petitioner has also stated that she too is facing allegations and is ready to face any departmental proceedings. She has also sought HC's protection against possible victimization by the health and family welfare department.

The state government, however, denied the allegations. The government advocate submitted that, at the most, Chaudhary and his associates may have passed colourful remarks. The petitioner's advocate Anand Yagnik vehemently argued that making such remarks also amounts to sexual harassment.

ISLAMABAD: BACKGROUND

Pakistan wants UNHRC to send fact-finding team to KashmirPakistan's foreign affairs adviser to prime minister Sartaj Aziz. (AP photo)HighlightsPakistan has approached the UN Human Rights Council to send a fact-finding team to KashmirPak wants UNHRC to investigate the alleged human rights violations and recent killings of innocent peopleAziz repeated the words of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that Kashmir is not India's internal matterISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday said it has approached the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to send a fact-finding team to Kashmir to investigate the alleged human rights violations and recent killings of innocent people.""We have requested UNHRC to send a fact-finding mission to Kashmir (in India) and probe recent killings of innocent Kashmiris,"" the Prime Minister's Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz said.

Briefing journalists at the Foreign Office here, he urged the international community to take notice of the situation in Kashmir and extend its support to the Kashmiri people.

Aziz repeated the words of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that Kashmir is not India's internal matter.

""Kashmir is not India's internal matter because it is recognised under the United Nations,"" he said and accused India of using ""state-sponsored terrorism to justify illegal occupation over Kashmir"".

""India will not be able to legitimise its occupation,"" he said.

To a question as to why Sharif is not using his 'personal relations' with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to defuse tension in Kashmir, Aziz said: ""PM Sharif's personal ties with Modi are not state ties"".

He further said: ""It does not matter how many times Modi speaks to Sharif on phone in a day what matters is whether the former talks to the latter about the Kashmir issue.""

When asked if Pakistan is considering severing diplomatic tie with India over the Kashmir violence, Aziz said: ""Severing ties with India over the issue is no solution to the issue of Kashmir.""

The adviser declared that Pakistan ""fully backs"" All Parties Hurriyet Conference (APHC) leader Syed Ali Geelani's four-point formula on Kashmir.

Aziz also said that India wants to do point scoring on the issue of filing an application in a local Indian court for registration of case against Prime Minister Sharif.

""Filing an application by an Indian organisation against PM Nawaz Sharif (for declaring Hizbul commander Burhan Wani and observing black day in this connection) in an Indian court is a point-scoring from the Indian government,"" he said.

A case has been filed in a court in Ambala, India by the Anti-Terrorist Front against Sharif accusing him of hatching a conspiracy to provoke riots in Jammu and Kashmir.

The Prime Minister directed all the relevant departments to highlight the Kashmir issue at international fora.

Pakistan fanning discontent in Kashmir: India

India on Thursday said Pakistan is not only pushing in terrorists but also fanning discontent within the Kashmir valley by providing support to terrorist outfits.Asserting that Wani issue was internal to India, external affairs ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said Pakistan has 

no locus standi

 in the matter and asked it to refrain from interfering in it.Asked if there was a shift in Pakistan strategy vis-a-vis Kashmir where one sees increase in number of 'home-grown militants', he said, ""It is part of the continued strategy of Pakistan of not only infiltrating terrorists from across the border but also fanning discontent within the valley by providing various support to terrorist outfits.""

Terming Pakistan's continued effort to internationalise the Kashmir issue as ""a self-serving exercise towards narrow political end"", Swarup said the world has a clear view about which country in the region covets the territory of others, uses terrorism as state policy, provides sanctuary to UN-designated terrorists and terror groups and violates human rights.

""Terrorism is terrorism and no amount of justification on part of Pakistan is going to change that,"" he said.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif + said on Friday after his party PML-N swept PoK's legislative assembly elections.Addressing a public gathering in Muzaffarabad, Sharif said, ""We are waiting for the day Kashmir becomes (part of) Pakistan.""

In his first public address following his return from London after an open-heart surgery in May, Sharif urged Kashmiris ""not to forget those in Kashmir who are sacrificing their lives for their movement for freedom"".

""Their movement for freedom cannot be stopped and it will be successful. You are aware of how they are being beaten and killed. All our prayers are with them and we are waiting for the day Kashmir becomes (part of) Pakistan,"" Sharif was quoted as saying by Dawn News.

PML-N is set to form the next government in PoK as the unofficial results of the election for 41 direct seats of the legislative assembly on Thursday suggested a landslide victory for the party.

""I saw the election results at night and thought that if our victory is evident, I will travel to Muzaffarabad to congratulate my brothers and sisters. I was told to go tomorrow or day after tomorrow, but said I can't wait, I want to go tonight,"" he said.

Sharif thanked the people of PoK for their support, conveying his gratitude to the crowd for their prayers for his recovery.

He slammed those engaging in ""negative politics"" against the PML-N and congratulated the people for voting for the party.

Prime Minister Sharif's party emerged victorious in the assembly elections held on Thursday in which a total of 26 political parties and 423 candidates took part.

Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which won the last polls, could only manage to win two seats while cricketer-turned- politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf (PTI) also got as many with the Muslim Conference bagging three.



It was expected that there would be a stiff competition between the three mainstream parties — Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), PPP and Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf but the PML-N routed them, stunning political pundits.

A total of 2.674 million Pakistan's Kashmiris exercised their right to franchise on Thursday to elect members for the PoK legislative assembly, which will be the ninth since the parliamentary form of government was introduced there in 1975.

While the region is spread over 14,245 square kilometres, the polling process is not restricted to this area and instead stretches to entire Pakistan because members for 12 out of the 41 directly elected seats are elected by 438,884 voters living in various parts of the country.

Some 12 are reserved for refugees from Kashmir in Pakistan.

Modi may have some great qualities like honesty, discipline etc, but the fact that he faces challenges is no reason to throw mud at India's past leaders.

3) Govt increased allocation to MNREGA by 500 crore whereas UPA reduced allocation in their last few years.    

4) And Modiji has been announcing new Atal schemes like there is no tomorrow. Atal Pension, Atal Insurance, Atal whatever. All these are welfare schemes and a big government which wants to be in everything. Modiji also has plans for socialised healthcare and social security.

5) In the last 2 years, Modiji has increased Service Tax multiple times. He has increased excise duty on petrol by around 10 Rs. 

6) Govt now more ministries than UPA had.    

7) Govt is now planning to grade artists.    

8) Modiji expanded the scope of Land Snatching.   

9) Starting new PSU bank to complement the 27 existing PSU banks.

114,"Very unlikely. Usually it's a tender process. One company winning it for fifteen years in a row raises lot of questions.  

I said that because I know of similar stories. 

A friend of mine got a contract from a particular state electricity board (SEB) for a specific thing (double digit crore contract) for seven years in a row. Eighth year the issue was raised in the state assembly and after that SEB guys (who were getting their cut every year) regretfully told him that he won't get it next year. All his investment went down under and close to hundred jobs were at risk. He though didn't fret about the investment as in seven years he had made enough to last for a lifetime. As for the employees they got the job with the next guy who got the contract. That's how things work. 

I am not defending Modi or government. I am sure the bribes are now getting paid to other people instead of the local university guys and that's why the contract moved. 

I know of many stories like my friend. 

Only exceptions could be for national level contracts. For example (till few years back, don't know the current situation) government offices and banks were allowed to buy Godrej furniture across the country without tendering. So a Godrej dealer in let's say Jabalpur will keep getting the contract year after year. Probably Godrej used to pay off at the highest level.

118,"&gt;Burning a living person just because her husband died.

Sati was typically voluntary and seen as a mercy by the Hindu widow herself, alternative to either starvation, or sex slavery as recommended by Islamic martial law when the invading army was muslim and the husband died in defense. To be contrasted with European practice of woman burning, which was officially sanctioned, always involuntary, and for completely fantastic justification.

&gt;Laws against the burning of women on her husband's funeral pyre. 

Not only did the British fail to extinguish the practice over the course of a century, but incidence of Sati were exacerbated by the British due to severe desperation resulting from regular artificial famines. The British forced extraction of Indian produce with a priority on their trade interests to the point of refusing famine relief, and acquired family-owned subsistence farms for commercial plantations that robbed Indian farmers of property rights over their family's land and relegated them to perpetual indentured servitude (also known as slavery). As it turns out, desperate and chronic poverty is not conducive to social development. The British used legislation against sati as a propaganda tool for their narrative of being a civilizing influence; it would have at least been helpful if it was had worked at all by independence. 

&gt;Modi would have mixed feelings about (child marriage).

source?

&gt;Introduction of modern communication, transport &amp; infrastructure.

One century of subjugation and we have a railway to show for it; I think even the mongoloids in government today will give them a run for their money at that level of incompetence. The vast majority of all the infrastructure and systems accessible to the public in India today have been constructed post-independence. There was extremely little the typical Indian had access to prior to that; the large majority of Indians were subsistence farmers.

&gt;Unification of a fractured country. Indians owe the very existence of their country to the British rule. Otherwise you'd have separate sub-reddits for the kingdoms of Hyderabad, Bengal, Rajputana, the Mughal Provinces, Goa, and the Dravidian states.

Indians didn't have any national allegiance prior to the era of the British Raj. Nationalism in Europe was largely a product of the 1700s and Indians imported the idea of national consciousness in the 1800s. If there wasn't at some point voluntary unification between some states where princes voluntarily abdicated as there was when the British left, we'd have eventually to develop an institutional framework akin to the EU for cooperation between Indian states with distinct governments.

I think a federation is generally superior when it comes to organization and collaborating to share resources for a developing part of the world as India; even without this, it's difficult to imagine how having enjoyed free competition, trade, and sovereign rule one's over labor and resources for an extra century wouldn't have left Indians better off then and now. It would be preferable to have Indians work on unity at their own pace, just as Europe has. 

&gt;Administrative reforms such as census, ASI, GSI, IAS, IPS, etc.

I'm not familiar with the particulars, but I doubt that would matter. I don't see any reason to believe that adopting a bureaucracy should be inherently different for the physical presence of the British in the subcontinent. Someone has yet to explain to me how open competition between states, free exchange of ideas, sovereign control over one's own resources and mere self-interest are not superior for exchange of ideas and technology.

&gt;Laws against female infanticide.
&gt;Encouraging the remarriage of widows, enacting legislation towards it.
&gt;Laws against child marriage.

Too bad they didn't see fit to do without the homophobia.

Nepal is a South Asian country that maintained its independence and has voluntarily adopted modern legal system, with all the trimmings, legislation against infanticide nonwithstanding. Pakistan was colonized but exists as a proto-theocracy, has regressed from British standards if anything. India was expected to transform into a Brahmanocracy, whereas legislation for institutional abolishment of caste discrimination only followed independence. I don't see any reason to assume Indians in general would be better or worse off with respect to governance. If we assume that in the absence of colonial rule, there would be no history worth mentioning at all in the subcontinent, then you'd probably be correct; but then we would be ignoring opportunity cost.

Gleaning English from the British was legitimately useful since it's spoken everywhere

Probably the most worthwhile product of colonial rule is ironically that which colonial apologists are least likely to mention; that what was one of the largest economies in the world prior to the colonial era, was able to fuel the beginnings of the second wave of industrialization in Europe. That at least Europe was able to gain from the almost total economic and social stagnation in the subcontinent. Of course, would involve giving Indians credit for their labor and handicraft, which would be difficult given how strongly we have been despised for the fact of our existence by them. *""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes.""* -Winston Churchill on how to civilize rebellious Indians.",2016-07-23 15:09:02

&gt; * Picture by Naeem Ansari Gorakhpur, July 22: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today described how he ran even while climbing stairs, using it as a metaphor for his speedy delivery of development, and sought votes for the BJP in next year's Assembly polls as he addressed a rally in Gorakhpur.

&gt; * I said, 'Brothers, this is Modi.

&gt;* On Wednesday, Congress chief whip Jyotiraditya Scindia attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his silence on the latest crisis in Kashmir.

&gt;* Government managers like information and broadcasting minister Venkaiah Naidu countered these allegations, saying the PM is not supposed to give a running commentary.

&gt;* It may be an irony that during the UPA era, the BJP constantly accused the then PM Manmohan Singh of keeping silent even as allegations of scams broke one after another.

&gt;* 1) July 2016: Kashmir turned into a volatile battleground between security forces and locals after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani .

&gt;* 4) October 2015: The lynching of a Muslim man, Mohammad Ikhlaq, in Dadri over allegations that he had consumed beef, erupted into a major row.

The reality is that NO country in the history of mankind has ever developed without having shitting on some portion of society. Ever wondered why America is able to build highways and other infrastructure without Native Americans protesting over it? Native Americans, after all, are the original owners of most of the land. The reason is simply because the Americans killed off most Native Americans, either through war, or starvation by forcing them to live in reservations. 

Yet today, the West constantly puts a spotlight on developing countries like India, highlighting the ""unfairness"", the ""intolerance"", etc., all under the guise of ""human rights"" or  ""religious freedom"".

New Delhi: 
  Judith D'Souza, an Indian woman kidnapped last month from Kabul in Afghanistan, has landed in India after being rescued.
""I am happy to inform you that Judith D'Souza has been rescued,"" Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted this morning.


40-year-old Judith, who works for Agha Khan Foundation - an international NGO - as a senior technical adviser, was kidnapped on June 9 by suspected terrorists right outside her office in the heart of Kabul. Kolkata-based Judith was in Kabul for over a year on her second stint in the Afghan capital.

 Ms Swaraj said that Judith is safe and will reach Delhi this evening.

""We are thankful to the Indian government for the rescue of our sister. We are now waiting for her to be back home. We would request the media to respect our privacy,"" Judith's sister Agnes told PTI.


Judith's family had last month written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging his intervention in ensuring that she is reunited with them.


PM Modi had requested Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to expedite efforts to secure Judith's release.


Thanking Ms Swaraj for her ""assurances"", Judith's brother Jerome D'Souza had tweeted yesterday:

141,"Yes and no. 

A Chinese journalist that calls for Xi Jinping to be fired would likely be censored, where as an Indian journalist that calls for Modi to be fired would not. That is correct. 

On the other hand, a Chinese journalist that writes about pollution in a Chinese village is more likely to get more protection from local thugs and politicians than an Indian journalist.

Why?  

The reason is that function of the media in China is different from that in India. In China, most media (Xinhua, et. al.) are owned by the state, which has an interest in uncovering incompetence in local provinces, cities, and villages. So the Chinese media is pretty free to report on incompetent local authorities, e.g. starving farmers, shitty factories, pollution, whatever, because the central government wants this feedback to know which officials are doing well, and which are not. Since the media reports directly to Beijing, the reporters are less afraid of local politicians or business leaders. A news organization like Xinhua is not going to be intimidated by any big business, military, or local government.  In other words, all the bad stuff that occurs in anywhere in China, except Beijing, is pretty much fair game for Chinese journalists.

NEW DELHI: Delhi police on Sunday arrested Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan on charges of threatening a woman with rape and murder.Police said Khan is also accused of attempting to run over the woman with his car. 

The woman alleged that Khan instructed a young man to threaten her with rape and murder for 'politicising"" the issue of power cuts in the capital.

Several AAP members, including Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, allege that the charges against Khan are trumped up, and that the BJP is behind the episode.

&gt;Just in - Modi ji arrests one more AAP MLA.— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) [July 24, 2016](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/757069851227750400)


Following the arrest on Sunday, the AAP MLA's supporters gathered outside the Jamia Nagar police station to protest Amanatullah's arrest. 

Last week, a woman alleged that on July 9, when she went to Khan's residence to discuss power cuts, a young man made the threat after he was instructed to do so by Khan. She added that while the MLA didn't meet her. While she was leaving Khan's residence, the young man came out of the house and threatened that she would be killed if she didn't stop politicizing the issue of power cuts.

The woman filed an FIR about the incident on July 9. Police officers said the woman had recorded her statement under section 164 of CrPC, after which the FIR was registered. She also gave the police commissioner a written complaint on July 10.

Khan claimed that the woman had made a ""false"" statement before the magistrate that he had tried to crush her with his car. The MLA said he was out of Delhi and in Meerut on July 9 and 10. He alleged that the BJP had a role in the whole episode. AAP's Delhi unit secretary Saurabh Bharadwaj also claimed that this was yet another case of the Centre using the police against his party's MLAs.

At a press conference on Saturday , AAP played a video in which the woman is purportedly involved in a conversation with a person during which she is heard saying that the SHO of the Jamia Nagar police station asked her to add allegations of the rape and murder threat to the FIR.

153,"Dalit unrest: Does PM Modi speak only when he detects an electoral opportunity in human misery?

---

&gt;* When asked, a visibly agitated GVL Narasimha Rao, told Times Now that Modi was a PRIME MINISTER and not a Prime Speaker. Rao, a regular face on Indian TV to talk about almost anything and everything regardless of whether he necessarily possesses expertise on the subject, indirectly implied that Modi by virtue of being the prime minister had assumed the status of the mighty Feudal Lord of India, who alone could decide the issues and timings for his comments.

&gt;* In other words, what we learnt from Rao was that while Modi could be nimble-footed in sharing the grief of election-bound Bengalis in Kolkataeven when he wason a foreign tour in Belgium, he should simply not be bothered to comment either when an innocent Muslim is being lynched by his supporters in Dadri or his home state is facing unprecedented unrest.

&gt;* Its perhaps this headline grabbing initiative that sees him spend Diwali with Kashmir ahead of elections only to remain silent in the midst of dozens of deaths in the valley now that his party has been voted to power with the help of the PDP.

&gt;* Its this alleged political opportunism that makes him utterly vocal on a flyover tragedy of Kolkata just ahead of elections but the prime minister seems to mysteriously lose his voice when dozens are killed following days of law and order breakdown in Haryana.

&gt;* We will know in few months time if the prime minister is able to wield his personal charisma in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Punjab to replicate the successes of 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

  Kumar, a former Himachal Pradesh chief minister who had earlier joined seniors like L K Advani in attacking the party leadership, said India had achieved high growth and won global recognition under Modi but ignoring the problem of rising population will endanger that.  
 
  ""There has already been much delay in solving this problem and any more delay will be deadly. There is no other option but to control population to deal with all these problems. The country has reposed a lot of faith in you.  
 
  ""It seems to me that the history wants you to do this difficult but fundamental work of national importance. I humbly urge you to take an initiative to call a meeting of all political parties to evolve a consensus over national population policy,"" the Lok Sabha member said in a letter to Modi.  
 
  Citing figures of high unemployment, pollution, hunger and slums, he said these challenges could be tackled only by controlling population.  
 
  ""Some problems of the country have acquired dangerous proportions. Increasing population is at the root of maximum problems. Every year India's population is increasing by the size of two countries. There has already been much delay in solving this problem and any more delay will be deadly.  
 
  ""There is no other option but to control population to deal with all these problems. We will start benefiting from the decision in some years but the biggest benefit will be that the coming generations will not hold us responsible for not doing the national duty due to vote bank politics,"" he said.  
 
  The biggest worry, he said, is that the nation's politics has completely shut its eyes to this root problem in a way similar to a pigeon closing its eyes before a cat.  
 
  Agenda and manifesto of no political party mentions this dangerous problem, he said, noting that the population has increased to 127 crore from 35 crore since independence.  
 
  The 81-year-old leader said BJP received a historic mandate in the last Lok Sabha elections and the country put its trust in Modi.  
 
  ""I think the fundamental problems of this country can be resolved under your leadership only,"" he said.  
 
  Besides thousands of people applying for a few vacancies, 11 out of 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India and 27 crore out of 82 crore hungry people in the world reside here, he said, adding that over 3 lakh farmers had committed suicide.

&gt; * In general, the special category states get a higher share of central grants, and Jammu and Kashmir being one of them will also get such treatment, Tapas Sen, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), and a long-time researcher on state finances, told The Hindu.

177,"Suresh Prabhu to start work on new India-Bangladesh railway project on July 31

---

&gt;* AGARTALA: Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu will lay the foundation stone for a new India-Bangladesh railway project and flag-off the Agartala to New Delhi passenger train service on July 31, a Tripura minister said here on Saturday.Tripura Transport Minister Manik Dey, giving the information, said the India-Bangladesh train would run from Agartala (India) to Akhaura (Bangladesh).

&gt;* The Agartala-New Delhi passenger train service will run on the newly-laid broad gauge line, he said.

&gt;* ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi might flag off New Delhi-Agartala passenger train service on the same day from the national capital,"" Dey told.Three Tripura Members of Parliament - Jitendra Chowdhury, Sankar Prasad Datta (Lok Sabha) and Jharna Das Baidya (Rajya Sabha) - on Friday met Prabhu in New Delhi and discussed the India-Bangladesh railway project and Agartala-New Delhi passenger train services.The Prime Minister, who attended the plenary session of the North Eastern Council (NEC) in Shillong in May, was scheduled to inaugurate both through remote control.

&gt;* However, the programme was deferred as the arterial railway line was disrupted due to heavy rain and landslides in Dima Hasao district in south Assam.The Rs 968 crore Agartala-Akhaura railway project was finalised in January 2010 when Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during her visit to New Delhi.Following the Tripura government's persistent persuasion and intervention by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the DoNER (Development of North Eastern Region) ministry has agreed to provide Rs 580 crore for the new railway project, Dey said.The DoNER ministry recently released Rs 150 crore to start the necessary work for acquisition of 67 acres of land for the project, he said.The minister said the 15 km (5 km on Indian side and 10 km on Bangladesh side) long Agartala-Akhaura railway project would provide a major boost to the development and economy of the north-eastern region of India and eastern Bangladesh.The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) has done the preliminary work for the project.India's External Affairs Ministry would provide the necessary funds for the Bangladesh portion of the Agartala to Akhaura rail project.

&gt;* The DoNER ministry's funds would be spent for the Indian portion of the project, the minister said.The 1,650-km distance between Agartala and Kolkata would be reduced to only 550 km once the new rail track is linked through Bangladesh.Currently, India and Bangladesh have four rail links with West Bengal.The railway line from Guwahati passes through Lumding in Nagaon district in central Assam and southern Assam connecting land-locked Agartala, parts of Manipur and Mizoram with the rest of India.The Guwahati-Silchar railway line is the lifeline for southern Assam comprising four districts - Cachar, Karimganj, Hailakandi, Dima Hasao, known as Barak Valley and the mountainous states of Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur.These states are heavily dependent on this railway line for supply of foodgrains, fertilisers, petroleum products, construction material and other commodities besides ferrying passengers.

  ""I am a buyer (of India),"" said Staley. ""Economic prospects are very favourable. The government is working very hard to change laws so that India restructures itself to provide economic growth. India is not a developing country dependent on commodities almost uniquely. In fact, it's one of the countries which benefits when commodities get cheaper. That I think is a very positive sign.""  
 
  Staley took over as Barclays CEO in December last year and has since announced a broad restructuring programme that involves shrinking operations in Asia, including India, where it shut the equities business. But its back-office operation in the country is substantial, employing more than 16,000. Barclays plans to expand this, the CEO said.  
 
  ""We have great intellectual capital in our bank in India. One-third of the executive committee of Barclays are now from India,"" Staley said. ""We will be done (selling down) by 2017 and we now need to focus on growth and helping to fund growth in places like India and elsewhere... We will not change the locations or the markets that Barclays operates in.""  
 
  The bank is gearing up for future growth in the country.  
 
  ""It was a very relevant or important decision that we made that we want to stay committed as an investment and corporate bank to India and we will,"" he said. ""We hope to grow that business in the future.""

192,Modi wants to be the Erdogan . But India isn't Turkey man ,2016-07-25 15:05:32
193,"Yes. AAP is being targeted, but the thing is that..due to various reasons (especially AK's Victim complex) ... a very strong and strict line is drawn between Modi and AK, often by AK himself. ..to the extent that those who support one cannot support the other. 

The reasons for this are far and many, right from AK's change of Target from Congress to BJP as well as BJP's  (and Modi = BJP today) relentless focus on spoiling AAP's name. 

So, with such strict demarcations, people end up taking sides. And when they take up sides, they don't really care what the other side is doing/is right etc. 

That is what is happening here. AK **himself** wanted to be Modi's enemy no. 1. And he got to be that. 

So, Modi's supporters have no issues in a bit of vendetta politics, and AK's supporters see malice in everything that Modi does and dragging him into everything bad that happens in this country, even if it not related to BJP/Modi. And neither party sees anything wrong. 

As you can guess from my reply, I don't really give a rat's hat for things like ""ethics"" and ""values"" when it comes to politicians. Politics is as much as about saving your ass, as it is about doing something good. Trying to overnight expect all Politicians like some squeaky clean clerks who just want to work hard from 9-5 is stupidity. 

So, I feel it is not necessarily a bad thing. We need a strong face to counter Modi. And if all these, enables AK to become a stronger face, and If AK can be that face in 2019/2024, sure. why not.

Kerala and TN are irrelevant since the parties that won there are not part of the ruling coalition. 5 from AP is also pretty fair given AP's TDP is an ally of a party that holds an outright majority on its own right.

205,"#Nepal PM KP Oli resigns before trust vote, his fall good news for India
___

&gt;[READ MORE ON &amp;#xBB; PM KP Oli | Nepal | India | CongressNepal's Prime Minister KP Oli resigns NEW DELHI: As Nepal moved on Sunday](http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-53373389,width-310,resizemode-4/nepals-prime-minister-kp-oli-resigns.jpg)
___

  NEW DELHI: As [Nepal](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nepal) moved on Sunday to finally dislodge prime minister KP Oli , it was a positive development so far as [India](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India) is concerned. Faced with a no-confidence motion, Oli resigned on Sunday, paving the way for a Prachanda-led Maoist-Nepali [Congress](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress) government in Kathmandu. While the event was a stinging indictment of Oli's domestic and foreign policies, it's also a blow for China and its interventions in Nepal.  
 
  There was some debate in Kathmandu about the steps after the dissolution of the Oli government, and how the president, Bidhya Bhandari would interpret Article 305 of the Nepal constitution on how another government would be formed. But NC leader and former PM, Sher Bahadur Deuba stressed that only the parliament had the power to decide on the next government. Oli tried hard to get the president to declare he could continue as caretaker prime minister. But Nepal watchers here say Oli's efforts to stay on would prove costly not only for his party but for Nepal. The no-trust motion in the 598-member Constituent Assembly was backed by 183 NC parliamentarians, 70 from CPN-MC and three from CPN-United. The three parties have a combined strength of 292 in Parliament.  
 
  ""I have decided to open the road to elect a new prime minister in this parliament and presented my resignation to the president,"" Oli said, bringing to an end a 287-day government marked by inaction, and an overt-anti-Indian sentiment.  
 
  Oli's erosion of support can be traced to several things -- first, the blatant discrimination his government showed to the Madhesis (who form 51 per cent of the population) which resulted in months of protests and a blockades on the India-Nepal border; second, his disinterest or inability to deliver on reconstruction and rehabilitation post 2015 earthquake, and third, his play on ultra-nationalism, by overtly courting China in an attempt to build an anti-India state. Over six months after Oli's government greeted trucks bringing in petroleum supplies from the China border, it has become clear there is no real agreement on either energy supplies from China or transit through Tianjin, which is yet to be available to Nepal. The details of Nepal-China partnership is yet to acquire discernible contours, despite Oli's protestations.  
 
  While India has been criticized for the blockade in 2015, in hindsight the blockade served a very important purpose. It drove home the message India has made from the beginning that Nepal's constitution and government needed to be more inclusive and less discriminatory. PM Narendra Modi used the phrase ""samaaveshi samvidhan"" repeatedly with the Nepalese leadership- but it needed the blunt instrument of the blockade to drive that point home. India feared Terai regions of Nepal would turn ugly in the coming months and years if the shortcomings of the constitution were not addressed. In many different ways, India's approach to Nepal has been vindicated. With Prachanda likely to become the next PM, India will extend full support to the new government, restoring a strategic relationship that had gone off the rails. This was a response to Oli's statement, ""Nepal is being developed as a laboratory and foreign elements are conspiring not to implement the constitution.""  
 
  In the wake of the crisis, India put out the red carpet for Oli to signal India's view that the Nepal constitution is actually a positive document. ""There are shortcomings that should be addressed, but Nepal has made steady progress towards democracy,"" said official sources. Although the Nepal government delivered on two promises to the Madhesis, it still has to work on three others- citizenship, province delimitation (""seemankan"") and Madhesi representation in the upper house of Nepal parliament. That will be among the first items on the agenda of the next government, apart from clearing a national budget.  
 
  China has expended unusual amounts of political and diplomatic capital to build an anti-India phalanx in Nepal politics, by trying to stitch the Left parties together. In May, they succeeded in getting Prachanda to change his mind. But ground level politics was giving Prachanda very different feedback. In the past few weeks, Chinese officials have worked hard to save the fraying relations between Oli and his partners who had started to desert. The first to go was Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), leaving Kamal Thapa's royalist lot isolated. Bijay Gachchedar's MJAF(D) including Tharus and Madhesis also supported the no-trust vote, after throwing their lot with Oli in October 2015.  
 
  China has worked hard on India's neighbouring governments to build another anti-India front apart from Pakistan. But, as with Mahinda Rajapakse in Sri Lanka, they have failed to recognize political realities in Nepal. The growing anti-India sentiment being fanned in Nepal by the establishment, had become a problem for India. India will be looking to reverse that.

206,"#Consensus On Tax Reform GST Appears To Crumble, Congress Furious
___

&gt;[The Congress is angry and is threatening to withdraw the flexibility it had displayed on GST.New Delhi:&amp;#xA0; The Goods and Services Tax or GST Bill is in trouble yet again. One day before Finance&amp;hellip;](http://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-07/rajya-sabha_650x400_71468322363.jpg)
___

New Delhi: 
  The Goods and Services Tax or GST Bill is in trouble yet again. One day before Finance Minister Arun Jaitley meets his counterparts from all states to discuss amendments, parliament was abuzz that the thaw between the government and the Congress after nine months of frost is almost over.
The Congress today attacked the government for attempting consensus on GST and attacking Congress top leaders at the same time.


""Cooperation in the house for the interest of the country we are doing. But politically they are taking revenge,"" said senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge

The Congress is angry and is threatening to withdraw the flexibility it had displayed on GST. Just before the session it had held formal negotiations with the government to end their differences. That meeting was the first since November last year when Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yielded to an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Last week, the Congress, which is the single largest party in Rajya Sabha, agreed with the government to allocate five hours to discuss and pass GST. A step forward, though no date was fixed.
But the First Information Report or FIR filed by the Enforcement Directorate, which handles cases of money laundering, seems to have turned the clock back. The case pertains to a land allotted by former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda to the company that publishes the National Herald and had Congress president and vice president as directors.


The Congress strongly denies any financial wrong doing. It says the government is indulging in political vendetta.


In Rajya Sabha, the Congress disrupted proceedings over a private member bill for providing a special status to Andhra Pradesh after formation of the state of Telangana.


The development has created doubts in parliament among parties which have been supporting GST. A senior Janata Dal (United) leader said, ""What was the need to lodge an FIR at this time, this could have happened two weeks later. It has been done intentionally at the directions of the PMO.""


Tathagata Satpathy of the Biju Janata Dal said ""It seems the government is not interested in GST and is creating impediments.""


Anil Desai of the Shiv Sena, a member of the NDA government, echoed this sentiment. ""The Congress was coming around. Things were improving. Time duration for discussion was fixed. Why is the consensus exercise being subverted now?""


Praful Patel of the NCP, which has batted for the bill, claimed there is a link between the bill and the case against Mr Hooda and congress leaders. He said, ""The consensus exercise should not be disrupted.""


The Congress says the government may have been making the right noises about the GST bill but it doesn't want the GST bill now. Party leader Jairam Ramesh today said, ""We know there are serious differences in the government over the GST. The government is worried that it may trigger inflationary trends.""


BJP leaders admit that if GST is passed in near future and it rolls out by next year it may have twin impact. ""One the high rate of GST and the larger tax base it may engage could trigger price rise. At a time when crucial UP and Gujarat polls may be on,"" a senior BJP leader said.


There are apprehensions in the BJP that its loyal vote bank of traders may revolt against GST as it may bring greater accountability among those who do not pay taxes.


A senior NDA leader summed up the situation differently. He said, ""The bill may have a negative impact. Plus if passed with Congress help the BJP may lose the poll plank that the Congress is obstructing pro-reform measures.""


With 60 members, the Congress is the single largest party in the Rajya Sabha, whose members total 245. With the support of allies and a few regional parties that oppose the bill, it reckons the government cannot muster the two-thirds majority needed for a key amendment to enact the GST.


The government however denies the opposition charges. It says consultations with opposition and allies are on. And efforts are on to build a broad consensus on the bill. However, none of its leaders are ready to on record explain why each time the climate on the GST bill is improving, either government agencies make a move against the Gandhis, or the BJP sharpens its attack on the Congress' first family.

&gt;This was not a re-investigation like you say as no inquiry was ever conducted by the government.

You know, people shouldn't speak if they don't know the facts. In that sense you're beginning to sound like Kejriwal himself. Emulate him that much?

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Batla-House-encounter-NHRC-gives-clean-chit-to-Delhi-police-/articleshow/4807885.cms?

&gt;The NHRC, which had conducted inquiry in the case on the direction of the Delhi High Court, said in its report that there has been no violation of human rights by actions of police in which two alleged terrorists were gunned down on September 19, 2008. 

&gt;""We are clearly of the opinion that having regard to the material placed before us, it cannot be said that there has been any violation of human rights by action of police,"" the commission said in its 30-page report submitted in a sealed envelope to the high court. 

National Human Rights Commission is as much a government body as any other. It did investigate it. And found that there was no violation of human rights. Anything subsequent is a **re-investigation**. 

&gt; Also, since when does asking for investigation turn into a Muslim manifesto?

Ever since **appeasement politics** started in India. Different people date it back to different events and people. Some will say Nehru, some will say Rajiv. I say it's definitely been around since MMS gave the first rights over all natural resources to Muslims.",2016-07-26 13:57:37

By Mihir Sharma





  On July 26, 1991, [Manmohan Singh](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Manmohan-Singh) -- then [Finance Minister](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Finance-Minister), and later Prime Minister for 10 years -- rose in Parliament to deliver an address that would transform India. That speech, outlining the first [budget](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/budget) of a just-elected government under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, launched India's journey of economic reform, dismantling many decades-old socialist-style controls on the private sector.
  



  A quarter-century later, much has changed. India, once cruelly mocked for its ""Hindu rate of growth"" -- per capita GDP growth of just over 1 percent a year -- is now the fastest-growing large economy in the world. Its economic landscape has been altered completely; it's no longer the agrarian economy it was in 1991. For citizens who lived through the grey isolation of the decades before ""liberalization,"" the vibrant and globalized India of today looks and feels like a thoroughly different country.
  



QuickTake India's Aspirations


  Sadly, however, one thing hasn't changed since 1991: India continues to under-perform. It may be growing faster than its peers, but as central bank governor [Raghuram Rajan](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Raghuram-Rajan) has pointed out, that amounts to little more than being a ""one-eyed king"" in the land of the blind. Growing fast when the world is growing too, as [China](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/China) did for decades, is one thing. Growing slightly faster than anyone else when the world is in a slump is a totally different sort of achievement.
  



  India is capable of growing in double digits, but even today, it continues to set limits on its growth. No government since has fully committed to the reform process that Singh began. No Indian leader -- not even Singh during his tenure as Prime Minister -- has really tried to convey to Indian voters exactly why the economic freedom that seemed within grasp back then was important, and more of the same would transform their lives. Thus the reform process remains woefully incomplete.
  



  True, under successive governments since 1991, external trade was largely liberalized; moderate tax reform was undertaken; and some effective regulatory bodies were set up. Regardless of the political orientation of the party in power, some market-friendly reforms get carried out.
  



  But these reforms are all ""gradualist""-- a word popular in India to describe the plodding pace of its liberalization program. Every government has shied away from unshackling those areas of the economy that are considered politically ""sensitive.""
  



  For example, agriculture -- in spite of the sector's abysmal productivity in India -- remains largely untouched by change. Farmers still can't sell their land freely and the government tightly controls marketing of their produce. Factory owners still struggle to comply with dozens of byzantine rules, most of them holdovers from the socialist past. And India is on the cusp of a banking crisis thanks to poor lending by the state-controlled banks that no government has dared to privatize.
  



  The seeds of this failure were sown at the very beginning. While the reform process Singh rolled out in 1991 was a triumph in many ways -- it slashed industrial licensing rules, freeing up producers and consumers -- it didn't go far enough. Prime Minister Rao was a cagey career politician with no ideological affinity for free-market liberalism. His government began the liberalization process because it had no choice: A decade of overspending had caused India to confront a balance-of-payments crisis that pushed it close to the edge of default.
  



  Even as Singh diluted industrial licensing and reduced tariffs, then, Rao chose to pretend in public that nothing had really changed -- although he later tried, in the words of an official close to him at the time, to give his actions ""a retrospective coherence."" A couple of years after 1991, the economic pressure was off. Politics-as-usual returned and Rao slowed the reform program to a crawl.
  



  That pattern has repeated itself since. Most Indian politicians have imitated Rao's craven unwillingness to embrace the market, preferring to ""reform by stealth"" instead. Nor are the benefits of greater economic freedom and openness -- which has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in India -- explicitly spelled out. As a consequence, even as India's reforms have been successful by many measures, there are still few politicians who see electoral benefits to being a reformer. Even Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi), who some hoped would cut red tape everywhere, Thatcher-style, has turned out to be a cautious tinkerer, constantly mindful of imagined political costs.
  



  The costs to India of this embrace of gradualism are grave. The agenda of 1991 remains incomplete. Had genuine structural reform been undertaken then, Indian industry would have had the flexibility and dynamism needed to be competitive in today's world. Instead, the government continues to control and meddle in markets, causing India to become, paradoxically, a desperately poor, high-cost economy, struggling to employ the millions who join its workforce yearly.
  



  The big applause line in Manmohan Singh's 1991 budget speech was cribbed from Victor Hugo: ""No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come."" Sadly, if liberal economics was that idea, than the 25 years since suggest that Indian politics has been able to stop it quite effectively.

217,"Impotency, love affairs top reasons behind farmer suicides: Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh

---

&gt;* Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, however, does not rule out debt as one of the reasons behind the suicides of 5,650 farmers in 2014.

&gt;* Dowry, love affairs and impotency were among the reasons for the deaths of over 1,400 farmers in India this year, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said on Friday.

&gt;* According to the National Crime Records Bureau, causes of (farmer) suicides include family problems, illness, drugs... dowry, love affairs and impotency, he told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply to a question as to what caused the death of so many farmers in the country.

&gt;* The remarks on suicide by over 1,400 farmers in the last one year, by the governments own admission, are bound to provide fresh fodder to a belligerent opposition, which has been targeting the Narendra Modi government on the controversial land bill, dubbed as anti-farmer and anti-poor.

&gt;* A total of 5,650 farmers committed suicide in 2014, with the maximum deaths reported from Maharashtra, Telangana and Chhattisgarh, official data revealed.

&gt;* Before it is forgotten and they can deny it was never this way I wish to place on record a behavioural trait of Tamil Brahmin men that was prevalent when I was growing up in Madras.

&gt;* In the film some malnourished bare-chested Dalit boys are methodically beaten by cow-devouts in Gujarat as a swift punishment for skinning dead cows.

&gt;* The attackers had posted the film online as an advertisement of their valour though they claimed it was a warning to others who skinned the sacred Mother Cow.

&gt;* A few months ago, after the Dalit student, Rohith Vemula committed suicide, his death captured your interest, partly because his suicide note was in English and chiefly because activists interpreted his death successfully as a response to the politics of a Hindu cultural cartel, whose deity Modi is.

&gt;* A devious alignment of college reservations, grants, false heroes, and left evangelism push them towards liberal arts academics, lament literature and activism, which are luxury professions that are firmly in the control of the posh.

&gt;* Amid attempts by the government to resuscitate India's claims over the Kohinoor diamond, Britain has declared yet again that there is no legal ground for restitution in the case of the famed diamond which continues to evoke passions in India.The Narendra Modi government had told Supreme Court in April this year that the diamond could not be described as stolen as it was gifted to the British by Duleep Singh, the son of legendary Sikh king Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

  Amid attempts by the government to resuscitate India's claims over the [Kohinoor](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kohinoor) diamond, Britain has declared yet again that there is no legal ground for restitution in the case of the famed diamond which continues to evoke passions in India.
  



  The [Narendra Modi](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi) government had told Supreme Court in April this year that the diamond could not be described as stolen as it was gifted to the British by Duleep Singh, the son of legendary Sikh king Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Since then though, the government has sought to review its position keeping in mind the outrage in the country over what was seen as an attempt to relinquish India's claims over Kohinoor, which is currently on display at the Tower of London.
  



  ""It is the UK government's view that there aren't any legal ground for restitution of the diamond,"" said Alok Sharma, Britain's new minister for Asia and the Pacific who is currently on a 3-day visit to India.
  



  Sharma's visit is the first high-level engagement between the two countries since the new [Theresa May](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Theresa-May) government took over in UK, following Britain's exit from EU. During his visit, Sharma met MEA minister of state MJ Akbar, foreign secretary S Jaishankar and also road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari.
  



  Speaking in Parliament in May, culture minister Mahesh Sharma, in a complete turnaround, announced that his ministry was working with MEA for a satisfactory resolution of the issue with UK. This was after the government received criticism for ignoring the fact that Duleep Singh was just a kid when he was forced to part with the diamond by Lord Dalhousie. Mahesh Sharma met foreign minister Sushma Swaraj over the issue last week and discussed taking up the issue with Britain.
  



  Sharma, however, chose not to comment on Kingfisher chief Vijay Mallya who escaped to London fearing prosecution for unpaid loans to Indian banks worth Rs 9000 crore. UK authorities had earlier said that he couldn't be deported to India but that they were still willing to help India under mutual legal assistance or the extradition treaty.
  



  Sharma expresses satisfaction though that the 2 countries were working to make the extradition arrangement work. While the 2 countries have had an extradition treaty for the past 23 years, this has hardly resulted in the extradition of any high-profile offender. ''Both our governments need to understand each other better (on extradition),'' said Sharma, adding that there had been some progress in talks held in the recent past on extradition issues and that this had to be welcomed.
  



  Assuaging concerns in India over Brexit, Sharma said Britain still remained an ""incredibly outward-looking"" country and that it was not going to change.
  



  India was Sharma's first port of call after he took over as minister for Asia and the Pacific. ""I hope this will give a signal as to how seriously we take our relations with India,"" said Sharma. On recent developments in Kashmir, Sharma said Britain encouraged India and Pakistan to talk but added this was a matter for the 2 countries to come to a conclusion on.

Dr Kalam's grave in Rameswaram - a mere 5 km from his home -- stands amid a dirty field, where herds of cattle have made their home.


A makeshift structure has been built over the grave of the People's President. The sight is in stark contrast to the one on July 30, when various dignitaries, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was present to bid farewell to the Missile Man.


District authorities say the land for the memorial has been handed over to the Centre but the construction is yet to start.

Many say the Central Public Works Department, which should take up the construction, has not been alloted funds nor announced any design or time-frame.
Professor Jawaharullah, the lawmaker from Ramanathapuram, blamed the Central government. ""There's total apathy though they promised many at Kalam's funeral. They don't want Kalam's popularity to continue,"" he said.


For Dr Kalam's admirers, who consider a visit to the site akin to a pilgrimage, the sight is disappointing. Pilgrims who come to Rameswaram temple too, often pay a visit here.


""If they say they can't build a memorial for Kalam, we students would do it,"" said Arivalagan, an engineering student from Karaikudi.


Dr Anantha Krishnan M, Advisor, Kalam Foundation, said, ""You can't have a Bharat Ratna being left like this. If it was a politician, by now some structure would have come up.""


The Centre had turned down Dr Kalam's family's request to convert his Delhi home into a knowledge centre. All his belongings including his books were sent back.


Dr Kalam's elder brother pleaded for government intervention. ""Local and outstation pilgrims keep asking why the memorial has not been built. I request you to expedite the matter,"" said Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar.


The authorities refused to comment on the issue.


Dr Kalam, known as the father of India's missile programme, was President from 2002 to 2007. He died of cardiac arrest on July 27.

  NEW DELHI: Allowing multiple bids by corporates through joint ventures or group arms left much to be desired in regard to the competitiveness of the first-ever auction of coal mines held in 2014-15, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said while pointing out shortcomings in one of the Narendra [Modi government](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Modi-government)'s success stories.
  



  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the first two rounds of auctions, tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, also pointed out undervaluation to the tune of Rs 382 crore in the upfront payment that successful bidders make to the government.
  



  But the report is not all criticism. It has some words of praise too, describing the electronic auction as ""an improvement over the earlier system"" which ""attempted to incorporate the principles of objectivity, transparency and fairness in allocation of natural resources to private sector companies"".
  



  The government opted for e-auction after the Supreme Court scrapped allocation of 204 blocks in 2014 since they were not given without bidding. Altogether 29 blocks, categorised as producing and ready-to-produce, were auctioned in the first two rounds for captive use by power, steel and cement plants.
  



  ""In a scenario, where the standard tender document allowed participation of joint ventures and simultaneously limited the number of qualified bidders which could participate in the e-auction, audit could not draw an assurance that the potential level of competition was achieved in the stage-II bidding,"" the report said for 11 blocks.
  



  The report pointed out under-determination of the upfront payment in case of 15 mines, for which the [CAG](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cag) carried out a revised calculation of intrinsic value of the coal mines by calculating cost and revenue after considering all the deficiencies together in individual mines. According to this calculation, the under-determination works out to 41% of the total upfront amount of Rs 932.44 crore.
  



  In six non-regulated sector blocks, floor prices were under-determined by amounts ranging between Rs 4.70 per tonne and Rs 1264.44 per tonne.
  



  The CAG asked that if the bidding criteria were right, as the coal ministry claimed, why were these changed in the third round.
  



  From the third round onwards, the government said bids by group arms or JVs would be considered as one bid from the parent. This was done as to prevent cartelisation or price-rigging after bids for some blocks were found to be way different from the general trend in other similar blocks.

256,"Vote bank politics: Why Modi is silent on the attacks on Dalits in Gujarat

---

&gt;* Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis silence on the atrocities committed on Dalits in Una, Gujarat, illustrates vividly that he is still caught between a rock and a hard place.

&gt;* In the past, he also chose to remain mum on incendiary issues such as love jihad, ghar wapsi, and the public humiliation of Christians allegedly engaged in conversion.

&gt;* He did speak on the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, in September but it was so belated that it seemed to have been in response to the mounting public dismay or, even worse, as an afterthought.

&gt;* This is because these emotions have been engendered on account of the activities of Hindutva hotheads, who have embraced such divisive causes as love jihad, ghar wapsi, religious conversion and anti-cow slaughter.

&gt;* To speak about the anxieties of minorities is to also impliedly condemn a belligerent Hindutva, whose votaries would veer around to perceiving Modi as yet another prime minister who is trying to pamper or, to borrow from their lexicon, appease them.

257,"&gt;Gujarat Police gave him the “choice” of being implicated in the Godhra train burning, Haren Pandya murder and Akshardham terror, one of the men acquitted by the Supreme Court in the temple attack case alleged on Tuesday.

&gt;Mohammed Saleem was eventually sentenced to life under POTA for involvement in the Akshardham case.

&gt;On May 16, the day Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi won his historic mandate, the Supreme Court set Saleem and five others free, pulling up the Gujarat Police for framing innocent people, and blaming the then home minister — Modi — for “non-application of mind”. Four of the six men had already spent over 10 years in jail.

&gt;“I had been working in Saudi Arabia for 13 years, when they picked me up alleging there was a problem with my passport. &gt;They beat me brutally — I still have scars on my back, and I suffered a fracture in my foot. They asked me which case I wanted to be charged under — Akshardham, Haren Pandya or Godhra. I did not know what to say,” Saleem told a press conference addressed by five of the six men in Delhi.

&gt;Saleem’s daughter was born four months after his arrest. He picked her up in his arms for the first time only after his release — the child is 10 years old now.

&gt;The world of Abdul Qaiyum Muftisaab Mohammed Bhai alias Mufti Abdul Qaiyum has changed completely in the 11 years that he spent in jail. His father is dead, and his family no longer lives in their old home. His acquittal by the Supreme Court, Qaiyum said, was “mere release from prison; justice had been buried at every moment in these 11 years”.

&gt;Qaiyum said the main charge against him was that two letters recovered from the two fidayeen killed in the terror attack had been written by him. He was framed, Qaiyum alleged.

&gt;“For three days and nights, they made me copy a letter that they had given me. They (the police) would bring an expert each day to check whether I had copied it well. They would ask me to copy the turns and twists of the Urdu letters so that they looked exactly the same as in the letter. I was very afraid, and did what they told me to do,” he said. “Then they claimed in court that I had written the letters.”

&gt;Qaiyum said that in jail, he met the police officers who had framed him, and asked them why they had done so. “I met G L Singhal. Though they (police officers) were kept separately, we sometimes bumped into each other. I told him (Singhal): ‘Please tell me why did you do this to me.’ His young son had committed suicide, and that had made him feel what grief was. He had no answer.”

&gt;Arshad Madani, president of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind which organised the press conference, said, “I am willing to talk things over with anybody to ensure such things do not happen, but I fear that there is a real chance that this will actually happen more often.”

&gt;He said the Jamiat would approach the Supreme Court to seek punishment for the officers who had framed the men. “Supreme Court and judiciary is our last hope. The government and the media have been biased, and an atmosphere has been created in which every Muslim is seen as a terrorist,” Madani said

As India marks 25 years since the advent of economic reforms, it’s hard to escape the note of self-congratulation in much of the commentary the anniversary has inspired.


Indeed, by most measures there is much to celebrate. In terms of sheer numbers, only China has pulled more people out of extreme poverty faster than India. In 1991, more than four decades after Independence, nearly half of Indians lived on less than $1.90 a day, the World Bank’s current measure for extreme poverty. Today only about one in five slip below that benchmark.


By a rough calculation, that’s about 375 million fewer poor people than if the poverty rate had remained unchanged. The International Monetary Fund estimates that Indian per capita income more than tripled from about $550 in 1991 to $1,800 last year. As a result, an entire generation has grown up expecting upward mobility where their parents and grandparents accepted stagnation.


At the same time, India’s weight in the world has grown. In 1991, the world’s second most populous country accounted for a scant 3.6% of global gross domestic product. By 2015 this had nearly doubled to 7%. The World Bank estimates that India’s trade to GDP ratio nearly tripled from 16.7% in 1991 to 49% in 2014. Simply put, pre-reform India was economically insignificant and cut off from the world. Today it is an important player in the global economy, and as dependent on trade for its prosperity as China or Indonesia.


Or take foreign direct investment. In 1991, still tainted in the world’s eyes by its failed experiment with socialism, India attracted a meagre $240 million in inflows, less than a fourth of what Indonesia managed. Last year, more than $44 billion worth of FDI poured into India, about three times what Indonesia attracted, and a staggering 183 times more than the 1991 figure.


In short, the story of the past quarter century has been incontrovertibly positive for India. Not everyone has benefited equally, but life has improved faster for more people than at any time before. If these trends hold – and there’s no reason they shouldn’t – most readers of this newspaper will see extreme poverty abolished in their lifetimes. For previous generations of Indians this would have been hard to imagine, let alone take for granted.


But while the gains from economic reform are impossible to refute, the picture looks less rosy when you benchmark India not against its own dismal past, but against its peers in Asia.


For instance, the World Health Organization estimates that the average Indian lives 10 years longer today (68 years) than a quarter century ago. But he has yet to catch up with the average Indonesian (69 years), and continues to lag the average Chinese (76 years). Between 1991 and 2015 India slashed infant mortality by more than half – from 86 deaths to 38 deaths per 1,000 births. But that’s still nearly twice as high as infant mortality in Indonesia, and four times as high as in China.


Or take mobile phones, widely cited as a defining feature of India’s post-reform economic miracle. The International Telecommunications Union estimates that mobile subscriptions in India reached 79% last year, up from 62% just five years earlier. That sounds awfully impressive until you realise that in China the mobile penetration rate is 93% and in Indonesia it’s a stratospheric 132%.


In other words, India is much better off than it was a generation ago. But, purely in terms of prosperity and human development, it’s impossible to argue that the average Indian is better off than her peers in China and Indonesia.


In the warm glow of revisiting the 1991 reforms, former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao is enjoying a well-deserved comeback in the public imagination. In “Half-Lion”, political scientist Vinay Sitapati recalls the combination of guile and decisiveness that allowed Rao to dismantle much of Jawaharlal Nehru’s economic legacy while leading a party ostensibly committed to upholding it. Nehru’s folly – exacerbated greatly by Indira Gandhi – was to associate trade with exploitation, and to believe that wise bureaucrats could delegate resources better than markets. Rao effectively challenged both ideas.


Though Rao began his political career as a socialist himself, over time he grasped how badly the Indian experiment had soured, allowing countries that had lagged India in the 1950s to race ahead by the 1980s. Rao’s most consequential successor thus far, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, shared these twin insights: that independent India had erred in choosing state-led development, and that as a result it trailed much of East Asia.


What of Narendra Modi? There’s no question that the prime minister would like to see a strong and prosperous India. But we’re yet to see him make a full-throated case for further reforms such as rationalising labour laws and privatising state-owned firms in sectors of the economy better suited to the private sector.


India has come a long way by ending industrial licensing and embracing world trade. But in a democracy there’s only so far that the Rao model – reform by guile, not public persuasion – can go. Two years ago, many people hoped that Modi would apply his considerable gifts of communication to sell tough but necessary reforms to the public. Unfortunately, we’re still waiting.

262,"Rajdeep is a victim. Let me explain!

In the 90s and early 200s, Rajdeep was the main anchor of a relatively new channel, and had a much younger, more involved way of communicating. He did an Arnab Goswami on NDTV before Arnab did an Arnab to CNN IBN!

Sometimes I think his one TV interview with Modi ruined it for him. He wanted to interview him, and asked him about 2002. Leading questions. Modi was extremely prickly about 2002 at that period, and Rajdeep probably wangled the seat in the helicopter by acting like he would not ask uncomfortable questions. Modi remained unresponsive and glared outside the window instead.

Yes, it was embarrassing for Modi - IMO. But it damaged Sardesai too. The moment it was telecast, he belong to one side of the debate about Modi. Modi's enemies loved Modi's ridiculous behaviour - and Modi fans instantly marked Rajdeep as an enemy of their hero. After that, there was no returning for Rajdeep. He could not appeal to both groups even barely anymore. He now had to play his part. Short term gain, long term loss. In the end, a journalist can look biased, but once he has 'damaged' a 'hero', he is beyond tolerance.

Then  came Arnab - who stole Rajdeep's thunder by being even more noisy than him. His side was already picked for Rajdeep - and now he had to be noisy too. Despite hating Arnab's ways, Rajdeep had no option but to imitate Arnab. Sticking to a more sensible path would not work anyway - no one wanted a sensible (read not obviously biased) channel anymore.

Then came Twitter. Maintaining dignity on a medium like Twitter where nasty back and forth is routine is difficult - and it is not for the thin skinned. Sagarika was thinner skinned than him, and her ongoing battles were worse. She was a much disliked TV anchor, and the dislike towards her turned a lot of non-Modi supporters into Rajdeep haters.

And of course, the final straw was the fistfight. Rajdeep lost his cool when he was taunted - a sign that he had by then clearly picked a side too. A true journalist would have focused on recording and broadcasting the taunts (and secretly reveled in them) - and not lost control of himself. ",2016-07-27 18:44:03

New Delhi: 
  Startup India, the official Twitter handle of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project, has apologised to its over 39,000 followers after what it called ""unwarranted and irrelevant retweets"" led to a major controversy.
On Tuesday, the handle -  which usually tweets start-up news and retweets Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and other government officials - retweeted hate messages targeting journalists tagged as anti-national and a participant in a TV debate.


Shocked people shared screen screenshots asking who was handling the official Twitter account of a such a high-profile government of India initiative.

The Congress' Priyanka Chaturvedi said, ""Getting India started on a hate driven agenda? Is @startupindia handle managed by the troll chief of BJP? Shameful.""


Some people tweeted Ms Sitharaman whose ministry handles the massive Startup India initiative launched by PM Modi in January this year to encourage entrepreneurship in the country.


Startup India deleted the retweets and apologised on Wednesday. There was no word on how the handle had retweeted trolls.

&gt;[The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared changes in the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, dropping 1 per cent manufacturing tax and providing guarantee to compensate states for any revenue loss in the first&amp;hellip;](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/53420422.cms)
___



  NEW DELHI: The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared changes in the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, dropping 1 per cent manufacturing tax and providing guarantee to compensate states for any revenue loss in the first five years of rollout of the proposed indirect tax regime.
  



  The Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, decided to include in the Constitutional Amendment Bill that any dispute between states and the Centre will be adjudicated by the GST Council, which will have representation from both the Centre and states.
  



  With states on board and the Cabinet approving the amendments, the government is hopeful of passage of the long-pending Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, which ends on August 12.
  



  The [GST Bill](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/GST-Bill), with the changes approved by the Cabinet, could come up in the Rajya Sabha as early as this week, but certainly by next week.
  



  The changes approved by the Cabinet are to the Constitutional Amendment Bill that was approved by the Lok Sabha in May last year. Once the Rajya Sabha approves the legislation, the amended Bill will have to go back to the Lok Sabha again for approval.
  



  ""The amendments to the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill have been cleared,"" a top official said after the meeting of the [Union Cabinet](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Union-Cabinet) chaired by Modi.
  



  The amendments were taken up by the Cabinet after Finance Minister [Arun Jaitley](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arun-Jaitley)'s assurance to state finance ministers to include in the Bill the mechanism of compensating states for all the loss of revenue for five years.
  



  The Bill, in its present form, provides that the Centre will give 100 per cent compensation to states for first three years, 75 per cent and 50 per cent for the next two years.
  



  However, the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha had in its report recommended 100 per cent compensation for probable loss of revenue for five years.
  



  As per the amendments, the Centre will now constitutionally guarantee states any loss of revenue from the GST subsuming all indirect taxes, including VAT, in the first five years of introduction.
  



  By doing away with the 1 per cent inter-state tax over and above the GST rate, the government has met one of the three key demands over which Opposition Congress has been blocking the Bill in the Upper House.
  



  The other demands of including GST rate in the statute and a Supreme Court judge-headed dispute resolution body has not been accepted. It remains to be seen if meeting of its demands halfway will persuade the Congress to support the legislation.
  



  There is a talk of mentioning the GST rate in one of the two supporting legislations that need to be passed after the Constitution is amended, a move that may pacify the Congress.
  



  The government plans to roll out GST by April 1, 2017, and is working overtime to build consensus to get the Bill passed in the ongoing session.
  



  With the Congress demand of getting GST rate capped in the Bill delaying its passage, the Centre on Tuesday built a broad consensus with the states that the rate should not be mentioned in the Constitution and instead could figure in GST law.
  



  It was also assured that the tax rate in the new regime, which is to be decided by the GST Council, will be less than what it is at present.
  



  ""The amendments will pave the way for political consensus and early passage of the Bill in the monsoon session,"" EY National Leader (indirect tax) Harishanker Subramaniam said.
  



  In the new regime, there will be one Central GST or C-GST and State GST or S-GST. States levy sales tax or VAT on goods sold within their jurisdiction and get a Central Sales Tax (CST) on sales made outside their territories.
  



  This CST will no longer be available in the new regime and a 1 per cent additional tax was proposed to make up for that.
  



  GST being a constitutional amendment requires to be passed by Parliament with two-thirds majority and after that, 50 per cent of state assemblies will have to pass the legislation.
  



  Thereafter, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha will have to pass the central GST Bill and the states have to pass their own GST Bills.
  



  After the legislative procedure gets over, the GST Council, which will be the decision-making body on all issues, including rates of the new tax, will come into play.
  



  The Council will be chaired by Union Finance Minister, but Centre's voting share will be one-third and all decisions of the council would be taken by 75 per cent majority.
  



  Terming compensation guarantee as a very big development, Chairman of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers Amit Mitra had on Tuesday said appropriate wordings on compensation would give confidence to the states regarding the Centre's intention.
  



  ""I cannot go into details of the wordings, I can only give you spirit of it. States are satisfied that in the constitutional amendment, the wording (will be provided) by which states will be guaranteed five years of compensation if there is any loss of revenue,"" Mitra said.
  



  The GST Bill, which intends to convert 29 states into a single market through a new indirect tax regime, was earlier planned to be introduced from April 1 this year, but the deadline was missed as the legislation to roll it out remains in limbo in the Opposition-dominated Rajya Sabha.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The government is infusing fresh urgency into implementation of the Swachh Bharat Rural scheme after a detailed review by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month triggered concerns that at its current pace the flagship cleanliness programme could miss its deadline of 2019.Barely 11 per cent of India's 6.38 lakh villages have turned open defecation free so far, with only 17 of the 683 districts declared ODF 22 months after the programme was initiated.

&gt; * The programme envisages to make India totally ODF by building 12 crore toilets, of which just two crore have been built.Big states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar ruled by non-NDA parties have managed to turn just 1 per cent of their villages ODF while others including Tamil Nadu , Odisha and Karnataka have reported less than 10 per cent coverage.

&gt; * On the other hand, BJP-ruled Gujarat , Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Haryana have shown vast improvement.Senior government officials told ET that the PM's detailed review in June for ""a course correction"" has led to the scheme being divided into phases, with 173 districts in 23 states being identified as ""low hanging fruits"" that can be turned ODF quickly due to their pace of progress and because ""committed collectors"" are in charge there.Simultaneously, the Centre will closely monitor 70 districts which are the poorest performers in the country, such as Sultanpur, Agra and Etah in UP and Supaul, Araria and Madhubani in Bihar.

&gt; * About 80 more districts could go ODF by next March,"" Iyer told ET.The political support from the CM's, especially of Bihar, UP and Tamil Nadu, is crucial and hence their re-endorsement of the scheme is being sought, another official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

---

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Indian conglomerate Adani Group has started building the country's first transshipment port, conceived 25 years ago, and the government will construct another $4-billion facility nearby to create a shipping hub rivalling Chinese facilities in the region.The government will grant Gautam Adani 16 billion rupees ($240 million) in so-called ""viability gap"" funding to help the new port at Vizhinjam in Kerala win business from established hubs elsewhere in Asia.Once Vizhinjam is operational, the central government will start building the port of Enayam in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, said a senior shipping ministry official.

&gt; * Enayam alone will save more than $200 million in costs for Indian companies every year, he said.India's 7,500-km (4,700-mile) coastline juts into one of the world's main shipping routes and Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to capitalise on that proximity by developing ports that can shift freight on to huge vessels capable of carrying up to 18,000 20-foot containers.By bringing onshore cargo handling now done at entrepots in Sri Lanka, Dubai and Singapore, Modi's government expects cargo traffic at its ports to jump by two-thirds by 2021 as India ramps up exports of goods including cars and other machinery.The lack of an Indian domestic trans-shipment port forces inbound and outbound containers to take a detour to one of those regional hubs before heading to their final destination.New Delhi expects the new ports to save Indian companies hundreds of millions of dollars in transport costs, as well as ease concerns over the growing strategic clout in South Asia of rival China, which has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Sri Lankan ports at Colombo and Hambantota.Adani wants the Vizhinjam port, which an arm of his Adani Group is building at a cost of around $1 billion, to be operational in 2018.

&gt; * ""The port can attract a large share of the container trans-shipment traffic destined for, or originating from, India which is now being diverted primarily through Colombo, Singapore and Dubai,"" said an Adani Group executive who declined to be named.But officials acknowledge that it would be difficult for the new ports to win international clients unless they offered discounts.

&gt; * ""Very few days or weeks pass without news of a new hub port proposal in southern India,"" said Andy Lane, a partner at maritime and port consultant CTI Consultancy.He added that, as Colombo was a ""low cost and highly efficient"" port, container shipping lines were unlikely to easily consider a switch to India.

&gt; * Silence, in this instance, is complicity.Apart from calls for censorship and filing criminal cases against journalists, in his broadcast on ""Pro Pakistan Doves"", Mr Goswami was also guilty of both falsehood and brazen hypocrisy.

&gt; * If the government is ""pulling up a section of the media"" - though it sounded more like Mr Goswami actually encouraged the I&amp;B Minister to do so - isn't it his job to stand up against that instead of celebrate it?

&gt; * Have we heard Mr Goswami question the ""doves"" in the PDP or their partners in the BJP?Remember the number of times Mr Goswami ranted against other channels for getting an exclusive he hadn't - he would always say it's because he asked the tough questions we didn't.

  NEW DELHI: AAP MLA Asim Ahmed Khan, who was sacked from the Delhi Cabinet last year on charges of corruption, on Thursday alleged that he and his family are facing ""death threats"" from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and some of his partymen.
  





  The Matia Mahal legislator's allegation comes a day after the AAP chief in a video message made a sensational claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi may ""get me killed"" in the wake of ""unprecedented crackdown"" by the BJP government.
  





  ""For 9-10 months I have been facing death threats and even my family is at risk ... Kejriwal and some of his partymen are hatching a conspiracy to get me killed,"" Khan alleged at a press conference here.
  





  The former Food and Civil Supplies and Environment Minister was sacked by Kejriwal last October for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 6 lakh to allow the construction of a building in his constituency.
  





  ""I have been issued death threats over phone and also in person. I have already filed complaints with the police. I had even written a letter on May 2 to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh telling my case and also sent it to the LG,"" he claimed.
  





  ""Through this press conference, I would also like to request to the Home Minister to provide security to me and my family,"" he said. He also distributed copies of the 'letter' to the media.
  





  The sacked MLA also claimed that ""I have in my possession some of the audio and video recordings on the Kejriwal government, and I will soon make those evidences public, and expose the real face of Kejriwal.""
  





  Asked whether the party will take any action against him, AAP spokesperson Deepak Bajpai said, ""He was sacked from the cabinet and the case was forwarded to the CBI. Can any action be bigger than that?""
  





  Reacting to the allegations made by Khan, Bajpai mockingly said, ""He has chosen a good season to come up with these baseless charges and I am sure the police will not waste a minute in making yet another arrest. But we hope Modiji will act first on the CBI complaint made by us against him.""

341,"&gt; Can you suggest some sources to learn Marathi? So far I only know three words - ikde, tikde and bhau. I'd love to learn more Marathi, at least good enough to have a basic conversation with someone.

 Try reading Marathi newspapers. Reading them for like 10 mins everyday for like 3 months will be more than enough. Speak with Marathi people and chat with them on Social Media even if you aren't good at it. I have an online friend from Karwar (now in Bangalore) who tries Marathi and I correct him from time to time.

&gt; On a related note, how popular is Hindi over there? In my travels, I could get by with Hindi, but I don't know MH well enough to know this. Is there an anti-Hindi movement over there? 


In my town, tbh I get to hear hindi like never. It isn't like what India's view of Shivsena as Talibaan has played a role in this, but here even my Muslim, Marwadi and Sindhi friends speak better Marathi than a typical high class Marathi guy who resorts to using English in everything, because well, he is high class. It was so in school and it is so now. In Akola, though, that is not the same. But the district isn't entirely Hindi anyway. Marathi is spoken like 85%.

I have pulled a Holden Caulfield to Nagpur once and I couldn't get a Marathi rickshaw-wala/cop to talk to. I had to look to roadside dolorous cyclists for asking address. They were Marathi, ofcourse.

In Crawford Market in Mumbai, it was even harder. But there were some marathi people  around, yes. 

So bottom line, Hindi is quite popular in cities. 

&gt; What has MH done right? MH has both a good GDP and a good HDI. That's pretty awesome and I'd love to know the reasons you think the state has progressed so much.

I can't answer this, but locally, I really am not happy with the BJP MLA and Shivsena MP here. My district doesn't have any big factory and farmers die here a lot. My mother's cousin has hanged himself 3 years ago and my father's maternal uncle jumped in a well in his field. Both were farmers and Marathas. 

&gt; What's with the political atmosphere over there? Congress had been ruling over there since 1999, what happened this time? And is NDA doing good so far? Who do you think would win the next elections?

The main reason for Congress' downfall was Adarsh Scam (and many other scams, ofc) and primarily Modi Wave. NDA is doing good, yes. Mind you, congress is still strong in local governments and rural areas. 

&gt; Please suggest some places to travel besides Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Ajanta/Ellora. Any one particular city you'd recommend?

Never been allowed to travel much, so no idea besides Anand Sagar in Shegaon, and Sai Baba Sansthan, Shirdi. My life remains limited to Washim-Akola-Amravati districts and an occasional trip to the Ministry of Maharashtra with father.  

About Shegaon -

&gt; Shegaon has a tourist attraction called ""Anand Sagar"", an INR 3 billion project.[2][3] It is maintained by the The Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan. It surrounds a big artificial lake. It has a meditation centre, an aquarium, temples, play grounds, lush green lawns and open theatre where fountain-show is conducted for entertainment. It has been beautifully decorated with state of art artefacts and carvings all over. An amusement park has also started with a toy train encircling the entire place.

[This video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEgT_OA8NoU) will give you a general idea about Shegaon.

[Pictures of Shegaon] (https://www.google.com/search?q=shegaon&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizmcWE2pbOAhUBt48KHXAlA0gQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=759).

&gt; What can be done about the farmer suicides in MH/MP area? Should Vidarbha be crafted into a new state?

Farmer suicides, I guess quality education in rural areas is a must to counter it. No, separate Vidarbha will give nothing. 

&gt; How do common Maharashtrians view the rest of the states?

The place I live in, to be honest, since it isn't a city and my whole colony has some son of a farmer from a nearby village as family head, nobody really gives a damn about other states and India for that matter (except on National holidays and when sending their kid to a city (80% times Pune) for education) and are content with thinking of themselves and their loved ones.",2016-07-28 23:17:11

New Delhi:  
  Two more Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lawmakers are in trouble in Delhi. One of them, Rajesh Rishi, has been accused of extortion and named in a police complaint by an AAP woman worker who allegedly attempted suicide.



 
The other, Kartar Singh Tanwar, found an income tax team at his doorstep this morning.



Mr Rishi has denied any links with the activist who allegedly attempted suicide on July 15 over a dispute with a colleague. The police say both women have filed FIRs or First Information Reports, one naming the legislator.



 
The woman allegedly tried to kill herself after leaving a note in which she alleged that she had been harassed by her colleague and the lawmaker.



 
Her husband has now been accused of rape in a complaint by the second woman.



 
Mr Rishi, the legislator from Janakpuri in west Delhi, claims that he has been ""unnecessarily dragged"" into a fight between two women.



 
He said: ""I do not know the woman who has levelled allegations against me. But, I know the other woman as a party worker. My name has been unnecessarily dragged into their dispute.""



 
Karan Singh Tanwar, the lawmaker from Chhattarpur in South Delhi, also faces a case after tax raids at his home. Mr Tanwar is among five businessmen whose houses were being searched on Wednesday morning.



 
After the arrest of 11 AAP lawmakers on various charges, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other party leaders have repeatedly accused the Modi government of persecuting party men.



 
Two AAP lawmakers were arrested within 12 hours on the weekend - Amanatullah Khan, the party's lawmaker from Okhla, was arrested forallegedly trying to run over a woman protesting outside his home against power cuts and Naresh Yadav, AAP lawmaker from Mehrauli, is accused of desecrating the holy Quran.



 
Mr Kejriwal has described his party's power struggle with the BJP in Delhi as a ""holy war between Kauravas and Pandavas"", referencing the epic Mahabharat.

&gt; * The columnist Pratap Bhanu Mehta argued of the reshuffle that Many new faces are about signalling that the government is going to have to do that job of social mediation. But only one new Muslim, MJ Akbar, was brought into the cabinet, while one, Najma Heptullah, was moved out.

&gt;* In fact there are many political observers who have been concerned about the safety of Delhi CM for months now, considering the track-record of the incumbent Prime Minister and his closest aide Amit Shah, who is also the BJP President today, in alleged misuse of state apparatus for purging of rivals and opponents.

&gt;* It is rather intriguing that the CBI Special Court reportedly dropped charges against Shah apparently in the absence of legal evidence against him in December 2014, just a few months after Modi took over as the Prime Minister of India in May the same year.

&gt;* Moreover, the diabolic manner in which the BJP-led Centre has used the might of the state against AAP MLAs and its leadership or those perceived close to the fledgling party in recent times is rather unparalleled in the history of Indian politics.

&gt;* Besides, a number of FIRs/complains/PILs and other court cases have been filed against many other AAP leaders including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Kumar Vishwas, Kapil Mishra, Rakhi Birla, Ashish Khetan, Raghav Chadha, Dilip Pandey and Ashutosh.

&gt;* Iintriguingly on the same day, the Central Ministry of Home Affairs, also transferred Kejriwals assistant secretary to Andaman drawing allegations from AAP that all of this is a part of the larger plan of paralysing the Delhi government.

  For private-sector executives in India who normally get only snippets of information to design components of complex military hardware, climbing into tanks and talking to combat soldiers is an eye-opener.  

 

  Earlier this month, more than 200 representatives of defense companies -- big and small, local and foreign -- got unprecedented access to India's secretive military. At two events in the western city of Ahmednagar, they crawled inside tanks, learned about the army's equipment needs and spoke with troops on the front lines in Kashmir, a region also claimed by main rival Pakistan.  

 

  ""You could feel how the soldier would adjust themselves in a tight space,"" said Rajesh Khurana, an associate vice-president at Bharat Forge Ltd., a major Indian manufacturing defense firm, who noted that he personally climbed inside of a tank. ""It was a pretty intimate affair.""  

 

  The new-found transparency is part of Modi's efforts to transform the world's biggest arms importer into a defense manufacturing powerhouse as he spends $150 billion over the next decade to modernize the armed forces. Closer collaboration with the military would increase the technological capacity of local companies and create jobs as more than 10 million Indians join the work force each year.  

 

 Opening Up  ""We've seen the army open up under this current leadership,"" said Jayant D Patil, a senior vice-president with Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd, which makes parts for everything from missiles to submarines. ""The army is trying to build a relationship with the private sector. They're communicating what their real needs are and want us to know what kind of problems they see in their day to day life -- and then industry can build solutions.""  

 

  For the past few decades, publicly owned defense companies have repeatedly failed to do just that.  

 

  Almost two-thirds of the army's contracts for critical weapons and equipment concluded from 2007 to 2012 -- worth nearly $4.5 billion -- were delayed, India's national auditor said in a report this week. The foot-dragging was so severe that it ""hampered"" the military's modernization plan and impacted defense preparedness, the report said, blaming the delays in part on a ""heavy dependence"" on imported weapons.  

 

 Arms Imports  Nitin Wakankar, a defense ministry spokesman, had no comment on the auditor's report. In response to questions, the army said the Ahmednagar events stemmed from Modi's campaign for companies to ""Make in India."" The policy aimed to ""harness the preparedness of the Indian private industry towards meeting the felt-needs of the armed forces"" and ""reduce dependence on foreign vendors,"" it said.  

 

  The government's move to open itself up to private industry marks a ""very, very significant departure"" from the norm, said Anit Mukherjee, an assistant professor at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. ""It will be a significant step toward fulfilling 'Make in India.'""  

 

  India relies on imports for 60 per cent of its defense requirements, much of which has come from Russia due to a previous Cold War alliance between Delhi and the Soviet Union. Of late, it has bought more weapons from the US, becoming one of the top markets for American defense companies.  

 

  The Ahmednagar events featured executives from Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd, Tata Group, Larsen &amp; Toubro and Bharat Forge. Participation among foreign defense companies was limited to those with India offices, including Honeywell International Inc. and Dassault Aviation SA.  

 

 'Blind Guess'  All attendees had to be Indian nationals, vetted and approved by the army. The invitations to small-and-medium-sized defense firms were a first in a sector that prizes scale and a country that tends to favor conglomerates.  

 

  Subimal Bhattacharjee, a security expert and former India country head for US-based defense firm General Dynamics Corp., said the military went beyond merely talking about its equipment: Army officials, who wanted a new engine design, actually gave six Russian-made infantry combat vehicles to two private companies.  

 

  ""You have a chance to see the vehicle with the whole team, to have a clear understanding of what can be done,"" said Bhattacharjee, who attended the event. ""You don't have to make a blind guess. You have a vehicle to yourself that you can play around with and understand better.""  

 

 Defense Failures  India's defense companies have a long track record of failing to deliver. A 40-year effort by the government to develop a battlefield tank has yet to produce anything the army can use. Similarly, a project to produce an anti-tank guided missile has seen repeated setbacks, forcing India to acquire them from Russia, France and Israel.  

 

  The army had previously refused to discuss procurement projects unless they received a formal request, Deepak Sinha, a retired army veteran who oversaw procurement for the Indian Special Forces, said in an e-mail. And even then the military never told defense contractors about ""procurement philosophy or future plans,"" he said.  

 

  ""The army has always preferred to keep interaction with business houses to the minimum,"" said Sinha, who served in the military for more than three decades. ""This interaction with business executives would certainly be a first, and a very good omen at that.""

___



___

New Delhi: The last date for filing income-tax returns has been extended to August 5.



 
Tax returns for 2015-16 (assessment year 2016-17) were originally to be filed by July 31. But in view of the day-long strike at public sector banks, the deadline has been extended to August 5.  
  
  



Show Full Article

 
For Jammu and Kashmir, the deadline will be August 31 in view of the ongoing turmoil in the state.



 
""In view of today's bank strike and disturbance in J&amp;K;, the due date of IT return filing is being extended,"" Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said in a tweet today.



 
For assessees across India liable to file I-T returns by July 31, the deadline is extended up to August 5, he said. 



 
""For assessees in J&amp;K;, this date has been extended to August 31,"" the secretary added.



 
Later, the Finance Ministry in a statement said, ""As per provisions of Section 139(1) of Income-tax Act 1961, Central Board of Direct Taxes extends the due date for filing returns of Income for Assessment Year 2016-2017 from July 31, 2016 to August 5, 2016, in case of taxpayers throughout India who are liable to file their Income-tax by July 31, 2016.""



 
This extension, it said, is given in order to avoid any inconvenience to the taxpayers while making payment of taxes pertaining to returns of income for Assessment Year 2016- 2017 by July 31, 2016 due to bank strike on July 29 and July 31 being a bank-holiday.

  The integrity index would be developed for 25 major government entities and top public sector undertakings such as IOCL, ONGC, NTPC, Railways, Bhel, FCI, EPFO, DDA and MCD (South), CBDT, Mumbai Port Trust, Punjab National Bank and SAIL among others.  

 

  The corruption index for these public sector organisations will be based on benchmarking of governance processes by internal and external stakeholders, according to the CVC. The integrity index will help the CVC undertake a ""research based approach"" that can also be used by various organisations to measure them and ""will evolve with changing needs.""  

          

  ""This is for the first time such a ranking is being developed by the Commission. It will help in ensuring probity in public organisations in future,"" a senior CVC official told ET.  

 

  The probity watchdog also hopes that the integrity index helps to create an objective and reliable tool that can measure the performance of organisations. The study will be conducted over a period 12 months and once the agreement is signed, the institution conducting the study will be required to submit a detailed report on the lines of Berlin-based Transparency International that ranked India 76th among 168 countries that it surveyed for Global corruption index.  

 

  According to CVC guidelines, the selected agency will also be responsible for developing a five-year draft road map for the integrity index and its associated ecosystem. ""Propose a road map for the formulation, establishment and development of process, organisatuon and structure for such measurement, advocacy and use of the scores,"" reads the CVC guidelines.  

 

  The purpose of this study will also be to define what constitutes integrity of public organisations, identify the different factors of integrity and their inter-linkages and to validate the findings over a period of time to improve upon the robustness of the tool that measures integrity, the CVC official added.

404,"[My original blogpost] (http://isisindia.blogspot.com/2016/01/india-faces-a-critical-choice-on-syria.html)

With Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al Muallem's visit to Delhi almost over, India faces a critical choice on the issue of Syria. While India has announced its readiness to [send troops to fight] (http://isisindia.blogspot.com/2015/12/india-ready-for-operation-against.html) the Islamic State under the auspices of the UN, such an action would bring with it the risk of being perceived as ""anti-Sunni."" Damascus has clearly expressed that what it needs is food and medicine supplies. As an agrarian nation, India can do much to help Syria and the Syrian people. However such an action would bring about a shift of India's stance on the Syrian civil war from centerist to pro-government.

The distribution of potential Indian food supplies to Syria will receive priority in territory-controlled by the Syrian government. To ensure that both domestic Muslim sentiment as well as India's strategic priority to see the Syrian government survive are upheld, Prime Minster Narendra Modi could use a Twitter approach to ensure that food supplies are delivered, under the eye of the Red Cross, to rebel-held areas as well.


Modi, an avid user of social media, could request Syrian users of Indian raw food products to upload photos of themselves with the items. Such an action would ensure that war-torn areas of Syria facing starvation such as Madaya in southern Syria and Idlib and Aleppo (among others) receive food, something which they have been lacking throughout the conflict. Starvation as a weapon has been used by both sides in the conflict. In rebel-held Idlib province, the [Shia villages of Fua and Kafraya] (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-madaya-aid-besieged-shiite-villages-idlib-outcry-starving-children/) have been under siege by rebels including Jabhat Al Nusra, the official franchise of Al Qaeda in Syria.


By providing food supplies but insisting Syrians in rebel-held areas also receive the benefit of Indian humanitarian assistance, Modi could score brownie points with Indian Muslims as well as raise his standing in the Arab and Islamic world.

&gt;* In fact there are many political observers who have been concerned about the safety of Delhi CM for months now, considering the track-record of the incumbent Prime Minister and his closest aide Amit Shah, who is also the BJP President today, in alleged misuse of state apparatus for purging of rivals and opponents.

&gt;* It is rather intriguing that the CBI Special Court reportedly dropped charges against Shah apparently in the absence of legal evidence against him in December 2014, just a few months after Modi took over as the Prime Minister of India in May the same year.

&gt;* Moreover, the diabolic manner in which the BJP-led Centre has used the might of the state against AAP MLAs and its leadership or those perceived close to the fledgling party in recent times is rather unparalleled in the history of Indian politics.

&gt;* Besides, a number of FIRs/complains/PILs and other court cases have been filed against many other AAP leaders including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Kumar Vishwas, Kapil Mishra, Rakhi Birla, Ashish Khetan, Raghav Chadha, Dilip Pandey and Ashutosh.

&gt;* Iintriguingly on the same day, the Central Ministry of Home Affairs, also transferred Kejriwals assistant secretary to Andaman drawing allegations from AAP that all of this is a part of the larger plan of paralysing the Delhi government.

___

New Delhi:&amp;#xA0;Indian conglomerate Adani Group has started building the country's first transshipment port, conceived 25 years ago, and the government will construct another $4-billion facility&amp;hellip;

___

New Delhi: Indian conglomerate Adani Group has started building the country's first transshipment port, conceived 25 years ago, and the government will construct another $4-billion facility nearby to create a shipping hub rivalling Chinese facilities in the region.
New Delhi will grant billionaire Gautam Adani Rs 1,600 crore ($240 million) in so-called ""viability gap"" funding to help the new port at Vizhinjam in Kerala win business from established hubs elsewhere in Asia.


Once Vizhinjam is operational the central government will start building the port of Enayam in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, said a senior shipping ministry official. Enayam alone will save more than $200 million in costs for Indian companies every year, he said.


India's 7,500-km (4,700-mile) coastline juts into one of the world's main shipping routes and Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to capitalise on that proximity by developing ports that can shift freight on to huge vessels capable of carrying up to 18,000 20-foot containers.


By bringing onshore cargo handling now done at entrepots in Sri Lanka, Dubai and Singapore, Modi's government expects cargo traffic at its ports to jump by two-thirds by 2021 as India ramps up exports of goods including cars and other machinery.


The lack of an Indian domestic transshipment port forces inbound and outbound containers to take a detour to one of those regional hubs before heading to their final destination.


New Delhi expects the new ports to save Indian companies hundreds of millions of dollars in transport costs, as well as ease concerns over the growing strategic clout in South Asia of rival China, which has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Sri Lankan ports at Colombo and Hambantota.


Adani wants the Vizhinjam port, which an arm of his Adani Group is building at a cost of around $1 billion, to be operational in 2018. The port lies hard by the Gulf-to-Malacca shipping lane that carries almost a third of world sea freight.


""The port can attract a large share of the container transshipment traffic destined for, or originating from, India which is now being diverted primarily through Colombo, Singapore and Dubai,"" said an Adani Group executive who declined to be named.


But officials acknowledge that it would be difficult for the new ports to win international clients unless they offered discounts.


""A major part of transshipment is happening at nearby ports. We can win some of that business,"" said A.S. Suresh Babu, who heads a government agency set up by Kerala to facilitate the construction of Vizhinjam.


""There's a viability issue in the first few years. Already the Chinese are operating there. So unless you give some discount you can't attract these ships. So that's why the government of India has approved the viability gap funding.""


CHINESE THREAT


India is worried about China's expanding reach in the region through port investments in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Maldives. China is also developing Pakistan's Gwadar seaport as part of a $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.


China had also wanted to partner with an Indian company to build the Vizhinjam port, but its proposal was rejected by the government on grounds of national security.


India has not banned Chinese firms from investing in its ports, but takes a cautious approach as most ports are also used for ""strategic purposes"", said the shipping ministry source.


That is a euphemism for dual-use port facilities that could also be used by naval vessels. The docking of a Chinese nuclear submarine at Colombo's commercial port in 2014 shocked India's security establishment and has added urgency to New Delhi's push to strengthen its port infrastructure.


Vizhinjam port will have dedicated berths for India's navy and coastguard, according to a government note seen by Reuters.


India is also seeking to extend its commercial and strategic reach as it tries to catch up with China, pledging up to $500 million to develop the Iranian port of Chabahar to give it trade access to Iran, Afghanistan and the hinterlands of Central Asia, now largely blocked by Pakistan.


""We want Indian ports to compete with the best ports in the world in various parameters like turnaround time, efficiency, last-mile connectivity, infrastructure etc,"" India's Shipping Ministry said in a statement to Reuters.


But analysts remain sceptical that India can complete the transshipment ports, given that it has taken a quarter of a century to get the Vizhinjam port plan this far after legal disputes and lack of security clearance from the federal government delayed previous attempts to build it.


""Very few days or weeks pass without news of a new hub port proposal in Southern India,"" said Andy Lane, a partner at maritime and port consultant CTI Consultancy.


He added that, as Colombo was a ""low cost and highly efficient"" port, container shipping lines were unlikely to easily consider a switch to India. ($1 = 67.3420 Indian rupees)

He killed several people's lives for heaven's sake. Did you hear even a single friend of yours in real life saying that kasab should not be hanged? No. But in the TV they were showing that the entire day.

&gt; Modi receives a lot of negative attention from the media. 

he's just one man in the party doing what he can. He can't control the entire BJP party for the moronic things they say. But one BJP guy says something and the media blows it out of proportion.

Contrast this with what was happening when Congress was there - the banana republic comment. And the media didn't follow it after that.

Today if Rahul makes a senseless remark on modi it gets published on the front page. If Modi replies to it then that doesn't get published.

All this makes me feel that our media is (1) very pessimistic. (2) it is pro-congress.

You can ignore the 2nd point. Maybe I'm wrong about it. but for (1) it is the truth. All this negativity that you see online, in people around you is all reaction to that media. Everyone reads the shit they post everyday and people have all that negativity pent up inside.

  Five years ago, the Swedish government set up a department whose only concern was the future. Not the immediate few decade, but across time ture of the next decade, but across time -half a century and beyond. The department examines public health, education, housing and other areas of welfare.  

 

  This, from a people-centric socialist democracy that has made public welfare into a careful equation. In the US, similar concerns are being addressed at private platforms funded by philanthropic institutions to create opportunities and safeguards for their people. Other countries in Europe have devised hypothetical scenarios of increasing population densities, new settlements, fuel and energy requirements, etc and proposed physical solutions for them. New cities with altogether different, experimental parameters are also coming up in China and Abu Dhabi.  

 

  Where does this place a country soon to be the most populous by 2025, with 50 megacities, each with more than a million people? How is India placed to tackle future problems of so great a magnitude, when the scourge of the present casts such a spell of doom? The lack of social, political and financial resolve that taints the country with a dismal annual performance, also makes it most suited to have a Ministry for the Future, like Sweden. What would India be like in 2050 and beyond could be correlated by simple math and multiplication.  

 

  But what would we want India to be like in 2050 is an altogether different -and more difficult -question. Sweden's Council for the Future examines methods of cooperation between countries, ways to reconcile competitiveness, employment opportunities in emerging fields and new forms of inclusive social development. All of it sounds suitably vague, but with education, environment, and innovation under review, the council seeks a challenge far beyond conventional answers, and originally proposed the question, ""If the president were to appoint a cabinet member to worry about future generations, what would hisher job be?"" It is a question India should have asked after Independence.  

 

  The failure of the country's housing, education and health policies has so far been related primarily to inadequate provision; there was never enough to go around. The population has bloomed into so unwieldy a behemoth that conventional programmes will always be mired in shortfalls. Look at the government programme to provide a house for every family. In 1990, according to the National Building Organization, housing requirement in the country stood at two crore units. A decade later, the demand rose to four crore and today it stands at a whopping 5.5 crore. Similar stories show up in public health, rural education, civic utilities and infrastructure. Despite many successes, the backlog is always on the rise.  

 

  If the current scenarios look bleak, it is only because the situation demands instantaneous solutions. When drought hits a state, the demand for water is immediate; when cars flood roads, the PWD starts work on road widening. Indian in stitutional structures are fixated on solving the immediate problem, or at least appearing to do so. The distant future calls for no such deliberate and measured action. Its unpredictability, and consequently its resolution of projected scenarios, calls for flights of the imagination that must rely on invention and ingenuity .  

 

  Sixteenth-century Italy had no explicit need for a flying machine, yet Leonardo da Vinci's drawings for his model came from his own mental mappings. Similarly , a glass dome over New York City was one of Buckminster Fuller's many far-fetched ideas. In it was a suggestion of the ecological problems he foresaw in the place. Like ministers for the future, both were ahead of their time. Having achieved some notoriety in official circles for their inventiveness, and social labels that varied from genius to crank, both enjoyed immunity from conventions of the time. So should the ministry .  

 

  Since Prime Minister Modi is much too preoccupied with issues of the present, he needs the support of a full-time Ministry of the Future.Like Sweden, obviously any intervention in the future will have to look beyond current solutions to ask impossible questions. Are there ways of providing nutrition to waterless rural areas without conventional crop cycles? Is it possible to shelter people without the cumbersome physical structures of housing? Could drones be used as mobile hospitals to bring health facilities where needed? Can virtual teachers and schools be sent to children unable to attend classes?  

 

  Freed of conventional thought processes, the future may come with surprising solutions. If Modi is interested in looking beyond the immediate competition with China, and leaving more than just a copycat legacy , he will need to formulate a ministry that looks beyond his own lifetime.

421,"Manohar Parrikar's comments on Aamir Khan show how hate may have vitiated business mood

---

&gt;* Defence minister Manohar Parrikar seems to have spilled the beans on something everybody knew and has been talking about and his words speak volumes about the business environment in India.

&gt;* Khanat a function in November 2015had said that there is a sense for fear and insecurity in the face of rising violence against minority communities in India.

&gt;* Reverse logistics - a term that denotes such returning of products and the costs incurred on that count - has been one of the worst nightmares of the Indian e-commerce companies.

&gt;* The strategy used by the online team, who Parrikar thinks were thoda jaste hoshar (very smart), to teach Snapdeal a lesson needs to be seen in this context.

&gt;* It is also ironical that this happened at a time when prime minister Narendra Modi shouts at the top of his voice at all platforms available how his government has turned India into an investor's safe haven.

NEW DELHI: India is now planning ""a direct strategic purchase"" of six flight refuelling aircraft (FRA) or tankers to enhance the reach of its fighter jets, bombers and surveillance aircraft after the bid to acquire them through global tenders failed twice over the last decade.


 the defence ministry (MoD)+has scrapped the proposed Rs 9,000 crore contract for acquisition of six Airbus-330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport) aircraft, which was hanging fire for several years due to high costs as well as old CBI cases and change in the manufacturer's name from EADS Cassidian to Airbus Group.


 operational necessity for IAF+,"" said a top MoD source.



Interestingly, the NDA government citedIAF's ""critical operational necessity"" as well as the need to cut time and costs to go in for the direct acquisition of 36 Rafale fighters in a government-to-government deal announced during the Modi-Hollande summit in Paris in April last year.



Simultaneously, it had scrapped the original $20 billion MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) project to acquire 126 Rafale jets, the commercial negotiations for which were deadlocked after the French fighter's selection over Eurofighter Typhoon, American F/A-18 and F-16, Swedish Gripen and Russian MiG-35.





It was in 2006 that IAF had first asked for acquisition of six more tankers after inducting six Ilyushin-78 mid-air refuelling aircraft in 2003-2004. While the IL-78s are based at Agra to support operations against Pakistan, the six new tankers were meant for Panagarh (West Bengal) to take care of China.



As was earlier reported by TOI, the two-engine A-330 MRTT was twice selected over the four-engine Russian IL-78 in technical and commercial evaluation over the last decade. But there were ""concerns"" over the life cycle cost (LCC) methodology used in selecting A-330 MRTT over the IL-78. The LCC basically identifies ""total cost of ownership"" of an aircraft or other equipment through its entire operational life of 25-30 years.



""With oil prices drastically dropping, Russia was contesting the LCC model used to select A-330 MRTT over the IL-78 (guzzles more fuel with four engines but cheaper off-the-shelf). There were finance ministry's objections and other problems,"" said a source.

**Description**: It is 1839 and tension has been rapidly mounting between China and
British India following the crackdown on opium smuggling by Beijing.
With no resolution in sight, the colonial government declares war. One
of the vessels requisitioned for the attack, the Hind, travels eastwards
from Bengal to China, sailing into the midst of the First Opium War. The
turbulent voyage brings together a diverse group of travellers, each
with their own agenda to pursue. Among them is Kesri Singh, a sepoy in
the East India Company who leads a company of Indian sepoys; Zachary
Reid, an impoverished young sailor searching for his lost love, and
Shireen Modi, a determined widow en route to China to reclaim her
opium-trader husband's wealth and reputation. Flood of Fire follows a
varied cast of characters from India to China, through the outbreak of
the First Opium War and China's devastating defeat, to Britain's seizure
of Hong Kong.

New Delhi:  After the arrest of its Narela MLA Sharad Chauhan, 12th AAP lawmaker to be arrested by the police, the Aam Aadmi Party has launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking whether he (PM Modi) has lost his ""mental balance"" and questioned whether the country is ""safe"" in the hands of a person who acts with such ""vengeance"".



 
Aam Aadmi Party's Ashish Khetan alleged that PM Modi spends every waking moment in plotting the 'fixing' of all his political opponents.



 
He further alleged that Prime Minister Modi appears to be concerned only with political persecution.



""He (PM Modi) appears wholly unfit to lead this country as the Prime Minister. Can we trust the country's administration in the hands of a person who spends his every waking moment in plotting the fixing of all his political opponents? Is such a person psychologically and temperamentally fit to run the country?""



 
""The way Narendra Modi is running his reign of vindictive politics is dangerous for the country. He is targeting his opponents in a systematic manner, be it his action against (Gujarat cadre IAS officer) Pradeep Sharma, other officers, AAP MLAs or against the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi.""



 
AAP lawmaker Sharad Chauhan was arrested by the police in connection with the suicide of a woman worker of the ruling party, taking the total number of arrested AAP MLAs to 12.



 
Party leader Ashutosh said instead of appreciating AAP government's ""good"" work in health and education sector, the Prime Minister is sending its MLAs to jail.



 
""Another AAP MLA arrested. Has Modi gone mad? Has he lost his mental balance? If PM acts with such anger / vengeance then is country safe!""



 
""Great initiatives are taken by Delhi government in education-health... instead of praising, Modi is sending AAP MLAs to jail. Is the country safe in his hands?"" Ashutosh said.



 
Last week Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was conspiring to kill him.



 
After a CBI raid at Delhi Secretariat, Mr Kejriwal had also called the PM Modi a ""psychopath"".

470,"#Porn ban: SC women lawyers seek ban on free access to pornography, viewers should pay hefty charges to govt. 

___

*The Supreme Court Woman Lawyers' Association (SCWLA) says no porn site should have free access and those desperate to watch it should be made to pay a hefty amount which ""can act as a deterrent"".*

1. SCWLA says no porn site should have free access and those who watch should pay a hefty amount.

1. This they say will act as a deterrent and generate revenue for government.

1. They also call for complete blocking of eight sites including Xvideos.com, Xnxx.com etc.

The fight against online porn ban in India is just getting bigger. Women lawyers of the Supreme Court on whose plea its judges had five months ago asked the Modi government to find out ""ways and means"" to block pornography on the Internet and make watching of blue film in public an offence have struck again. NO FREE ACCESS



The Supreme Court Woman Lawyers' Association (SCWLA) says no porn site should have free access and those desperate to watch it should be made to pay a hefty amount which ""can act as a deterrent"". It also moots a ""revenue-generation model for the government"". It also wants establishing of rehabilitation centres across India for those ""addicted to porn"", and complete blocking of eight porn sites - Xvideos.com, Xnxx.com, Pornhub.com, Xhamster.com, Youporn.com, Redtube. com, Tube8.com, Hclips.com - which are ""very popular"" but most content in these are without the consent of the person figuring in the video. These are some of the suggestions SCWLA, which became a party in the public interest litigation (PIL) along with original petitioner and lawyer Kamlesh Vaswani, submitted to the SC on its directions. A bench headed by justice Dipak Misra had on February 26 this year asked for the suggestions so that ""it can pass it on to the competent authority of the central government"". HEFTY AMOUNT Referring to ""increasing"" instances where auto drivers, bus drivers and conductors indulge in molestation and sodomy, the affidavit says: ""Limited access to people making request to visit porn sites, may be provided (like VPN gateway server, etc) with certain conditions like instead of making payment to the service providers, a hefty amount be made to the government of India.""This way, it is reflected in the bank accounts, also people like auto drivers and people belonging to such similar strata of the society will have restricted access to online pornography. Also, it can be a great revenue-generating model for the government"". ""The government should make a security payment gateway before allowing any person to view porn online. Also, before the payment, details like name, address, contact number should be verified and only after the completion of such details, should the payment be allowed,"" said the affidavit filed by SCWLA secretary Prerna Kumari, which was drafted by senior lawyer Mahalakshmi Pavani. MORAL POLICING VS PRIVACYThe government, if need be, can also censor minors from viewing pornographic material by adopting such a measure, it says. The SC is exploring the possibility of banning watching of pornographic materials in any form at public places. Despite stiff objection from the Centre that said it only favoured banning child pornography sites and not ""going beyond"" considering a citizen's right to privacy and did not want to be seen ""moral policing"", the court has already directed the Centre to ""develop a mechanism"" for blocking all porn sites with the help of Information Technology experts and service providers.ALSO READ:Chennai techie couple earned Rs 2 crore from child porn sites, arrestedMan arrested for uploading ex-girlfriends videos on porn site

481,"&gt; I don't understand how the waiver could be unilateral if China and other members were part of it?

Because of the timeline, process and execution of events.  

US is a global hegemon and the lone Superpower and in early 2000's this was even more true, China had barely gotten in WTO, it wasn't the powerhouse it is today, Financial crisis was in the distance and Russia was irrelevant.  

US was bullying nations on all sorts of things. Then the Bush Administration decided to make a long term strategic play(because US isn't a superpower for nothing, it understands how this game works and it plans for it well), to right the wrong they and the Western world had done to India by bringing India to the Nuclear world order.  

They did this by basically bullying the European states into submission.  

Even the India-US agreement in writing mentioned (India made this a condition in fact) that US would lead the negotiations on behalf of India because Indians are hard negotiators and they didn't trust US anyway.  
US fulfilled its promise.  

China actually in 2008 (when we got the waiver) did protest internally with the NSG but because of 2 factors this didn't matter. 
They being, first US was able to rally everyone on board its side. Second China is non-confrontational on issues where its isolated. 
Meaning unless the issue is really significant (like its territorial or internal socio-political situations, etc) they will not act as a lone hold out.  

This is a very consistent stand of China over decades which is why it can be seen as valid and not just inference. China's action speak louder than its words, is what all this means. 

Meaning IF this year had there been a situation where the other nations had come together once again and left China as the lone hold out, it would have meant India would have gotten in this year alone because China will not use up its diplomatic capital to prevent India from entering NSG BECAUSE its not really that worthwhile because India ALREADY has everything it needs with the waiver so to spend your global leverage on trying to prevent something which isn't even worth it anymore makes little sense esp. given the track record of the type of global diplomacy that China conducts(which i listed above).  
Even at the UNSC China behaves like this, it will just abstain and either not bother with antagonizing anyone or just go with the consensus if its the lone last player on a position, unless the issue is serious in which case they usually abstain and move out.  
Their veto record is proof of this, they don't use it as much.  

In other UN processes they use administrative hurdles (like the Masood asset freeze deal, etc). These are basic tactics that diplomats play on a stage like the UN.  

The India media's portrayal of this issue was down right farcical and dangerous in fact.  
Indian media was concocting narratives out of thin air with 0 sources.  
Things that happened like the Tibetan meet Visa issue and the Interpol notice thing. Backing down. Indian media was all over the place when in fact barely any of it was that much related anyway.  

This fear psychosis is what really is the point of my previous comment.   
Always keep perspective and don't let the media narrative be a basis for your views on a subject matter of this level of complexity because the Media is firstly clueless and secondly its jingoistic and driven by an agenda.  


&gt; You could argue support for that waiver was rather forced than a genuine one but **that is quite useless difference in international relations**, isn't it?

It most definitely isn't.  

Nations states like Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Austria, NZ, etc. These are small western states which have nothing to do with Nuclear resources or even that much advanced technology or even plants for that matter (Australia a Nuclear fuel heavyweight has 0 Nuclear Plants in the country).  
These smaller nations aren't really bothered with India getting the deal and thus being an economic opportunity for them because they have very little of Nuclear Sector to being with.  
Furthermore these types of states have a different agenda which is things like Non-proliferation, clean energy, climate change, etc etc. And these states are a bit overzealous and idealogical on this front. Making them really hard to convince because they don't care for what the big powers want.   

So when the US forces these countries to make a compromise deal, its doing so because there is quid pro quo. This is the basis tenant of States since Human Civilizations arose.  

Meaning US pressure resulting in a special treatment was not useless, it is of tremendous importance. Everytime status quo gets changed BY INHERENT design things will be volatile with a certain spectrum of change. This is how the world of Nation States works.  

India is not special. But if its getting special treatment why shouldn't someone else? This is a question even a child will ask of this situation.  

&gt; If India gets membership in NSG despite being CTBT/NPT signatory with US backing would you still call that unilateral from US?

Unlike 2008 this time around due to domestic political concerns and global diplomatic commitments US didn't lead the Consensus Building drive in favor of India's membership.  
This was demonstrated factually over the course of the year. Where Obama is bogged down domestically with his Congress over deals that he does want and US's relation with Russia and China on different types of issues, i.e. Syria/ME-Ukraine, etc and for China they are negotiating a trade deal long in the works, they just exchanged Negative List for the Bilateral Investment Treaties plus US needs China's support on other things at the moment because China is no longer the China of 2000's, its very powerful.  

Also a proof of this dynamic was PM Modi going on a multi-Nations visit to bolster support because since US was not doing its bit the workload fell on India, this is also why the Govt was so hyping the situation because in their calculation this will generate support, they overestimated the level of support they expected and it was in hindsight a bad decision by the Govt.  

&gt; BTW if you think making exceptions for some countries at expense of others is bad then CTBT/NPT itself is a bad treaty because it makes exception for few countries and you know this exception in treaty is the reason India can not sign it and is being stopped from being part of NSG.

Of course. I mentioned this 2 times in my first comment.  

NSG got fast tracked into existence BECAUSE of India itself in the 70's. So it is rather ironic that now its India which has gotten this special treatment. But one can't just right a wrong with another dubious tactic and not expect a little backlash.  

As i said try to have some larger perspective. India has gotten a great great deal with the NSG waiver, its now in the MTCR, lets not get overboard in our reaction when some things don't run smoothly. Its a sign of immaturity and dangerous.

484,"All Because Of AAP, Gloats Arvind Kejriwal As Anandiben Patel Quits

---

&gt;* The BJP has accepted her offer and is expected to announce her replacement tomorrow, most likely Nitinbhai Patel, currently the state's Health Minister.Gujarat votes soon for its next government and local BJP leaders have been complaining, as ndtv.com reported in May , that Anandiben has steered the party's ebbing popularity in a state the party has governed for over a decade.Picked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his replacement in Gujarat in 2014, Anandiben posted that she turns 75 in two months and respects the BJP's principle of retiring older leaders to promote younger ones.

&gt;* BJP sources say that for obliging the party with her resignation, she could be appointed Governor soon.Last month, four young Dalit men in Una were tied to a car, stripped to their waists, and thrashed by cow vigilantes, who uploaded the video on social media.

&gt;* They point out that the victims had not slaughtered a cow but were skinning the carcass, an exacting and unenviable occupation thrust upon their caste.The Una attack has opened up the BJP to accusations of failing to protect the weakest sections of society just as two crucial states with large Dalit populations, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, rev into election mode.In parliament, opposition leaders have demanded an explanation from the centre, and Dalit leader Mayawati has reclaimed centre stage at a crucial point in Uttar Pradesh's timeline for its election.Last year, Anandiben was unable to effectively counter the aggressive campaign led by Hardik Patel, then just 22 years old.

&gt;* Rallying the Patil or Paridar community around him, the young leader drew mega crowds to public parks where he pilloried the BJP of abandoning one of its most loyal groups of supporters.Mr Patel demanded reserved government jobs and places in colleges for the Patidars, who, he said, had been excluded from the industry-centric development and prosperity of Gujarat.

&gt;* The government failed to appease both him and his supporters, and violence erupted across the state after an ill-advised late-night arrest of Mr Patel.Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party or AAP has been campaigning in Gujarat, claiming that the dissatisfaction with the government and the impotence of the Congress as the main opposition party, create the space he needs to create a new power centre.

1. her daughter &amp; her son's huge scams everywhere exposed. Weather its toll tax scandal or huge land grabbings their daughter and in-laws got huge number of bribes and very good postings all over gujarat.
2. she was put on by Modi because he did not want someone efficient as he feared his home base may create competition for himself. So he choose anandiben patel as Gujarat CM - she is corrupt to core and have no self respect.
3. She cleared amit shah allies from government as she wanted her own circle only. amit shah wanted to out her from CM post and wanted to be a CM. Modi played game and continued amit shah as bjp president for second term otherwise this would have been ended back in last August when patel community andolan happened.
