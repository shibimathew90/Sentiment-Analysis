1,"To put this in context, the Uri attack is a huge morale boost to Kashmiri separatists and will further fuel the already huge groundswell of Kashmiri seperatism. For Pakistan the end game is to put a high price on any Indian involvement in CPEC and Balochistan by continuing it's successful decades old strategy in Kashmir. This is a huge loss of face and morale to NaMo govt and army and a tactical win for Pak army.


However I feel Raheel Sharif has overplayed his hand at writing history. It's not just the Uri strike, the way Pak has escalated the situation in Kashmir has pushed India's back to the wall and a significant surprise response may now be coming. 



Currently Pak army is at a strategic disadvantage, it is spread thin battling insurgencies all over Pak, it's relations with its conventional ally US are extremely strained and its allies in the middle East such as Jordan, Syria, Turkey, UAE are already heavily invested in Syrian war. US pressure for cease fire will also be muted since they have the hawkish Trump to deal with and elections are almost here. China its only strong geopolitical ally is imo in a position to support it but I don't see any significant tech it can supply in a war, also it has no direct supply lines to Pak. Also any pressure on India's eastern flank could be out maneuvered by movement of US Navy/Japan/Vietnam in SCS which wants to pull back China a few notches. Worst of all for Pak, it has a new factor, the Afghan army and NDS to contend with at its western front. Iran will likely stay neutral for all intents in an India Pak conflict. Russia, Israel and France are in India's corner as always. So I would say this may actually be a perfect time to wage a thorough war in several decades. 



Politically too India has a reasonably competent PM at the helm and the opposition may certainty be relied upon to fully cooperate in a war like situation. 



So I hope to see a significant conventional millitary action to happen. I feel, a 'surgical strike' type ops is beyond our ability to execute in Pak, there is a high possibility that it fails and we face even more embarrassment. So a 'large' response seems the better option, where even if we pay a higher cost, possibility of a favorable outcome is higher due to size, technology and economic advantage that India enjoys. 


Extent of such large attack might be in Rajasthan/Gujrat border since Punjab and Kashmir have seen heavy rains which would impact troop movement. A two day war that ends with us being outside Karachi would be a great win. Sindh and Balochistan have an undercurrent of seperatism so RAW would already have assets who could help IA troop movement.",2016-09-19 15:13:33
2,"If this is true, then consider this   

- Currently manufacturing states (like MH, Gujarat) get more money than consuming states.   

- Post GST consuming states would get more revenue, so that this is equalised. 

- However, if manufacturing states lose revenue, they are not going to agree.  

- So govt is going to compensate them for their losses for 3-5 years - which is why MH govt is able to allay revenue-loss fears.     

- So consuming states will get more than what they used to get earlier &amp; manufacturing states will get the same as before.   

- Where the fuck is this extra money going to come from?   

- Obviously from us.   

- The GST rate will have be such that it will have to provide more tax revenue than before   

- Ergo, items will be costlier for us.    

- We are going to be butt-fucked for 3-5 years minimum.   

- By the end of 3-5 years we will be used to being butt-fucked.   

- We may even start enjoying it.   

- We can chant Namo, Namo while being butt-fucked.

&gt;But your previous comment indicates that you took the Pakistani Generals' word for it since they did not give any freedom to the journalists to pursue independent investigation and so their proof was little more than a guided tour. 

At least they provided that.

&gt; So, you don't really believe in any kind of evidence, but are swayed by your political beliefs.

Not at all. It is India's prerogative to provide evidence that a surgical strike has happened. Take out your saffron-tinted glasses and you will see that Pakistan has done a reasonable good job of convincing that it wasn't a surgical strike.

&gt; You do do not like the current regime (that's fine) and so you come up with these weak arguments for your stand rather than saying so outright.

Touchy baba. If the current regime is saying that it has done something, it has to provide proof for it. I am pretty sure that if the UPA had announced something similar, the whole Namo bhakt army would have disbelieved them, until they provided further proof.

&gt;Finally, is there any evidence that the Army can provide that you will not dismiss off hand? I mean they would at most be releasing a few grainy photos or shaky video.

That should be good enough.

&gt;Pakistani Army - that bastion of truth and professionalism - would probably dismiss that too as fake. Wonder what you would believe then?

Depends on the evidence India provides.

8,"The US government has neither confirmed nor denied the operation. Nowhere does he say that India *did not* do the strikes. A wise policy, as they cannot possibly know all the details and may be unsure what India wants to reveal. And since when did we start taking the word of US govt anyway? Iraq War? Vietnam War? Coups in South America. Historically, they have been less reliable than anyone. Once again for arbitrary reasons you believe in the word of less reliable institutions over the DGMO.

&gt;At least they provided that.

Once again, that proved nothing, that is what I said and you have not countered it. You basically took the word of a Pakistani general and an institution that has been discredited many times, a fact that you have apparently not taken into account before believing their ""proof"". And I presume you agree with this view (that they have no credibility) as you have not voiced any opinion counter to it. So, to reiterate you take the word of an institution that is unreliable and duplicitous by your own definition. Which makes me wonder what proof are you looking for? Since you do not care about the source or the authenticity of the information. Which brings me to:

&gt;That should be good enough.

Unlikely, since you are not looking for evidence and most certainly do not care about it.

&gt; Depends on the evidence India provides.

Lol. Since, Pakistan has provided a guided tour with no independent investigations allowed why are you waiting for video footage from Indian forces? Why not be satisfied with a power point presentation?

&gt;Touchy baba. 

Not really. I am trying to say that you are being guided by your bias and not by any need to see some evidence as you claim on the forum since you are willing to believe the Pakistani Army over the Indian Army for no good reason. When both these have only held press conferences and not provided any concrete proof and the Pak Army has a questionable track record compared to the Indian Army, at least as far as lying to the international community is concerned.

&gt; If the current regime is saying that it has done something, it has to provide proof for it. I am pretty sure that if the UPA had announced something similar, the whole Namo bhakt army would have disbelieved them, until they provided further proof.

Would there have been doubters? Yes. BTW there was an operation where soldiers went across the border and bought back a few heads as revenge for similar attacks on Indian Jawans. This was widely believed at the time. The difference has been that the Indian Army struck at multiple places simultaneously and deeper than usual and orders to conduct such raids came from top, rather than a local commander organizing a raid for revenge and regimental *izzat*. As for Congress, Chidambaram is now claiming that strikes happened in their time too, but conveniently they have no proof either.
