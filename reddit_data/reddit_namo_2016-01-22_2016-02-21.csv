1,I was sceptic of his fan club even though I voted for one corrupt fuck for Namo. Level of political discourse is gone down due to these assholes.,2016-01-24 17:24:58

3,"In 2014, there was nothing but politics and elections. It was shit back then too. People were calling each other names. The Namo Army was vote brigading. /u/modi4pm aka /u/namo4pm aka /u/Chief_Plato aka /u/yekyen was wreaking havoc on this sub. He was able to troll 20k redditors at the same time. Some guy (/u/Hindustaani, I think) made /u/AAPUnite and starting some weird shit that got that sub banned later on. Looking back, it was fun.",2016-01-25 15:48:56
4,"It doesn't matter. In current scenario if we had presidential system nothing would change . 

BJP is sole ruling party in center and NaMo is pretty much uncontested. 

We need to make sure, people pay more attention to local elections (to elect CM and Municipal Corporation ) than central .",2016-01-26 04:41:43
5,"Kya baat hai /r/india? 

I lived and studied for a little bit in your amazing country a few years back. That was probably the most thrilling year in my short life. Nothing I've visited since has ever topped the beauty of Ladakh, of Kashmir, or of Kerala's backwaters, in my humble opinion. I've made a few great friends while there, and still keep in touch with them. Would love to go back to visit, or eventually work there for a bit. I need to practice my Hindi first though. I try to stay connected to the quite fascinating political life there, but since NaMo's election I haven't been able to keep myself updated as much (less time on my hands).


Also a broad question for y'all, how do you envision the future of the North-Eastern states? Has there been notable improvements there in terms of development and security there since NaMo became the PM? Is AFSPA still in application in most states there, and if yes is it a topic for debate?

Have some mughlai chicken with lachha paratha for me. And a lovely evening

Edit: And a Happy Republic Day as well! ",2016-01-26 22:08:16

7,"&gt; No,the hue and cry for me is that a person who wrote off the awards given by people he did not support few years ago is now so merrily accepting it because of the mutual support the present awardgivers and him have for each other.

Huh..? Why shouldnt it give him joy that those whom he considers to be his peers recognize and honor his talent. I mean, I dont think govt. awards are all that, but if NaMo were to recognize me for my reddit commenting career, I would be absolutely thrilled! 

Unless you think that the repository of wisdom is exclusively with the left and I have no right to be thrilled by recognition from those whom I respect, I fail to see what your argument is. ",2016-01-29 23:26:30

&gt; * While there are many factors in India's technological emergence, smartphones -- cheap ones, in particular -- are chief among them.

&gt; * In 2015, smartphone sales in India eclipsed those in the US for the first time ever, according to Counterpoint Research.

&gt; * With over 400 million Indian citizens now online, the Internet and Mobile Association of India estimates, the country is second only to China.

21,"&gt; Modiji JNU students are performance artists :P

Haha. How about the Art students at the Film and Television Institute of India?

Namo is the top con artist who successfully fooled and still manages to fool so many crores of people. Indeed, art has no limit just like his hypocrisy. I bet this statement was handed over by his PR staff and he simply approved it. I suspect the choice of word ""can't"" over ""doesn't"" was totally unintentional and an oversight.",2016-02-13 21:26:28

Anything against Sri Sri NaMo/RSS/BJ Party/Sri Sri Amit Shahji/what have you is 'abuse of free speech' and 'anti-national' and 'evul sickular libtard' or whatever neologism they've thought of (and god forbid you have received even a paisa in government funding, though strangely this wasn't applicable when MMS was PM).

Apparently no one got the message that free speech has to be completely free, or it is not free speech, it is simply greater or lesser degrees of controlled speech. And now... it isn't really lesser.",2016-02-17 12:24:57

&gt;* Long standing difference of opinion with party on MANUSMIRITI and Rohith Vermula incident.

&gt;* Whosoever responsible for that act must be punished as per the law but the way NDA government tackling the whole issue, the oppression on Professors, repeated lawyer attacks on Media and Kanhaiya kumar in court premises is unjustifiable and we think there is a difference between interrogation and crushing ideology and branding entire left as Anti-national.

&gt;* JNU is considered as one of the progressive and democratic institution where we can see intermingling of people from lower to upper income strata of the society, notion of equality.

&gt;* which has legitimized the action of right wing fascist forces either in Patiala house court or in front of JNU north gate.

&gt;* Anti-India slogans cant be tolerated in campus or any part of country, JNUSU&amp; some left organization are saying that nothing has happened in the campus but here we want to stress that veiled persons in the event organized by former DSU persons shouted slogans BHARAT TERE TUKADDE HONGE of which there is concrete evidence in videos, so we demand any person responsible for the slogans should be punished as per the law, and in this whole process we also condemn media trial which has culminated in Anti-JNU sentiments throughout the country.
