**Student with ‚ÄòIndian-occupied Kashmir‚Äô in Twitter bio seeks Sushma Swaraj‚Äôs help; no place like that, she says** 

 ______ 
A medical student from Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir in Philippines who thought he was
scoring a point by listing his location as ‚ÄúIndian occupied Kashmir‚Äù on
Twitter discovered the perils of doing so when he ran into trouble, and sought
the help of the external affairs minister who respon-ded saying there is no
place called Indian-occupied Kashmir.

Sheikh Ateeq, whose Twitter handle was @SAteEQ019, requested Swaraj to help
him get a new passport and said he needed one to get back to his ‚Äúhome, India‚Äù
as his health was deteriorating.

‚ÄúI am from J&amp;amp;K doing medicine course here in Philippines my passport got
damaged I applied for new one 1 month ago I request u pls help me to get it as
i literally need to go home for medical checkup ,‚Äù Ateeq tweeted on Thursday.
He had asked Swaraj for help earlier, on April 5.

Ateeq has now deleted his Twitter profile (Twitter)

‚ÄúDear ma‚Äôam @SushmaSwaraj I greatly need your help. Is there anything u can do
to rush the process of my passport as it is damaged. I need to get back to my
home, India. My health is deteriorating and I cannot shoulder the expenses any
more as I‚Äôm student (sic),‚Äù he said earlier.

Swaraj, who actively addresses people‚Äôs concerns on Twitter, replied to Ateeq
on Thursday saying she would have helped him had he belonged to Jammu and
Kashmir, and that there was no place called Indian-occupied Kashmir.

Ateeq‚Äôs tweet from April. (Twitter)

Soon after, Ateeq corrected the location on his Twitter bio to ‚ÄúJammu
&amp;amp;kashmir/ Manila‚Äù.

Swaraj acknowledged the correction in a tweet that was shared minutes later
and asked the Indian envoy in Manila, Jaideep Mazumdar, to help the student.
‚ÄúI am happy you have corrected the profile. Jaideep - He is an Indian national
from J&amp;amp;K. Pls help him,‚Äù the minister wrote.

&gt; If you are from J&amp;amp;K state, we will definitely help you. But your profile
says you are from 'Indian occupied Kashmir'. There is no place like that.

&gt;

&gt; ‚Äî Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) May 10, 2018

Swaraj‚Äôs tweets had been shared over 6,700 times and liked by nearly 15,000
people as of 5 pm. Ateeq had deleted his Twitter profile. Swaraj, with 11.7
million Twitter followers, often makes the effort to respond to tweets.

‚ÄúShe wants a personal touch in the messages and often drafts her own
response,‚Äù an aide to the minister said on condition of anonymity.

There are many instances of Swaraj helping Indian in distress by issuing
instructions to officials on Twitter.

In March, after a man wrote to her that his brother had been kidnapped in
Serbia and the kidnappers were threatening to kill him unless ransom was paid,
Swaraj tweeted that she had come to know from the Indian ambassador in
Belgrade that the brother ‚Äúhas been found and is in safe custody of Serbian
authorities.‚Äù

In November 2017, Swaraj came to the aid of the son of a Dubai-based Pakistani
national, who had to undergo open heart surgery for a rare heart defect. After
being turned down by doctors in Pakistan and Dubai, the family applied for
Indian visas and on Twitter approached the minister, who arranged for the
travel documents to be given to them.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised Swaraj, saying she and her ministry
had set an example of effectively using social media to deliver good
governance.

‚ÄúSocial media has become very powerful. I am also connected with it. But the
external affairs ministry and Sushma Swaraj have set the best example of how a
department can be strengthened through its use,‚Äù Modi said in his address to
the Indian diaspora during a June 2017 community event in Virginia.

**48 months vs 48 years: Tagline for government's 4th anniversary to target Congress** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Setting the narrative for 2019 general election, the

Narendra Modi

government will project the works done during its 48 months at the Centre so
far, pitting it against the ‚Äò48-year rule by the Gandhi family‚Äô. Sources said
‚Äú48 months versus 48 years‚Äù will be the tagline for the fourth anniversary
celebrations of the Modi dispensation.

‚ÄúOne family either directly or indirectly ruled the country for 48 years,‚Äù
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in February while addressing a public
meeting in Puducherry while referring to the governments of Jawaharlal Nehru,
Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.

The tagline will be significant in the context of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs statement
that he could become the next PM.

Sources said while the government will highlight the works done in the past
four years and its ‚Äòno-corruption‚Äô track record, it will attack large-scale
corruption during the

UPA

rule.

Another focus area will be the campaign to electrify every house after it has
achieved the target of providing electricity connection to all villages.
Highways ministry‚Äôs achievement to push road construction to 28 km a day and
free gas connection to the poor under Ujjawala scheme will be some of the
major highlights of the anniversary report card.

TOI has learnt that each ministry will prepare small video clips of
achievements and carry out publicity campaign. All ministers in the Modi
cabinet will visit different states and will hold press conferences to
disseminate the Centre‚Äôs achievements.

As reported by TOI on Sunday, the government will also put the number of jobs
created during its four-year in office to counter Congress‚Äô claim of rise in
joblessness.

And don't remind me the number of times people expected Modi to come forward during moments of grief and fear like the lynchings, rapes and violence against Dalits and he has come up short in all of them.

These 4 years have given Modi so many opportunities to rise above party lines, communal thoughts and truly establish himself as the leader to beckon but he gave his party and supporters the first thought.

**Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi Among 10,000 Guests For Lalu Yadav Son Wedding** 

 ______ 
Lalu Yadav was received by his family at the airport and driven straight home.
(PTI)

**Patna: **

Lalu Yadav had

missed his son Tej Pratap Yadav's engagement

ceremony last month. The 69-year-old veteran politician, serving time for the
fodder scam in the 1990s, reached home in Patna late on Thursday evening on a
three-day parole to let him attend his eldest son's wedding later this week.

Tej Pratap Yadav

is to marry Aishwarya Roy

, the daughter of six-time Rashtriya Janata Dal lawmaker Chandrika Roy and a
cabinet colleague of Lalu Yadav in many governments. The young couple had
exchanged rings in the presence of some 200 guests at a Patna hotel.

The wedding is at a much larger scale at the city's veterinary grounds. A
member of the Yadav household said the guest list runs into several thousand -
another suggested it could touch 10,000 - and includes top political leaders
from across the country. Friends as well as political rivals alike.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who ended his party's grand alliance with Lalu
Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Party and the Congress, is expected to set aside
their political rivalry and make it to the wedding. So will Deputy Chief
Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, the senior BJP leader

who played an instrumental role

to get central agencies probe Lalu Yadav, sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi and
daughter Misra Bharti.

When

Sushil Kumar Modi hosted a reception

for his son's marriage, Lalu Yadav had made it a point to show up and

spend two hours to bless the newly-weds

. Mr Modi is

expected to reciprocate

that gesture.

But Lalu Yadav, who was received by his family at the airport and driven
straight home, will have to be careful not to violate parole conditions
imposed by the jailors.

In Patna, Lalu Yadav will have to stay home or the venue of the wedding and
has been banned from speaking to the media, his party supporters or make any
political statement. If he does, he can be hauled right away back to Ranchi's
Birsa Munda central jail.

""Lalu has been released on parole with his hands and feet tied,"" Rashtriya
Janata Dal's Shivanand Tiwary had complained when he heard about the tough
conditions. Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi promptly hit back,
reminding him and other RJD supporters that the conditions had been imposed
for good reason. Former chief minister Lalu Yadav has been convicted in four
corruption cases.

Lalu Yadav didn't appear to mind the conditions as he stepped into his house
on Thursday evening, his grandchildren more than making up for the absence of
slogan-shouting party workers. ""Nanaji zindabad (Long Live grandfather),"" they
shouted.

__ Comments

Not that he really had a choice.

The RJD chief

has spent more than four months

in Birsa Munda jail following his conviction in multiple cases of the fodder
scam and he has a long way to go. In March, the judge who pronounced him
guilty in the scam ordered that he serve two jail terms of seven years. It was
the fourth case in which he had been held guilty and the courts are yet to
decide a few more cases.

A reading (and not arithmetical) mistake led to the company's reserves being stated as + rather than - but this was inconsequential to the story and corrected and noted as such. Due to the injunction, I cannot go into the details of the story but in his pleadings, Jay Amit Shah has not been able to point out any factual inaccuracy in the story. That is a matter of record.¬†

2 - You can read my answer to Shalini Singh's accusation in the same site where you read her accusation. Nothing more needs to be said. It is a matter of record that the only newspapers to follow the Vadra story while Manmohan Singh was still in power were The Hindu, under my editorship, and Business Standard. Shalini Singh and Chander Suta Dogra extensively reported the story.

I am not the best qualified to comment on N. Ram's characterisations but these references have nothing to do with Vadra. We know from an interview N. Ravi, my successor gave, that he was unhappy with The Hindu's coverage of Narendra Modi during my editorship. Some board members were also unhappy at my withdrawal of a long-standing editorial instruction at the Hindu that all statements by Subramanian Swamy, Prakash Karat and Subbirami Reddy be automatically reported. I insisted that these be reported only if they were genuinely newsworthy.

3 - She and another reporter were pushed out of the room of a dalit student by a group of activists who also, according to her email to me, threatened to file a complaint under the SC/ST Act. My advice to her was to file the story she had gone to report (about the alleged discriminatory treatment of a Dalit) as objectively as possible and not make herself part of the story.¬†

On the issue of going to the police to file a complaint, this is what I wrote to her: ‚ÄúMy sense is to not bother with any formal police¬†complaint¬†because they will almost certainly follow it up with a¬†complaint¬†of their own and nothing will come out of it except a lot of your time getting wasted.‚Äù

Net-net, I think this was eminently sensible advice. I cannot speak about what other editors advised her, leftists or otherwise.

4 - I had heard all the tapes because we covered Radia extensively at The Hindu, where I was deputy chief of bureau and then bureau chief at the time. I went back and refreshed my memory of the conversation you refer to. It is what it is: a request to Tata's PR person for someone from Tata/L&amp;T to appear for a¬† a TV interview. What is the issue there? Actually Venu says nothing much about what will be asked. But in any case, when you schedule an interview, you do not reveal your actual hand.

I should also add that Outlook, which first tried to implicate MK Venu in the Radia scandal, had to finally issue an apology:

**My mother is more Indian than many Indians, says Rahul** 

 ______ 
BENGALURU: It was one of the most telling comments of rock-solid support that
former

Congress

president

Sonia Gandhi

got on attacks on her foreign origin, when

AICC

chief

Rahul Gandhi

said his mother was ‚Äúmore Indian than many Indians‚Äù.

Winding up his high decibel poll campaign in

Karnataka

on Thursday, Rahul, accompanied by all top Congress leaders, interacted with
the media here and responded to issues on rising incidents of crime against
women, his visits to temples and personal attacks on Siddaramaiah and him by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the election campaign. ‚ÄúDo you like the
tone of the attacks? Do you appreciate it?‚Äù he asked.

To a query on Modi‚Äôs challenge asking him to ‚Äúspeak in his mother tongue‚Äù,
Rahul said: ‚ÄúYes, my mother is Italian, but she has lived a large part of her
life in India. She is more Indian than many Indians I see.‚Äù Stating that it
shows the calibre of the PM when he makes such comments, he maintained, ‚ÄúMy
mother has sacrificed for this country, she has suffered for it. I‚Äôm happy to
let him do so. If he enjoys himself, if he likes it.‚Äù

On Modi‚Äôs allegation that the Congress, fearing defeat, may rig elections,
Rahul said, ‚ÄúA man speaks what‚Äôs in his heart‚Äù, suggesting that the PM had
already accepted defeat. ‚ÄúHe is absolutely convinced now, and he is right,
that he is going to lose Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan
and also in 2019.‚Äù

He described the army of Union ministers campaigning in Karnataka by spelling
out the word ‚Äòpanic‚Äô. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve panicked because they‚Äôre noticing, and
realising, that the Congress is doing things differently. The Congress showed
them what it‚Äôs capable of in Gujarat and now my party has clearly demonstrated
what it‚Äôs capable of in Karnataka. We don‚Äôt want a barrage of leaders from
outside the state to come and fight for us.‚Äù

He ruled out a suggestion that this election was a run-up to the 2019 polls,
and of him being the PM candidate. ‚ÄúThis election is about the spirit of
Karnataka. This state has given our country so much, when I hear that
Bengaluru is the second Silicon Valley, I feel proud. I‚Äôm absolutely convinced
that 5 to 10 years from today, the people of Silicon Valley will come and say
we‚Äôre the second Silicon Valley, and Bengaluru is the first,‚Äù he added.

Rahul clarified that his party was not politicising atrocities against women
and rapes, but maintained that it was a national issue. On BJP calling him an
‚ÄòElection Hindu‚Äô for visiting places of worship, he said: ‚ÄúBJP doesn‚Äôt
understand the term ‚ÄòHindu‚Äô. It‚Äôs a perspective. It‚Äôs something which lives
with you.‚Äù

On repeated attacks on him by the PM, Rahul narrated a story of Buddha. He
said many years ago, when Buddha was sitting with his disciple, a person came
and started abusing him. After the person left, the disciple asked Buddha why
he did not respond to the abuse. Buddha replied that the man had brought him
the gift of anger, which he did not want.

‚ÄúModi has anger inside him. He has anger for everybody, not only for me. I‚Äôm a
lightning rod of that anger, I attract that anger. He sees a threat in me,‚Äù he
added.

I talk by statistics, not by reading stuff on Facebook like you.

PS. Most senior leaders of both BJP and Congress are lawyers, something that irks me too, but it is how it is.

Btw, Pranab Mukherjee (UPA finance minister in case you don't remember) also had a degree in political science and law. No finance background whatsoever.",2018-05-11 13:41:17

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday said he had written to President Ram
Nath Kovind requesting him to donate his one-month salary to the Clean Ganga
Fund (CGF), set up by the government to aid efforts to rid the river of
pollutants.

Speaking to reporters at New Delhi, Gadkari said he would also urge Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, ministers, MPs and MLAs and people to donate their
one-month salary to the CGF, formed to receive voluntary contributions from
individuals and organisations. The government has till now received Rs 250
crore in the CGF after it was approved by the Union Cabinet in September 2014,
he said. Gadkari added at least one crore people should come forward to help
raise fund for the river cleaning efforts, which is high on the government‚Äôs
agenda.

‚ÄúI have written a letter to the President. And after the President, I am also
urging all, the Prime Minister, Ministers, MPs, MLAs and all to donate their
one-month salary to the CGF,‚Äù he told reporters at New Delhi. Gadkari said all
people should join the cause sharing whatever amount they can through digital
transfer. ‚ÄúSome people have donated even Rs 300 per month in the CGF‚Ä¶People
can share Rs 500, Rs 1,000 and whatever amount they want to share,‚Äù he said.

Gadkari stressed there was no shortage of fund for the Namami Gange programme,
which has a non-lapsable provision of Rs 20,000 crore. The minister said that
the government had already signed MoUs with corporate houses in connection
with works such as constructing ghats and roads, installing light and sound
show, developing parking spaces and other purposes. Contributions to the Clean
Ganga Fund enjoy 100 per cent tax exemption.

**India's History, Faith, Lord Ram Incomplete Without Nepal: PM Modi: 10 Points** 

 ______ 
**Janakpur, Nepal: ** After weeks of hectic campaigning in Karnataka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Nepal's Janakpur, known as the birthplace of Goddess Sita. PM Modi and Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli inaugurated a bus service from Janakpur to Ayodhya - known to be Lord Ram's birthplace - to promote religious tourism in Nepal and India. Apart from holding meetings with the Nepal Prime Minister and other leaders during his two-day visit to the Himalayan nation, PM Modi is visiting three Hindu pilgrimage centres in Nepal. This is his third visit to the country as Prime Minister. 

Here is your 10-point cheatsheet to PM Narendra Modi's visit to Nepal:

  1. Addressing a crowd during a reception in Janakpur, PM Modi - who wore a traditional pink turban - said Nepal comes first in India's ""Neighbourhood First"" policy.
  2. PM Modi and his Nepalese counterpart, KP Sharma Oli, jointly inaugurated the Ramayan Circuit Bus Route that connects Janakpur, 225 km from capital Kathmandu, to Ayodhya. ""For centuries the ties between Ayodhya and Janakpur are unbreakable,"" PM Modi said.
  3. ""Without Nepal, India's faith is incomplete. Without Nepal, India's history is incomplete. Without Nepal, India's _dhams_ (temples) are incomplete. Without Nepal, our Ram is incomplete,"" PM Modi said after flagging off the bus.
  4. High security is in place in Janakpur, Kathmandu and Muktinath where PM Modi is visiting. Close to 11,000 security personnel from both countries will be deployed during the visit.
  5. The Indian government has identified 15 destinations in India, including Ayodhya, Nandigram, Hampi and Nagpur for development under the Ramayana Circuit theme.
  6. PM Modi and KP Sharma Oli will hold one-on-one talks in Kathmandu later today. He will also meet the Nepal president, vice president and leaders of major political parties. In Kathmandu, PM Modi will offer prayers at the famous Pashupatinath temple.
  7. The foundation stone for a hydroelectricity project in the eastern Nepal district of Sankhuwasabha will be laid by PM Modi via video conferencing. Indian government-owned Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam is handling the project in Nepal.
  8. Tomorrow, PM Modi will offer prayers at the Muktinath temple, on the foothills of the Thorong La mountain pass. He is expected to announce a ""surprise gift"" for its development .
  9. ""I am confident that my visit will further cement our people-centric partnership with Nepal on the basis of mutual benefit, goodwill and understanding,"" PM Modi said in a statement.
  10. PM Modi's visit comes a month after Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli visited India last month.

**""Have Now Learnt To Deal With The PM"": Rahul Gandhi's All-Out Attack** 

 ______ 
**Bengaluru: **

Congress president Rahul Gandhi said today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi
saw him as a ""threat"" and that was the reason his anger was directed at him.
He also said PM Modi's attack over his comment on the prime minister's post
was aimed at ""distracting attention"".

""This election is not about Rahul. I have now learnt to deal with the prime
minister. When he can't respond, he distracts,"" Rahul Gandhi said.

On Wednesday, PM Modi had, at an election rally in Karnataka, mocked Rahul
Gandhi

over his statement that he was ready to be prime minister

if his party emerged as the single largest in the 2019 national election. Will
the country ever accept such an ""immature and naamdaar (dynast)"" leader for
the top post, the prime minister questioned.

Asked about the ""personal attacks""

, the Congress president referred to a story on the Buddha, who refused to
react to a man shouting and abusing him.

""Buddha said the anger belonged to that man, and he did not accept the abuse,
so it went back to that person,"" Rahul Gandhi said.

""Modi has anger inside.

He has anger for everybody, not just me....and he sees a threat in me,"" he
said.

The Congress president also responded to the BJP calling him an ""election
Hindu"" for visiting temples and other places of worship in the middle of his
campaign.

PM Modi had mocked Rahul Gandhi over his statement that he was ready to be
prime minister

""The BJP gets uncomfortable when I go to a temple...I don't think BJP
understands the term Hindu,"" said Rahul Gandhi.

""Throughout last 15 years, I've been visiting temples, mosques, gurudwaras,
every religious institution I come across. BJP doesn't like this. I don't
think they understand the meaning of the term Hindu. It's a perspective. It's
something which lives with you throughout,"" he said.

Gandhi said the Modi government had ""decimated"" the country's foreign policy
and that a ""disaster"" was in the making on that front.

__ Comments

The election in Karnataka will be held on May 12 in 223 of the 224
constituencies of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, while the counting of
votes and announcement of results will take place on May 15.

The election for one constituency has been postponed following the death of
B.N. Vijay Kumar, Jayanagar BJP candidate.

78,"Thanks for a genuine answer. My question to you is this. 

The 6+ points you mentioned are as good or meaningful or important as many steps taken by UPA 1 and UPA 2 and Vajpayee before that. GST was not a clear win because of the botched up implementation. So I wont give them full marks on that. Similar toilet construction was carried out by UPA under Nirmal Bharat Scheme. There were plenty of ujjwala bharat type schemes under UPA too. LED bulbs program, if done by UPA, would be called freebie politics by sanghis.

What I am saying is that this govt is as good or bad as other govt.s in the past in terms of execution or implementation of policies.

But this govt. is extremely bad at respecting our institutions, education (JNU, Indian Science Congress, IIT sanskrit research etc), medicine (ministry of ayush homeopathy, gomutra research etc), judiciary...the list is long.

Then comes the attack on our social fabric. Controversy about every damn thing, love jihad, bhagwa vigilantes, dalit violence, Ram Navmi celebration with riots, Jinnah etc. etc. Modi can easily ask his bhakts to stop all this but he does not. He believes it as much as them.

Then comes the lowering of public discourse and control over media. Specially their IT cell which is supervised by Amit Malviya who is super close to Modi himself.

Then comes the grand stupidity of demonetization and saying things like hardwork and harvard. 

Then comes the chest thumping after surgical strikes which resulted in virtually 0 positive results on the ground.

But I want to ask don't you think the balance between the development that is happening and the religious agenda that is spreading, can be much better?

Why is there even a need for such religious hatred when they have such an overwhelming majority and can bring in great policies! The religious agenda is something I expect to come from the opposition parties and not the ruling government. I hope I'm making sense to you? üòÖ

(In 2014 I was extremely hopeful that Modi will bring a huge change in our nation's mindset and we will move ahead rapidly. But now I'm very disappointed and frustrated every time I hear his speeches. It's like he's just making false promises.)

In 2014, when Modiji was campaigning, he strongly put forward his development agenda and religion/caste took a back seat. But in 2019, I can already see us reverting back to religion/caste based speeches at political rallies.

My Dad was not the typical unkill but he did support Modi wholeheartedly in 2014. He too is tired of these antics and no longer thinks Modi is the right guy to lead us for another term. The problem however arises when looking for Modi's alternatives. Nobody looks remotely prepared enough. Its almost like a walkover.

91,"When Modi came into power in 2014, I was very hopeful to see how his government will change India as the previous governments have been nothing but crooks. They looted so much from India that we were driven into a state of economic paralysis. This new government came and assured everyone that they will change everything about India. Although most of the ministers in BJP are biased and Sanghis, some of them are actually focused on the work that they are supposed to do. Within 4 years India's international status rose to a powerful position. And not only that the Government became more transparent. The people too are more involved and vocal about it. This new government made Politics a trend. The welfare of the country became more open and people more aware. I like that about this government. About the things that most people don't like about this Government like the reforms, changes in policies, Inflation and more. At first, I thought it was because India had been screwed over so much by the previous governments it needs a push. But after 4 years some of the things have become questionable. The world today has eyes on India. This new government made sure that we stay in focus and also stay on top of several economic changes to attract more FDI. That will also enhance businesses in India. Allow for more jobs, wealth, capital investments etc. But the current state have been questionable and also where is all this reform going? What are the immediate benefits and what are the long term benefits? I am not sure about voting for Modi again until they are answered. And maybe there is no hope for India, maybe Modi is just like every other Politician that has conned Indian Population. But at least it's maybe for Modi, for everyone else we know they are corrupt con\-men who are just gonna loot again.

I completely disagree, go to places like Kankariya Lake, Lal Darwaja, Riverfront you will find people from every caste enjoying their time. you are saying like this if they ask caste certificate from visiting people.

&gt; In Ahmedabad itself, you can see the divide very clearly. 

Agree.

&gt;  First of all Muslims are ghettoized in the old city, which is a shithole compared to rest of Ahmedabad.

I disagree here if you are talking about only lal darawaja side than you are wrong. Muslims are in many areas like Juhapura, Lal Darwaja, Vatwa and many more. And it's not anyone 's fault. you see we have developed a society where most of the people want to live only where their caste of people are in majority that's why Muslims are in one area and Hindus are in the different area.

&gt;All the swanky roads, nice parks and other shining civic facilities are only in the Hindu Area.

I also somewhat disagree here, have you seen roads in Lal-Darwaja, Juhapura or Vatwa ?(in Vatwa roads are somewhat bad), also other civic facilities like hospitals, schools, electricity and water supply are same as other areas. The point you mentioned about parks, yes I agree I haven't seen any park in Muslim areas also Parks in other areas are not much. also now a days parks are being made on open canal system, but I also haven't seen open canals in Muslim area as everything is now underground in Ahmedabad.

&gt;Modi is so shameless that 2002 riots survivors have been rehabilitated in colonies which are situated next to the City's garbage dump.

I can't say about this because I have limited knowledge about 2002, but as you mentioned garbage dump there are only factories there, imo the people you have mentioned leaves near the garbage dump not next to it.

&gt;And when some families have refused to shift, they have been blamed for not taking government help

also can't tell you on this without looking at context, but imo they should have take government's help.",2018-05-11 16:45:45
94,"I will vote for BJP in the coming elections. Not because I have any affection towards BJP or hatred against congress as entities, but because of the people in charge. I am going to vote for Narendra Modi's leadership and work and I am not going to vote for Gandhi/Nehru family dynasty, who have already got more than enough chances in independent India. I remember the gloom during UPA's previous rule for a decade. The country was in shambles, the image of the nation suffered domestically and internationally, the only news was how much corruption could one minister manage one after another, the prices were uncontrollable, the bureaucrats had no incentive to work, etc etc. 

I understand people hate bjp for its ideology, nationalism/hyper nationalism, too much focus on vedic science, provoking comments from MLAs/MPs/leaders, hindu muslim  debates, etc. However, the point remains is that these things are not exclusive to bjp. All the parties have their own idiotic tales of the above and variations of it. They have their own agenda of vote bank politics. They have divided the nation on all fronts. Hence, none of the parties pass on these fronts.

The only factor I find it necessary to differentiate the parties is development of the nation. In the last four years, I have seen the development all around the country. The bureaucrats have never been so much focused and functional, sanitation and cleanliness had never been so important, power, railways, bank strengthening, infrastructure development, focus on education quality, focus on psu development, basic amenities, north east development,  etc had never been there. 

Still, if somebody had asked me to vote for a bjp led by, say, advani, I would not have done so, because ultimately my concern is not a party or a person, but an entire unit as a whole and this is the reason I will vote for a bjp led by modi. I may have voted congress if I had perceived someone there who seemed more capable than modi. Do you really think I will vote for a gandhi dynast again? What has rahul gandhi done so far? He has not able to develop amethi till now and has no experience in handling affairs. I could care less he is a gandhi because the name is not enough to lead a nation like India. If congress discards gandhi dynasty, and chooses a leader capable enough, people will surely think about it seriously. What are the other options then? Mamata? Sharad pawar? Akhilesh? Mayawati? Lalu? Owaisi? Sorry to say, none of them have done anything much for the development of their state to consider them for the PM post. Ultimately, it's about the best choice available and in the current scenario there is nobody else who has the trust than a BJP led by Modi.

But Gujarat lacks in many key social areas like very few good university (no one knows of any state universities outside Gujarat except may be MS), health care is mostly private, environment is also deteriorating due to the industrial waste being dumped directly in the gulf which is almost dead now.

When you're ragged in boarding school by Muslim teenagers who make you denounce your god and make you read Quran it's inevitable to develop negative feelings towards the religion. I was born Hindu but I'm an atheist. I don't really care about my religion / ""my god"". But I've developed this hatred towards that particular religion and it'll never go away
3) I don't know how one can argue BJP is the only party that creates communal divides. All politicians and all parties do it. ""But they do more"" argument may be true. But it doesn't convince me enough
4) My selfish reason - This government has been good for my business. Yes it has negatively affected others. But it's been good for mine.

116,"As the handle would suggest, I'm definitely gonna vote for BJP in the coming election and the reasons are as follows -

These are just my opinions and considering the generally anti-modi/anti-BJP rhetoric here, I'll not be replying to any replies to this comment. Feel free to downvote this to oblivion, I could care less.

1. For all the hate modi has gotten for demonetisation, I still believe that the intent behind it was good. The country definitely needs to get rid of the informal economy and get more people in the formal economy for the betterment of the entire country. Someone needs to do something about black money, agreed that demonetisation's implementation wasn't good but the very fact that he is willing to take a broad level reform to clean up the informal economy is enough to earn my vote.

2. I'm still a big believer in the Gujarat model. You can post articles about how the Gujarat model maybe a lie blah blah but I could care less. I have seen first hand how Gujarat's GDP has grown at the same rate as some of our more prosperous neighbours like South Korea, Taiwan etc for a decently long period of time under Modi's watch. Poverty has been eradicated to quite a significant extent and I personally believe that the Gujarat model needs to be replicated on a pan India basis if this country is to go anywhere.

3. The country has been subjected to significant harm thanks to Congress' socialism and communism like approach. Vajpayee's 1990's economic reforms is the only reason why India is even where it is right now. Had those reforms not been put in place, I would still be waiting for probably a decade to get a 64kbps narrowband line from BSNL and wouldn't even be writing this comment right now. Capitalism is the way forward and BJP is the only big capitalism oriented national party in this country.

4. I'm personally quite impressed with modi's large scale infrastructure projects to revamp ports, railway lines and the rapid pace at which he has built roads. India has one of the poorest infrastructure for even an emerging country. If we are ever to become an export superpower like our neighbour China, we definitely need way better ports, power, rail, road etc which modi is already working upon.

5. Corruption has been almost negligible. Please don't post links to rafale or amit shah's company or piyush goyal's company. Those are at best shady business transactions and nowhere close to the 2G scam, coal scam, robert vadara case and what not that happened under the previous government.

Sometimes I feel its better and easier to succeed here being a lower caste citizen.

I want all citizens to be treated equal - I am not happy with all the news around and I feel government hasnt done enough to ensure this

2) GST -
Real benefit of GST is yet to come  I want to use all the data and ensure people are paid right amount of taxes. I am seeing a lots of businesses struggling since they never paid taxes before. I want government to do all data crunching and get the last drop of tax from non tax paying millionaires.

3) Infrastructure-
I hate the current unnecessarily waste.of money on statues and I am looking for good investment on infrastructure. I live in Mumbai and city is choked with traffic and pathetic roads but the incompetent Mh govt isnt doing anythimg.
 
If I see improvement in above fields I may vote for Modi else NOTA is the way to go. Will never vote for congress since they are also a scum to a larger extent and if they come to power I am expecting reservations to increase and half the money going to corruption.",2018-05-11 20:25:51

**PM Modi Targeted With 'The Lie Lama' Posters, Delhi Cops Launch Lookout** 

 ______ 
Posters with PM Narendra Modi's photo and reading ""The Lie Lama"" were seen in
Delhi this week.

**New Delhi: **

Black-and-white posters with red text plastered across Delhi sent the police
scrambling into action on Thursday, taking many of them down and registering a
case against unidentified people. ""The Lie Lama"", the posters read over a
monochrome photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with folded hands. The police
have registered a case of vandalism and ""confiscated"" a poster in central
Delhi's Mandir Marg area.

__ Comments

The police have received complaints about the posters from several areas in
central Delhi which fall under the New Delhi Municipal Council or NDMC besides
Model Town and Moti Nagar. The posters were also widely shared on social media
in the last few days, accusing PM Narendra Modi of making false promises.

&gt; \- suman sengupta (@sumonseng) May 10, 2018

Leaders and members of the BJP have objected to the posters. Acting on the
complaints, the police registered the case last night after removing them from
a wall in Mandir Marg's J-Block area. They say the posters don't have the name
of any printing establishment on them. Since the posters were put up on
government property, the police registered a case under the defacement law
against unknown people. Local residents would be questioned to ascertain the
identity of the people behind the act, they said.

Some social media users on Friday noted that many of the posters were taken
down after the police case was registered.

**Nepal comes first in India's Neighbourhood First policy: Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

today assured

Nepal

that it is at the top of

India

's Neighbourhood First policy as he announced a Rs 100 crore package to
develop Janakpur - the sacred city for Hindus - while invoking mythological
links between the two countries.

Speaking at a civic reception by the Janakpur Sub-Metropolitan City at
Barhabigha ground here, Modi briefly spoke in Nepali and Maithili.

He began his address by chanting ""Jay Siya Ram"" slogan three times.

In a speech that invoked mythological references and symbolism, Modi said he
has come to Janakpur not as the prime minister but as the chief pilgrim, amid
applause.

Modi, who is on his third visit to Nepal since assuming office in 2014, read
out a verse from Ramcharitmanas which says 'one cannot remain isolated from
the suffering of a friend and a true friend always helps his friend in the
time of suffering.'

""Whenever there has been a problem, India and Nepal have stood together. We
have been there for each other in the most difficult of times,"" said Modi,
whose voice appeared hoarse apparently due to his hectic campaign in Karnataka
assembly elections.

Modi assured Nepal that it is at the top of India's Neighbourhood First
policy. He announced a Rs. 100 crore package for the development of Janakpur
and its surrounding areas. The amount will be spent on different development
projects forging collaboration between the central government and the local
government of Province No. 2.

Janakpur is known as the birth

place

of Sita, the wife of Lord Rama.

Modi, who earlier with his Nepalese counterpart K P Sharma Oli jointly
inaugurated a direct bus service between Janakpur and

Ayodhya

\- the two sacred cities for Hindus, said he was happy to link Janakpur with

Ramayan Circuit

.

""This circuit will develop religious tourism. It also will strengthen
connectivity between the two nations,"" Modi said.

He also announced that two other circuits will also be developed for the
promotion of the areas related to Buddhism and Jain religion in both Nepal and
India, which will be instrumental in generating employment for the youths.

Modi said Nepal and India can benefit if they cooperate and work together for
the promotion of five Ts: Tradition, Trade, Tourism, Technology and Transport.
He underlined the need for linking Nepal and India through highway, I- way or
Information, Railway, Trans way or electric connectivity, waterway and airway.

""Better connectivity leads to enhanced India-Nepal friendship. That is why
topmost priority is being given to boosting connectivity,"" he said.

""We are also trying our best to connect Nepal with waterways so that Nepal
will be able to export Nepali goods abroad. If done so Nepal will be able to
reap benefits through international trade,"" Modi said.

He said his long cherished dream to visit Janakpur has now been fulfilled with
the grace of Goddess Sita.

Modi, who earlier offered special prayers at the famed 20th century Janaki
temple, invoked mythological King Janak of Mithila and King Dashratha of
Ayodhya and said they not only united Janakpur and Ayodhya but also united
India and Nepal.

""Nepal and India relations were started during the rule of King Janak in Treta
Yuga and the bondage built by Sita during the period is still strong. It is
this bondage which attracts people from Rameswaram to Pashupatinath, people
from Lumbini to Bodhgaya and I was also attracted with the same bondage,"" he
said.

He said Nepal and India not only share border, aspirations, dreams and
destination, but their happiness and challenge are also same.

""Nepal is the land of great sages like Yagyavalkya, Astavakra, Gargi, who used
to debate on theology and social issues in the palace of King Janak,"" he said,
adding that Nepal has become the centre of spiritualism and philosophy.

Janakpur is the land from where the message of women empowerment reverberates,
Modi said, adding that this is also the land which Raja Janak served with
utmost devotion and compassion.

Modi also hailed the three successful polls in Nepal after the promulgation of
the new Constitution in 2015.

He said the strides Nepal has made in strengthening its democratic fabric are
commendable.

Nepal conducted two-phased parliamentary and provincial assembly elections in
November and December 2017. The country also held local elections in three
phases last year.

Modi said India will build a railway link between Raxaul in Bihar and
Kathmandu to facilitate people-to-people contact and movement of goods.

He also thanked Oli and said the honour he received in Janakpur is for the
entire people of India.

Defence Minister Ishwor Pokharel welcomed Prime Minister Modi at the function.
Modi was wearing a Maithili kurta gifted by Prime Minister Oli.

""Nepal and India are tied together by common culture, civilization and
history,"" Pokharel said.

He expressed the confidence that the people to people relations between the
two countries are being nurtured on the basis of brotherhood and equality.

Mayor of Janakpur Sub-metropolitan City Lal Kishro Shah read out felicitation
letter in honour of Modi. He also handed over the symbolic key of Janakpur to
Modi and gifted the picture of Janaki Temple as a token of love to him.

Chief Minister of Province No. 2 Lal Babu Raut offered a huge garland weighing
121 kg to Modi on the occasion.

Welcoming Modi, Chief Minister Raut said the ""open borders between Nepal and
India have been instrumental in connecting the peoples of the two countries.""

His mother had famously called Modi ""maut ka saudagar"" which had backfired for Congress in 2007 Gujarat election.

As for the recent Gujarat election, BJP won and also increased its vote share despite facing 20 years of anti-incumbency and Modi not being the CM candidate. Congress lost despite funding the agitations by Hardik and Mevani.

135,"I'm most probably going to choose NOTA or AAP in 2019. But I do understand why a lot of sane people may be convinced to vote for the BJP apart from the anti-Muslim/anti-Pakistan rhetoric, and SOME points I can understand (before the edgy teens here lynch me let me clarify, I absolutely hate the BJP and the Hindutva agenda, as you may see if you scroll through my past comments on this sub). 

1. The absence of a strong left-wing party in India. Lets be honest. Rahul Gandhi is a fucking dumbass. What I fail to understand is WHY the Congress has still kept him as their presidential candidate when everyone in the country knows he's a meme. Meanwhile, CPI is too left-wing for many people and the AAP is considered by some to be new and inexperienced (personally I think they're the best option currently). In the presence of a tepid rival like Rahul, Modi can become an alluring option. The most common reply I get when I ask a relatively civilized BJP voter ""Why do you want to vote for the BJP"" is ""Who else should I vote for? Pappu?"". They probably feel: Rather than electing an inexperienced, ineffective candidate, its is better to have a strong leader even if its at the cost of anti-minority policies/ hatred. 

2. On some parameters, I think, Modi has done an okay job. Foreign policy, as many experts agree, has been instilled with a long-lost charisma and energy. Economically, too, there has been progress (how much of the credit belongs to Modi, I cannot say). A lot of BJP voters may probably look only at these parameters and draw a conclusion that the country, in general, is making progress.

In order to get Modi out, I believe having a strong rival candidate is one of the most important necessity. We can only hope that one arrives soon. ",2018-05-11 22:43:17
136,"I read Bharat Karnad's book: India's Nuclear Policy.

Thank God we didn't sign the treaty. Even registering for organizations such as the NSG (Nuclear Suppliers Group) seems like a bad idea.

Modi is really caving into American interests. ",2018-05-11 22:45:43
137,"I doubt it's really about Rahul vs Modi - one of the main reasons the UPA fell apart is that the congress already had a very shaky alliance and 2 terms of anti-incumbency had set in. The scams happen and the Anna Hazare movement which started just to be an anti-corruption effort became a proxy for the BJP to get power.

The other thing that we have to acknowledge is that Indian politics has gradually moved away from the idea that an (western) educated intellectual vanguard of elites will lead the country forward. This is the principle on which the INC was founded, and Nehru was it's epitome. The Congress has mostly splintered in a lot of states (WB is a great example of this).

Another thing is that a huge chunk of congress voters - upper caste hindus - have switched over to the BJP. The Sangh has propagated upper caste hindu victimhood for almost half a century, and now people have tasted majoritarianism it's unlikely that it will go away anytime soon.

The congress really has to reform itself to be a viable centrist opposition and get a lot more power on it's own in individual Indian states. If not the congress, somebody else. Because right now in most states the alternative to the BJP is left-wing populist federalist political parties like the SP, BSP, TMC. The AAP has hardly any power outside Delhi.

Ultimately people who are firmly in the sangh loyalist camp have their minds made up. It will take generations for their mindset to change and that will only happen with a lot more education and a significantly higher level of wealth and higher living standards. Maybe. And that too isn't a given. Many middle-income countries are very very conservative.",2018-05-11 22:53:58
138,"Not OP, but i switched side in recent months (if you wanna know why just ask).

‚Ä¢RTE - i think OP explained it in the reply to your comment. I'm sure you get the gist.

‚Ä¢It doesn't bother me. Since, that company (Flipkart) operates in india it is going to profit india and it's not bought by Amazon so the market remains competitive. People think that Flipkart was wholly indian which is widly incorrect since majority of investment was already foreign, so the sale is foreign to foreign. 

The main problem is that is this sale will affect the indian retailers. And, it is a valid concern because you can see how amazon operates. It forces its retailers to reveal its supply chain and then establishes it own to drive them out of business (Cloudtail India). 

Another concern is that the foreign companies have deep pockets and they get loan at very low interest which coupled with cheap indian labour can outcompete any indian company who get loan at high interest.

So, we need somekind of regulation in indian online retailer market.

The last point's logic applies to all other area too therefore FDI is allowed in very few areas in india. That's why walmart doesn't have presence in india and which is why its buying Flipkart.

‚Ä¢ Ahh.. the income inequality question. I can write whole thesis on this. This is the main problem of 21st century. Even america doesn't know what to do with it. [Here's](https://youtu.be/GmRgU2B1pe0)  President Obama talking about it. Republicans shut him up by blaming him of ""Class warfare"". Its funny. [Here's](https://youtu.be/sGz-wF3PviY) why it is not becuase of capitalism as people like you to believe. Focus on the content as the edit is little obnoxious.

‚Ä¢ Yes, people are mad at him for not acknowledging the incident fast enough. We can't definately know what happens in his mind. But, I'll guess that he doesn't acknowledges it because the incident can be proped up bullshit like Judge Loya case (unnecessary implication of conspiracy by congress), kathua rape case (unnecessary politicisation of rape, blaming it on hindu fundamentalism), impeachment of CJI (on no grounds; just to make a statement/oppostion). Well, the UP rape case was genuine, but when everything is proped up just the sake of opposition (the crying wolf story) it's hard to believe if its genuine or not.

Not my own opinion. I genuinely believe that Modi is working for the good of the nation. I'll recommend researching the opposite side of any argument without any bias (if possible). I did the same. I hated him too. But, what i lacked was perspective and proper history to appreciate his efforts. 

Yes, i agree at grassroot level some MPs are corrupt but that's necessary sacrifice for winning election(which every party does). That's the reality of our elections. His approach is pragmatic not idealism.

Yes, BJP wants to unite Hindu bloc but that doesn't meant that everyone else have to suffer. Till now every party ignored the Hindu bloc 'coz they were divided and it is easier to unite and convince them to vote for them. Muslims in Congress rule didn't progress at all. There progress is even worse than dalits ([Report](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachar_Committee&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzw-zmk_7aAhXLv48KHV-CBicQFjAAegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yVxkRkKPIeO5ynQpb4loJ)).

‚Ä¢ German model of Schooling with Japanese primary school model.

‚Ä¢ Judiciary reforms. ( To clear crores of pending cases.)

‚Ä¢ Cutbacks in Indian army. ( 80% of budget is used in maintaining the army. Nothing (10-15%) for modernization. China, America is doing the same.)

‚Ä¢ Police reforms at grass root level.

‚Ä¢ Incentives for states to create job and competition between themselves. Establishing better stats collection using different parameters form bottom-up (panchayat- small city- district-... Etc) to get better accessment of ground realities.

170,"&gt; For all the hate modi has gotten for demonetisation, I still believe that the intent behind it was good.

Unless you are a mind reader, you cannot conclude the nature of the intent behind it. 

In any case, having good intentions is the *bare minimum* that any government is expected to do. The BJP doesn't get any credit for clearing such a low bar. What a govt *should* get credit for is if they think through their actions, plan them out, and are *effective*. That's what matters. The fact that BJP fanboys are reducing to resorting to *intentions* rather than *results* speaks volumes about the results themselves. 


&gt; Someone needs to do something about black money, agreed that demonetisation's implementation wasn't good but the very fact that he is willing to take a broad level reform to clean up the informal economy is enough to earn my vote.

Demonetisation was not a failure from an implementation perspective. The idea itself is monumentally idiotic, and the fact that so many people believe it coule be even a *plausible* solution to black money is a scathing indictment of our education system and shows how much we lack in the critical thinking department. 


&gt; Vajpayee's 1990's economic reforms is the only reason why India is even where it is right now.

Alas, WhatsApp University is not a reliable source of history knowledge. Economic reforms were started by the INC under PVNR with MMS as the Finance Minister. Vajpayee of course continued it, but giving all the credit to him without acknowledging that the process began several years before he became PM is simply disingenuous.


&gt; Corruption has been almost negligible

*Reports* of corruption have been negligible. That's not the same thing as not being corrupt. That's the same fallacy as thinking that Somalia is safer for women than Sweden because fewer rape cases are reported in Somalia.

Especially when the govt has been weakening whistleblower protection laws, failing to respond to RTIs, it is expected that corruption reports will come down. Also, this is the govt that, to save itself from legal action, made it *retrospectively legal since the 1970s* for political parties to take *foreign money*. That means that this party has, in violation of the law, *been taking foreign money for several decades*. Does that count as just ""negligible corruption""?

**PM Narendra Modi Is Reincarnation Of Lord Ram, Says BJP Lawmaker Surendra Singh** 

 ______ 
PM Modi will realise the dream of Ram Rajya in the country, says BJP MLA
Surendra Singh

**Ballia, Uttar Pradesh: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a reincarnation of Lord Ram, who along with
BJP president Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will
realise the dream of Ram Rajya in the country, controversial BJP lawmaker
Surendra Singh has said. Amit Shah, he said, he feels has been sent by the
gods as Lord Ram's brother Lakshman and as Chanakya, the legendary advisor to
the founder of the Maurya empire, Chandragupta Maurya.

For chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, ""And see the coincidence that as
Brahmachari Hanuman, Yogiji has also come.""

""This team of Ram, Lakshman and Hanuman will realise the dream of Ram Rajya in
Bharat and Ram Rajya will be established in national politics,""

Surendra Singh

told reporters in Uttar Pradesh's Ballia last night.

This is not the first time the lawmaker has made controversial remarks.

Drawing on another Ramayana analogy, the lawmaker from Bairia had last month
called

Mamata Banerjee West Bengal's ""Surpanakha""

, the evil sister of demon king ""Ravan"" in Ramayan, and claimed that Bengal
could turn into Jammu and Kashmir from where Hindus had to migrate.

Surendra Singh is the BJP MLA from Bairia

On Sunday he claimed that the

2019 Lok Sabha election would be a ""dharm yudh""

, which would witness a ""battle of cultures"" between the ""Pandavas and
Kauravas"".

""The commander of the Pandavas will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will
be donning the role of Arjun, while the Kauravas will be led by the Congress.
The role of Dhritarashtra will be played by SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav
and RJD chief Lalu Prasad,"" he had said, adding that in the battle of
democracy, PM Modi would emerge victorious.

Last week, Surendra Singh had claimed that

parents are responsible for the increasing incidents of rape

and they should not let their children roam around freely. The remarks had
come in the backdrop of outrage over the brutal gang-rape and murder of an
eight-year-old girl in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir, and the rape of a 17-year-
old girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao district, allegedly by BJP lawmaker Kuldeep
Singh Sengar.

__ Comments

""I am speaking from psychological point of view; no one can rape a mother of
three children. It is not possible, this is a conspiracy against him (Kuldeep
Singh Sengar),"" Surendra Singh had said, according to a video clip put out by
ANI.

**India-Nepal like family, misunderstandings over: Modi** 

 ______ 
KATHMANDU: Indian Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

on Friday said all misunderstandings with Nepal are over and the bilateral
ties are heading to a new high.

Stressing that the recent election and its outcome would be written in golden
words in Nepal's history, the Indian Prime Minister said ties between India
and Nepal are special and ""I am visiting at a special time.""

He made the remarks after the delegation-level talks with his Nepali
counterpart K.P.

Oli

.

""India stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Nepal. India-Nepal ties
are above inter-governmental relations. It is more like a family,"" said Modi.

""I, the Indian government and the Indian people heartily felicitate the Nepali
people for the progress made under federal democratic setup.""

In a bid to reach out to the new communist government in Nepal, Modi held
extensive discussion with his counterpart and senior government officials to
better the bilateral ties that is all set to reset after New Delhi's repeated
attempt to cultivate Oli-led government in Nepal in the recent months.

After the talks, Modi and Oli categorically reached some understandings.

Meeting Oli twice in less than two months, Modi assured him that all genuine
and necessary grievances of Nepal would be addressed in a time-bound manner.

In this respect, Nepal and India have reached half dozen major understandings
during the two-day state visit of Modi that is expected to give momentum in
bilateral ties in future.

However, India remained silent on exchanging banned Indian notes parked in
various financial and banking institutions and held by general people, and on
Nepal's request to add four additional air routes via India.

Modi and Oli held one-one-one and delegation-level talks where both sides
agreed to resolve outstanding issues before September 19 that marks Nepal's
Constitution Day.

India is ready to partner with Nepal for cross border connectivity and agreed
to commence survey to link Kathmandu with the Indian Railways' survey soon.

A team of India experts will begin the survey for the feasibility of the rail
linkages and India is also sending a team of experts to conduct feasibility
survey for inland water navigation from Nepal to India.

""We are connected with Nepal through rail, water, transmission line, petroleum
pipeline,"" Modi told the media.

He also announced a gift of India-made indigenous radiotherapy machine for
Bhaktapur-based cancer hospital.

Both sides also agreed to dispatch a joint technical team to resolve the
recurrent inundation problem along the Nepal-India border.

Both Prime Ministers agreed on expansion on cooperation in agriculture. The
first meeting of agriculture ministers from Nepal and India would be held soon
to chart out a roadmap on agriculture research and development, education and
organic farming.

The two leaders also agreed for an early meeting for the construction of 4,600
mw Pancheshwor Multipurpose Project jointly by India and Nepal.

""We have evaluated the partnership between Nepal and India. Some of the
projects have gained progress and some are in the process of achieving good
progress. We have agreed to review compherensively the trade and transit
treaty,"" said Modi.

""We are connecting through waterways, railways, roadways, transmission line
and oil line, and will cooperate in areas of security and defense.""

The much-awaited 900-megawatt Arun III Hydropower Project was inaugurated
amidst a joint press conference organised at Battisputali-based Hotel
Dwarika's in the Capital.

The Investment Board Nepal (IBN) on Thursday had granted an electricity
generation licence to

SJVN Arun III Power Development Company

to generate power from the Arun III project located in eastern Nepal.

Earlier, in the day Modi was conferred with the guard of honor at a ceremonial
function at Nepal Army Pavilion. The Nepal Army cannon offered a 21-gun salute
in the honor of Indian Prime Minister.

**As Karnataka Votes, Confident Yeddyurappa Announces ""Date"" For Swearing-In** 

 ______ 
**Bengaluru, Karnataka: **As Karnataka began voting today

in an election that many predict will be a close fight, BS Yeddyurappa, the
presumptive chief minister of the BJP, expressed confidence that he would form
the new government on May 17 after an emphatic victory.

Mr Yeddyurappa is the BJP candidate from Shikaripura.

As he spoke to reporters after casting his vote early, he laid out a ""post-
win"" sked.

""I will fly to Delhi on the 15th once the results for Karnataka elections are
announced

and meet Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi. I will invite him and others for the
swearing in ceremony which is going to happen most likely on the 17th,"" he
declared.

He also projected that his party would win between 145 and 150 seats in the

224-member assembly

. Two of the seats are not voting today.'

BS Yeddyurappa says post election he ""will fly to Delhi"" and meet PM Narendra
Modi

""I have toured the entire state three times and am 100% confident that we will
win by a big margin. You all will see for yourselves this evening what the
exit polls say,"" said the former chief minister, adding that the people were
fed up of the Congress government of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.

Mr Yeddyurappa, 75, was chief minister when the BJP took power in Karnataka in
2008, forming its first government in the south.

He was forced to step down as chief minister in 2011 in a blaze of

corruption allegations

. Months after he quit, he was jailed after being charged by the state's anti-
corruption official, Santosh Hegde, in a land scam. He spent 22 days in
prison.

__ Comments

After contesting separately in 2013 - a divided BJP lost power to the Congress
- he returned to the BJP in early 2014, just before the national election.

With the ruling Congress repeatedly raising the

corruption allegations against Yeddyurappa

during the campaign, there has been speculation that the BJP may be inclined
to ditch the 75-year-old politician - who also qualifies for retirement under
the PM's age rule. PM Modi, however, made a reassuring statement at a public
rally backing Mr Yeddyurappa as the party's top man and slamming the Congress
for attacking him.

**President, PM Praise Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Scientists On 20th Anniversary Of Pokhran Tests** 

 ______ 
Pokhran II anniversary: Readying the store before lowering it for the nuclear
weapons testing.

**New Delhi: **

The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were hailed by President Ram Nath Kovind on its
20th anniversary yesterday as a ""bold decision"" that re-positioned India on
the global stage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too said that it reflected the
courage of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's leadership.

India had carried out five underground nuclear tests in Pokhran in the Thar
desert in Rajasthan on May 11 and 13, 1998.

President Kovind said the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests demonstrated the
country's scientific capacity and political will and had a far-reaching impact
on how the world saw India.

He recalled the contribution of his predecessor APJ Abdul Kalam, who had led
the scientific team that made preparations for the tests. President Kovind
also applauded Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was the prime minister at that time,
for his ""courage"" to go ahead with the tests.

""In 1998, the government of the day took the bold decision to go ahead with
the tests and re-positioned India on the global stage. The Pokhran tests of
May 1998 were a demonstration of both scientific capacity and political will,""
the President said.

The nuclear programme of the country was ""built brick by brick"" in a period of
technology denial, President Kovind said in his address after presenting
awards to innovators on the occasion of 20th National Technology Day, marking
the anniversary of the 1998 tests.

He was referring to the sanctions imposed against India after the 1974 nuclear
test that was conducted when Indira Gandhi was the prime minister. The
sanctions, led by the US, had deprived India of critical nuclear and space
technology.

""Those tests had a far-reaching impact on how the world came to see India and
on our foreign policy, our strategic relations and eventually our
international technological collaborations,"" he said.

In a message, Prime Minister Modi also praised the skills of the country's
scientists.

""We also remember with great pride, the skills of our scientists as well as
the courage of our political leadership for the historic tests in May 1998,""
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) tweeted the prime minister as saying.

In the era of technology and innovation, the youth should get acquainted with
more aspects of technology, the prime minister was quoted as saying in another
tweet.

""Our Government is taking numerous steps to create an ecosystem that furthers
outstanding research, innovation and strides in technology ... on National
Technology Day, we salute our stupendous scientists and technology
enthusiasts,"" he said.

After the 1998 tests, the US and its allies had again imposed sanctions
against India but a decade later, the Indo-US civil nuclear cooperation deal
was signed. India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran on May 18, 1974
after which the US and several countries imposed sanctions on the country.

__ Comments

Post Independence, President Kovind said India began to climb the value chain
in technology production in the areas of space and atomic energy and today, it
has expanded to best-in-class capacities in communication technology, IT,
pharmaceutical and biotechnology.

Noting that India was making preparations for the Chandrayaan-2 mission to the
Moon, and several other launches by ISRO, President Kovind said, ""These have
changed perceptions about our country and helped both our people and our
economy. In the past year itself, we have had stand-out achievements such as
the launch of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System - 1L,"" he said.

Rahul maybe a son of nepotism, but if you look on the other side he's actually educated, humble, accepts his mistakes and a team man, and all these qualities are absent in modi who is basically a one man government and is a narcissist, a pathetic liar and seems quite arrogant.

Policies like demonitization are another reason and keeping in mind most of his other policies are well advertised and renamed policies of UPA. I often fail to see the talent one might see in Congress, I fail to spot leaders like tharoor or MMS in BJP. And I doubt their approach, stuff like not appointing lokpal even after having absolute majority, and FRCA and finance bill makes you question if they actually want to work for the country.

I haven't even talked about communalism yet. I have seen people change their stance and hate certain minorities more after 2014 than before. Hating minorities, muslims is common and such people are often modi supporters, and such statements from the BJP members also sufficiate my point. 

One might say that we have seen more worse under Congress (1984 and all), but it's probably because Congress has been in power more. The anti-muslim stand of BJP isn't the same with Congress. It's not their idealogy, yes they do minority appeasement at times, but they are still more secular than bjp is. Imagine a Muslim leader from BJP or RSS in a nearby future, seems quite unlikely.

**You never win with Walmart, warns man who tracked American behemoth** 

 ______ 
Is

Walmart

good for India? Right after US

retail

giant picked up a 77% stake in India‚Äôs largest online retailer

Flipkart

for $16 billion, concerns have been raised over how the American retail
behemoth would impact India. Very few Indians know how Walmart operates in its
home market and how it's perceived there. If you ask the man who has closely
tracked Walmart in the US for more than a decade, Walmart is an unbeatable
force.

""You don‚Äôt ever 'win' in a competition with Walmart. You may survive, but as a
competitor, and as a supplier, you‚Äôll always have to keep changing and
innovating, because Walmart will come after your customers, and Walmart will
come after your profit margins‚Äîbecause Walmart never gives up,"" said American
journalist

Charles Fishman

in an interview to Quartz. In 2006, Fishman wrote a bestseller, 'The Walmart
Effect‚ÄîHow the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works' that described in
staggering detail the operations of the retail giant.

No wonder, online sellers are jittery about Walmart's entry into e-commerce.
They fear that Walmart might bring in its own private labels via Flipkart to
the Indian

consumers

, adding to competitive pressures. ""These products would be brought in at
hyper-competitive prices, which will cannibalise the market and make it
difficult for other sellers to operate. We are studying the situation and will
take appropriate action, including the legal route, if necessary,"" a
spokesperson of the All India Online Vendors' Association (AIOVA), which has
3,500 sellers on large platforms like Flipkart and Amazon, told TOI.

Brick-and-mortar traders too are fearful of Walmart. The Confederation of All
India Traders (CAIT) said the deal was nothing but a clear attempt to control
and dominate the retail trade in India by Walmart through e-commerce in the
long run. ""Digitally powered e-Walmart will certainly vitiate the e-commerce
and retail market. There will be an uneven playing field to the disadvantage
of retail traders. Only the venture capitalist, investors and promoters will
benefit and not the country,"" CAIT said in a statement.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran
Manch said, ""This [Walmart-Flipkart deal] will further eliminate small and
medium businesses, small shops, and opportunity to create more jobs. Most of
these small entrepreneurs are already battling for their existence; entry of
Walmart will further create problems for them.""

Fishman warned that Walmart would be working to increase its profits and
dominance, and not to benefit consumers or the economy at large. ""Walmart will
do what‚Äôs in its interest. Taking care of Indian consumers, workers, and the
Indian economy will be the job of the Indian officials. Walmart follows the
rules, but Walmart will always push to get the best deal‚Ä¶for itself,"" he said.

However, there would certainly be a few positives of the Walmart's entry into
India. Answering the question whether competition between Walmart and Amazon
would good for India, Fishman said, ""It will be both good and bad for India.
If you‚Äôre a consumer, it won‚Äôt be just good, it will be great. There will be a
real effort to woo customers, and to keep them. If you‚Äôre a company in India
that makes products for consumers, this competition will be hazardous. Both
companies will be squeezing supplier companies to offer the best possible deal
to them. So while the business could be big in total volume, the profitability
could be tiny or non-existent. If you are a retailer in India, selling the
same things as Amazon and Walmart, the next year to three years will be very
hazardous. You can‚Äôt ever beat Walmart or Amazon on price. What you can do is
offer things they don‚Äôt.""

FMCG veteran and writer Gurcharan Das points out how Walmart would benefit the
Indian farmer. ""Walmart has worked over the last few years to neutralise the
criticism that might come from retail trade. They have been working in India
in the last 2-5 years selling wholesale to retailers and they are going to use
those retail spots for last-mile delivery. The biggest beneficiary will be the
farmer because the reason Walmart can dare to take on Amazon is because
Walmart has something that Amazon doesn't and that is the ability to take
fresh farm produce through very sophisticated cold chains,"" Das said on ET
Now.

According to an ET report that cited sources, Walmart will likely step up
sourcing from India for its global operations too as the Flipkart acquisition
gives it access to the huge supplier base of the ecommerce company. Walmart
currently sources goods worth over a ‚Äúcouple of billion‚Äù dollars, such as
apparel, generic medicines and handicrafts, from Indian suppliers such as
Welspun and Dr Reddy‚Äôs for its stores in the US, UK, Canada and South America.
Walmart‚Äôs sourcing from India is still small compared with that from China,
which ships some $50 billion worth of goods to the company‚Äôs stores, but the
combination of its Best Price cash and carry business and Flipkart is now
expected to help boost India‚Äôs contribution. The bigger base of suppliers from
Flipkart will offer it more opportunities to source for its retail outlets
abroad, while also allowing the suppliers a wider exposure to overseas
markets.

Most see Walmart-Flipkart deal as a welcome sign for consumers as Walmart is
known for keeping prices down to the minimum. However, Fishman sounds a note
of caution: ""As a consumer, it‚Äôs important to remember that the lowest
possible price isn‚Äôt always the best thing. Quality is as important as price,
so you need to shop with awareness.""

**Shiv Sena accuses BJP of EVM tampering: ‚ÄòPeople do not trust current polling system‚Äô**

By:

Express News Service

| Mumbai |

Updated: May 12, 2018 4:11:47 am

The party said that while the masks of people sitting in power has changed,
the faces remain the same. (Representational Image)

Accusing its ally BJP of tampering with EVMs to win Saturday‚Äôs Karnataka
elections, the Shiv Sena on Friday claimed that people don‚Äôt trust the current
system of polling any more. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the
party said: ‚ÄúWhen former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi won a massive mandate,
the late Sena chief (Bal Thackeray) had questioned her win, saying it was not
the victory of ‚Äòbai‚Äô (Indira), but that of ‚Äòshai‚Äô (ink).‚Äù

Alleging that the Congress had indulged in malpractices in various elections,
it added: ‚ÄúNow, the ink rule is over but the BJP is tampering with EVMs to win
the polls. People don‚Äôt trust the current system of elections now. To say that
Modi can‚Äôt be defeated till EVMs are there, is the defeat of democracy.‚Äù

The party said that while the masks of people sitting in power has changed,
the faces remain the same. ‚ÄúThe BJP hasn‚Äôt defeated the Congress but it has
merged it within itself. Ultimately, the Congress has won,‚Äù it added.

‚Äú(PM Narendra) Modi talks about ‚ÄòCongress-mukt Bharat‚Äô. But although the
Congress is coming to an end, its thoughts are not dying. The BJP is trying to
finish the Congress by imbibing its qualities,‚Äù it said.

The recovery of 10,000 ‚Äúfake‚Äù voter ID cards in Bengaluru shows how the
electoral process in Karnataka has touched a new low, the Sena said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The
fake voter ID cards recovered from one Assembly has raised questions on who is
running the election process in other Assembly seats through such bogus ID
cards‚Ä¶,‚Äù the editorial said.

Alleging that a huge sum of money is being used in the elections, the Sena
said: ‚ÄúFrom where the BJP gets so much money is no more a secret, as everyone
knows the truth.‚Äù ‚ÄúAhead of any election, from gram panchayat to Lok Sabha,
money starts flowing‚Ä¶ and it seems that the notes are being printed by Mudra
Bank in every house,‚Äù said the party, adding that the Congress used to do this
in the past and the BJP has now adopted the same method.

On Congress‚Äô allegation that BJP has copied its election manifesto, the
editorial said: ‚ÄúIn short, the BJP is ready to bear all the cost to win the
polls, which was the Congress policy, and is going ahead step by step. The
Congress might be feeling proud that the BJP is taking forward its ideology
and work.‚Äù

**Nepal would not allow its territory to be used against India: Oli** 

 ______ 
KATHMANDU: Nepal is sensitive to India's interests and would not allow its
territory to be used against India, Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has
assured PM

Narendra Modi

.

Briefing reporters at the end of Prime Minister Modi's two-day visit to Nepal,
foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale today said it was a ""significant statement""
from Prime Minister Oli and India was ""satisfied"" with discussions.

""Oli reiterated that Nepal would be sensitive to India's interests and its
territory would not be used against India,"" Gokhale said.

Nepal shares a border of over 1,850 kms in the east, south and west with five
Indian states - Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
There has been a long tradition of free movement of people across the borders
sharing family ties and culture. Travellers from both sides do not need visas.

During a joint press meet yesterday after a one-on-one meeting with Oli, Modi
had said the open borders between India and Nepal plays an important role in
the strong bilateral ties.

""We will not allow its misuse by anti-social elements,"" Modi said after the
marathon delegation-level talks during which the two sides had extensive
discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationship.

""We have agreed to further strengthen our joint efforts on defense and
security to control cross-border crimes that have been taking place by
misusing our open-borders that are quite important for people on both the
sides,"" he said.

Indo-Nepal border is open, porous and thickly populated. The movement of
people across the border is governed by Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, 1950, which provides for free movement of citizens of both the
countries across the border.

During her meeting with Prime Minister Modi, Nepal President Bidya Devi
Bhandari said high-level visits strengthen people-to-people contact.

Gokhale said Nepali leaders who called on Prime Minister Modi expressed
confidence that his visit to cultural places like Janakpur and Muktinath would
enhance tourism.

He also said that the two sides have agreed to an informal timeline to discuss
all matters by September this year.

The two leaders also discussed implementation of various India assisted
projects in Nepal and decided to bridge the implementation gap in some of the
projects, the foreign secretary said.

""Two visits in two months of two state leaders sets our bilateral relationship
on a very positive and forward looking path,"" Gokhale said.

In response to a question, Gokhale said there was no discussion on the issue
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Nepal is the
current chair of the

SAARC

.

Last month, Oli said that he had spoken to both his Indian and Pakistani
counterparts to resume the stalled SAARC process by sorting out their
differences.

The 19th SAARC Summit was to be held in Islamabad in 2016 but after a major
terror attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September
18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit due
to ""prevailing circumstances"" and stepped up diplomatic pressure on Pakistan.
The last SAARC Summit in 2014 was held in Kathmandu.

248,"This is the same sub that once welcomed the BJP and has now rightfully turned against them because the gigantic disaster the party has turned out to be. People would have still voted for Modi just on the development agenda but that has gone do dogs, now it is all about cow here, mandir there, muslims that, jinnah this Nehru yada yada. It is embarrassing, shameful and repulsive to see what the BJP/RSS has turned this country into.",2018-05-12 20:14:50

250,"Because the number one priority of any government towards its citizens is their security. None of the economic indicators, GDP growth, FDI growth, ease of doing business matters to a citizen, as long as the government cannot commit to their security. And the truth is, as a minority I today increasingly fear of my and my family's safety in the current BJP rule. \(The cow lynching happened in a nearby town of mine in Jharkhand, so I know the threat is real\). 

As a muslim, and a highly educated and integrated one \( I supported BJP in 2014\), I feel that Modi government has only alienated minorities and today none of the muslim community, even the educated ones support BJP \( I know plenty of well educated doctors in my circle\)  and see the society to be highly polarized along the lines of religion. 

I also loathe BJP because the party is authoritative, has zero sense of accountability and is pretty much a one man show. They have been riding high on their Modi wave. They win elections based on Modi and then give power to incompetent and communal leaders like Biplab and Yogi. The whole cabinet with the exception of Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh is almost incompetent, although the entire decision making is just a 2\-man Gujju show and this is going to be even worse in the next election while they go out on an all\-out assault with Modi\-Modi chant. I really want their ego to be broken in this election.

Besides, recent election campaigns has really shown Modi as an insecure leader who has been constantly personally attacking SG and RG, rather than talking about his Government's achievements. The constant whataboutery of the Nehru and 70 years of Congress rule seems never ending and frankly annoying.

Raga v.2 on the other hand has adopted a much sensible approach, and does not look like the ill\-informed politician that we saw in the 2014 elections. He has maintained a level of decency in the recent Karnataka election campaign while the BJP has constantly gone for below the belt attacks.

With Congress, I am risking my vote for another corrupt government which I can live with. With BJP, I risk a communal government that I cannot guarantee mine or my family's safety, which I cannot live with.",2018-05-12 20:41:02

**Govt mulling six-month jail term for those abandoning elderly parents** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government is planning to increase the jail term
for those who abandon or abuse their

elderly parents

, to six months from the existing three months, according to a senior
official.

The

Ministry of Social Justice

and Empowerment, which is reviewing the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and
Senior Citizens Act, 2007, has also proposed widening the definition of
children to include adopted or step children, sons-in-law and daughters-in-
law, grandchildren and minors represented by their legal guardians, the senior
ministry official said.

Only biological children and grandchildren come under the provisions of the
existing Act.

The Ministry has drafted the the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior
Citizen Draft Bill, 2018, which once approved will supersede the existing act.

The draft Act also proposes doing away with an upper limit of Rs 10,000 per
month as maintenance amount, thus making it variable.

""Those who earn well can and should of course shell out higher amount for the
upkeep of their parents. Also the definition of the term maintenance should go
beyond providing food, clothing, housing, health care and include safety and
security of parents,"" the official said.

The Act in its current form makes it a legal obligation for children and heirs
to provide maintenance to senior citizens and parents, by monthly allowance of
Rs 10,000.

Elderly parents can approach a

Maintenance Tribunal

in case their children neglect or refuse to maintain them.

252,"&gt;Again, I think he is talking of personality and intent

How is personality or intent of Modi anywhere near to the man who openly called for killing the lessor men? I see Modi talking about tolerance with minorities, praising Muhammad and wishing Ramadan. Or is that all jumla and modi is a boogeyman conspiring against the muslims like Hitler against the jews? Honestly this hyperbole and ridiculous analogy only makes one resentful of the so called liberals who can't tolerate a strong leader at the helm and resort to such petty and vile comparisons. Something the people who want to break the nation and are are jealous of it's progress would do.",2018-05-12 20:50:12
253,"It's a valid point that educated ministers should be given much more value but on the other hand S &amp; T minister Dr Harshvardhan tweets bull like ""Stephen Hawking said, our Vedas might have a theory superior to Einstein‚Äôs law E=MC2"". Now the guy is a capable ENT specialist and I don't know how much more educated someone can get. Moreover, there is also a possibility that education will lead to smarter scams that may not even be detected. At the end, leader's mindset needs to be changed and they should have empathy and that's what that matters eventually. 

&gt;By the way, bengali BJP faithfuls are the absolute worst of the lot. Then again anybody that is educated and above middle class that still supports BJP holds on to a lot of very disgusting world-views

Oh come on!! Before I am labelled a bhakt and moreover an andh-bhakt, let me tell you I oppose many views of BJP but like the other redditor said, people should vote on the credibility and capability of MPs, not Modi/Rahul or political parties and there are many BJP MPs doing good work in their constituencies (including mine) and as a result their work has been noticed and they get re-elected. Had the same individual been in Congress or any other party, I would have voted for congress or that other party.

2)He has no real commitment, he goes on and off mid election to god knows that

3)He doesn't deserve it, say what you will about Modi but he worked his ass off!From a poor child to the most powerful man in the country, thats a feat!!

4) I hate nepotism, why is he chosen as the leader??There are several politicians better than him.We are a republic not a monarchy, the only good politician from the Gandhi Dynasty was Nehru.The others were complete disasters

5) I agree, he shows signs of improvement, I might vote for him if continues this performance or BJP is fucking up even more but until then if he doesn't show any sign of improvement till 2019 I am 100% going to vote for Modi. I wish AAP was in my state tbh

I used to laugh at his goof ups earlier. That interview with Arnab really made me think how big an idiot he was. But then I saw how Modi ran the country. One man rule. No one was allowed to show dissent.

261,"You are barking up the wrong tree here. Not every article is about the failures of Modi government. To have a productive discussion on ANY topic whatsoever, the scope of that discussion needs to be defined first.

Prakash Singh has done so, in the very initial paragraphs itself. This writeup is NOT about Modi government's failures in providing women security. Yes, they have failed miserably when compared against their own hyperbolic rhetoric everywhere before 2014, but this article is **not about that**.

This article is about the selective outrage those few civil servants have expressed through immese hyperbole in their letter which actually renders even their just and valid expression of disgust and frustration, open to scrutiny and critique. Rephrasing what Mr. Singh said in his article \- Not comparing wounds here and trivialising the Asifa tragedy, but is this really ""independent India's darkest hour""? Really? Darker than Gandhi's assassination? Darker than Emergency?

&gt;but based on my memory of newspapers and articles over the past 10 years or so, the so\-called atrocities committed by Muslims are dwarfed by the volume and the gravity of offences committed by Hindus. 

Not vindicating the current regime. Modi government has been in power for 4 years now, of the 10 years you mentioned. Based on my memory, I do not recall any such protest\(barring the Nirbhaya incident, which didn't carry any communalistic hue\) chastising the ruling regime's failure and deeming India drowning in the deepest and darkest abyss. Hence, the selective outrage.

Singh is simply pointing out the hyprocrisy of the so\-called 'responsible citizens'. Protesting against Asifa's rape is definitely needed. But so does for every girl who is being recklessly raped. Go to any right\-wing portal and check out the names of the Hindu girls being raped by Muslim perpetrators. Yes, those RW are crazy and communalise those incidents maliciously. But that doesn't belie those incidents and those numbers. Who is going to protest for those girls who have been sacrificed in this communalistic hellfire, just from the other side? Or do you want to wait till their number exceed the number of Muslims girls who are being raped and then consider their argument? Here I am particularly referring to this argument of yours:

&gt;the so\-called atrocities committed by Muslims are dwarfed by the volume and the gravity of offences committed by Hindus.

Singh says \- **Protest. Protest as much as you want. But be fair. And be reasonable and sensible about your content and methods. Wild exaggeration and lopsided narratives rarely benefit a just cause; they harm the larger cause instead.**

Also, you began with hypothesising Singh's daughter rape for proving your point, which was totally uncalled for in a civilised and reasoned debate.",2018-05-12 22:10:03

My rant is Unkil if he is serious about all this he could have taken many other steps to ensure that the accessibility and the number of the dust bins are increased and dust bin are not filthy by raising the issue with the Railways and making sure the genuine complaint of lack of dustbin is resolved even for the future citizens. We all paid Swachh cess and this is what we paid for dust bins and accessibility. If that is not there then it doesn't make sense to carry the trash around.

314,"&gt; OP, as far as your point about reporting goes, many activists claim they are a sign of better LE coverage and awareness-not necessarily of higher incidence. So that perspective may help you.

So the number of people reporting rapes have decreased in the US, rather than the number of actual rapes? Mmkay.

&gt; Also these people have a point. It is, at some level, a propaganda that needs to be called out. They are creating a picture that India is somehow worse than it's peers when that is just not a defensible position. 
So reporting rapes = propaganda? Wah bhai wah. What do *you* care what other people in different countries think? The first step is to acknowledge there's a problem.

&gt; Next, let's look at effect. Does this kind of reporting in foreign media improve thing in India? No relation absolutely AFAIK. If you think it has, show proof.
What proof do you have that there's no effect? Modi had kept silent on Asifa's case until recently, and you think he'd have spoke if nobody outside India talked about it? Get real.

&gt; So there you go, neither the intent nor the effect is in favor of any resident living in India- why should I be motivated to play along their narrative and act exactly the way they want? 
Define ""they"", ""act"" and ""the way they want"". Nobody gives a shit about a random citizen of a different country; they instead give a shit about what the overall trend is. Just because YOU aren't a rapist doesn't mean that there are no rapists.

&gt; Am I supposed to be a robot who follows the algorithm See sad news-&gt; Act with sad emojis ? Or am I supposed to be a thinking citizen that analyzes context, subtext, tone, intent and utility ?
Might I point out you're being neither right now?

&gt; Also, you are just wrong about USA not having a significant bulk of rapist defending gentry. Moore lost but wasn't the margin like 49-50 ? Not sure how it supports your point.
Yes, Moore had a significant base of supporters, but the point is that he still lost; also, Moore's case was different insofar that the statute of limitations was exceeded for his crimes, so he couldn't get arrested on those grounds. However, here even when there's plenty of evidence and within the statute of limitations, justice either never prevails or takes an arbitrarily long period of time.

&gt; Get off your high horse OP. You are not more sensitive or more compassionate than the ones who try seeing reality as objectively as they can and call out, in good faith, propaganda for being propaganda.
All I can see from your response is that you're more or less refusing to acknowledge that India has a rape problem, and by calling it ""propaganda"", you're just another nationalist.",2018-05-13 14:35:09

 ______ 
**New Delhi:** Impressed by India‚Äôs rural electrification drive, West Asian countries such as Jordan and Syria and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have evinced interest in state-run Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) bringing electricity to their villages, said a person aware of the development.

This comes in the backdrop of electricity finally reaching all of India‚Äôs
597,464 census villages on 28 April, setting the stage for universal household
electrification. REC, India‚Äôs largest power sector lender, is the nodal agency
that executed the scheme.

‚ÄúGiven our experience and expertise in the field of electrification, we are
prepared to provide a range of services and financing for developing power
sector in other emerging economies,‚Äù said P.V. Ramesh, chairman and managing
director, REC.

The interest from Syria is for the electrification reconstruction work, given
that its power sector has been badly affected due to the civil war.

The West Asian country has witnessed a bloody civil war over the last seven
years. The unrest began as the so-called Arab Spring or pro-democracy protests
that overthrew long-ruling presidents of Tunisia, Egypt and other countries in
the region spread to Syria with the opposition Syrian National Council
fighting to overthrow the country‚Äôs President Bashar Hafez al-Assad.

India has been looking at rebuilding infrastructure in Syria, including a
power plant in the country, _Mint_ reported on 12 August 2016.

‚ÄúWe will extend our support and help in such countries,‚Äù said an REC executive
who didn‚Äôt want to be named.

With some areas in Jordan yet to be electrified, the country has sought REC‚Äôs
help. Also, some sub-Saharan African countries are interested in REC doing the
entire rural electrification package ranging from financing to technology
transfer, detailed project report (DPR) preparation to execution.

In the nine months to December, REC‚Äôs loan book was Rs2.24 trillion, with a
net worth of Rs36,567 crore.

India has been stepping up its engagement with Jordan, seen as part of India‚Äôs
extended neighbourhood to its west. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited
the Gulf Arab states of Jordan, Palestine, the United Arab Emirates and Oman
in February this year.

‚ÄúWe are working in some countries in areas of transmission through Power Grid
Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL). We are willing to provide consultancy to those who
seek assistance through the consulting arms of PGCIL and REC,‚Äù said power
secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla.

State-run PGCIL is already present in 20 countries with its consultancy
business.

Some of its clients are in countries such as Kenya, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh,
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Afghanistan. A case in point being PGCIL
implementing the 220KV transmission link in Afghanistan from Kabul to Pul-e-
Khumri that brings power from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan.

Queries emailed to India‚Äôs ministry of external affairs and Syrian embassy in
New Delhi on Tuesday remained unanswered. Jordan‚Äôs embassy in New Delhi

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had set a target to achieve
universal household electrification by 31 March 2019. With electricity
reaching all 597,464 census villages last month, the government‚Äôs focus is now
on providing electricity connections under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har

**Media ""Grossly Misinterpreted"" Remarks On Mumbai Attack: Nawaz Sharif** 

 ______ 
Nawaz Sharif also criticised the apparent delay in the conclusion of the
Mumbai attack trial

**Lahore: **

Pakistan's ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif Sunday claimed that the media
""grossly misinterpreted"" his remarks. He has been facing ire from all quarters
for his admission on the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.

Mr Sharif, for the first time, publicly acknowledged in an interview that
militant organisations are active in Pakistan and questioned the policy to
allow the ""non-state actors"" to cross the border and ""kill"" people in Mumbai.

The former premier, who has been disqualified to hold public office for life
by the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case, said Pakistan has isolated
itself.

A spokesman for Mr Sharif said: ""At the outset, statement of Nawaz Sharif has
been grossly misinterpreted by the Indian media. Unfortunately a section of
Pakistani electronic and social media has intentionally or unintentionally not
only validated but has lent credence to the malicious propaganda of Indian
media without going through the full facts of the statement"".

""The PML-N would like to set the record straight on the interview of PML-N
supreme leader Nawaz Sharif carried Saturday by Dawn,"" he said in a statement.

The spokesman said the PML-N as the country's premier popular national
political party and its supreme leader (Nawaz Sharif) need no certificate from
anybody on their commitment and capacity to preserve, protect and promote
Pakistan's national security.

""After all, it was Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who, resisting all pressures,
took the most important and most difficult decision on national security in
Pakistan's history by making the country a nuclear power in May 1998,"" he
said.

In an an exclusive interview with Dawn on Friday, Mr Sharif also criticised
the apparent delay in the conclusion of the Mumbai attack trial.

He is under attack from opponents as well as some of the estranged leaders
from his Pakistan Muslims League-Nawaz (PML-N) party for allegedly supporting
the Indian narrative on the Mumbai attack case and harming national interests.

Leading opposition leader and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan said that
Sharif was speaking the language of (Indian Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and
cooperating against enemies of Pakistan to harm the country.

In the interview, Mr Sharif said: ""We have isolated ourselves. Despite giving
sacrifices, our narrative is not being accepted. Afghanistan's narrative is
being accepted, but ours is not. We must look into it"".

Without naming Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed and Maulana Masood Azhar's
militant organisations -- Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Jaish-e-Mohammad -- operating in
the country with impunity, Sharif said: ""Militant organisations are active in
Pakistan.

""Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill
over 150 people in Mumbai? Explain it to me. Why can't we complete the trial"".

__ Comments

Mr Sharif, 68, was disqualified by the Supreme Court for not being ""honest and
righteous"" as he failed to declare in 2013 a salary he got from the company of
his son in the UAE.

Some 166 people were killed in the attack carried out by 10 LeT men. Nine of
the attackers were killed by police while lone survivor Ajmal Kasab was caught
and hanged after handed down death sentence.

**

At least 12 people were killed and over 15 injured in different districts of
West Bengal after lightning struck them amid heavy rain on Sunday, an official
of the state disaster management department said.

Five deaths were reported from Howrah district's Uluberia sub-division, while
there were two deaths each in Paschim Midnapore, North 24 Parganas and Nadia
districts, and one in Murshidabad district, he said.

A person in Howrah district suffered serious injuries and was undergoing

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said her government would provide assistance to
the families of the deceased, as well as those whose houses and crops have
been damaged.

""We do not have control over the nature. We will not be able to bring back
those who have died, but our government will be beside these families and help
them in every possible manner,"" she told a news channel.

Reiterating that the model code of conduct ahead of tomorrow's panchayat
elections was not applicable in case of a disaster in the state, she said the
chief secretary has been asked to carry out a survey of the losses.

""We are yet to ascertain the estimate of the damages. We will do a survey
based on which we will help the families,"" Banerjee said.

**Nine dead in Andhra Pradesh  
**

Nine people were struck dead by lightning and three injured in Srikakulam and
Kadapa districts of Andhra Pradesh, official sources said.

While seven people were killed in Srikakulam district alone, two more were
killed in Kadapa and three injured, they said.

Lightning struck at different places in Srikakulam since Sunday afternoon even
as rain, coupled with gales, lashed the district.

Srikakulam district collector Dhananjay Reddy told PTI that the seven
casualties were reported from different mandals in the district.

Rain was also reported from Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts.

State deputy chief minister (Home) N China Rajappa, while condoling the deaths
of people in lightning strikes, asked the respective district authorities to
take necessary precautionary measures as per the warnings issued by the
Disaster Management Department.

He said lightning strikes, rains and gales were likely in Srikakulam,
Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts in north coastal Andhra, besides in
Anantapuramu, Chittoor, Kadapa in Rayalaseema and SPS Nellore in the south
coast.

**2 dead, over 18 injured in Delhi; 70 flights diverted**

At least two people were killed and more than 18 injured in Delhi after a
squall and dust storm with a wind speed of up to 109 kmph barrelled through
Delhi and neighbouring areas on Sunday.

The storm affected flight, rail and metro operations, uprooting trees, and
leading to incidents of wall collapse.

The sky turned dark grey around 4.30 pm. Gusty winds and rain lashed the
national capital, causing the temperature to drop around 10 notches to 25.2
degrees Celsius.

The strong winds knocked down 189 trees in the city. Four incidents of wall
collapse were reported from Najafgarh, Transit Camp, Nehru Place, Mohan Garden
in Uttam Nagar and Raj Nagar in Palam, said a senior officer of the Delhi Fire
Service.

Traffic in many areas moved at a snail's pace due to the reduced visibility.

The inclement weather interrupted the launch of a 140 kWp rooftop solar plant
at IP Extension attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

**After Nawaz Sharif accepts Pakistan‚Äôs hand in 26/11, BJP wants Congress to apologise** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI. After the former Pakistani Prime Minister

Nawaz Sharif

made a stunning revelation and confessed to his country‚Äôs role in the 26/11
Mumbai terror attacks, the BJP lashed out at

Congress

and questioned if the grand old party will apologize for defaming RSS.

‚ÄúI want to ask our opponents and the Congress whose senior party leaders had
launched a book which claimed that 26/11 attack was an RSS conspiracy. Will
they apologise for it now?‚Äù asked

Sudhanshu Trivedi

, the national spokesperson of the BJP.

In 2010, the then Congress general secretary

Digvijay Singh

had attended the launch of the book 26/11 RSS Ki Saazish? (26/11,An RSS
Conspiracy?) in Mumbai. The book was authored by Aziz Burney.

Last week, while speaking to Dawn, Sharif admitted that terrorist
organisations were thriving in Pakistan and ""non-state actors"" were
responsible for the series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai on November 26,
2008 which claimed over 160 lives.

‚ÄúMilitant organisations are active. Call them non-state actors, should we
allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai?‚Äù said Sharif.

Trivedi said that the startling admission from Pakistan came because

Narendra Modi

government cornered the neighbouring nation on every aspect.

‚ÄúWhatever was there in Sharif‚Äôs mind has come out from his mouth. It shows the
immense diplomatic pressure on Pakistan on issue of terrorism &amp;amp; rigorous
efforts by Narendra Modi government which has almost cornered Pakistan on
every aspect,‚Äù he said.

**PM's Language Unacceptable, Manmohan Singh and Co. Write to President** 

 ______ 
Manmohan Singh and other Congress leaders wrote to the President about PM
Modi's speech.

**New Delhi: **

Prime Minister Narendra Modi must be cautioned against using ""unwarranted,
threatening and intimidating language"", a group of Congress leaders, including
former prime minister Manmohan Singh, has written to the President.

""It is unthinkable that in our democratic polity, the Prime Minister as head
of the government would utter words which are threatening, intimidating in
content and a public warning to the leaders of members of the main opposition
party, the Congress,"" the leaders said in a letter to President Ram Nath
Kovind.

The letter refers to

PM Modi's speech

in Karnataka on May 6, in which he said: ""Congress leaders, please listen
carefully, if you cross you limits, then this is Modi. You will pay.""

__ Comments

This could not be the language of the Prime Minister of a constitutionally
governed democratic country of 1.3 billion people, said the Congress, calling
it unacceptable conduct.

""The threat held out by the Prime Minister to the Congress leadership deserves
to be condemned,"" said the letter signed by several Congress leaders.

	The global trend towards strongman leadership is now well-established. It runs from east to west, and from democracies to autocracies. The key figures are Xi Jinping in China, Donald Trump in the US and Vladimir Putin in Russia ‚Äî with Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines occupying smaller places in this unappealing tableau.

But does India‚Äôs prime minister, Narendra Modi, belong in that list? The answer to that question matters a lot. India, with a population of more than 1.3bn people, may be about to surpass China as the most populous nation in the world. The country is now the third-largest economy in the world, ranked by purchasing power, and its economy is growing at over 7 per cent a year. As James Crabtree writes in The Billionaire Raj, a forthcoming book: ‚ÄúAs democracy falters in the west, so its future in India has never been more critical.‚Äù

India‚Äôs significance is increased by the fact that Mr Modi‚Äôs position on the autocracy-democracy spectrum is ambiguous. The Indian prime minister is a serious economic reformer with a real popular touch. His style is not as thuggish as Mr Putin or Mr Erdogan‚Äôs; nor as wild as Mr Trump or Mr Duterte‚Äôs. And he is subject to far more checks and balances than Mr Xi.

Yet conversations I had in India last week were reminiscent of similar discussions I have had during the past year in the US, China and Turkey. There was the same anxiety among liberals about threats to press freedom and the independence of the courts. And there were familiar concerns that their country‚Äôs leader is deliberately polarising society to fire up his political base.

The comparisons between Mr Modi and Mr Trump are probably most suggestive. Both leaders operate in established democracies and rose to power by campaigning as the champions of a silent majority ‚Äî and against corrupt elites and allegedly pampered minorities. Both men are associated with an increasingly extreme political discourse, on television and social media. Both have used identity politics to rally support, and identified Muslims as the ‚Äúout group‚Äù they can campaign against.

That is playing with fire in India, which is home to about 180m Muslims ‚Äî the largest such minority in any nation in the world. Mr Modi‚Äôs political party, Bharatiya Janata, is often described as ‚ÄúHindu nationalist‚Äù. There was not a single Muslim among the 282 BJP members elected to parliament in the latest Indian election. Each week seems to bring some fresh controversy that stirs up communal tensions.

In one recent appalling case, an eight-year-old Muslim girl was gang-raped and murdered in northern India. Some local BJP leaders took part in marches and rallies in support of the accused killers, who were Hindus. Yet Mr Modi was slow to speak out. The case prompted 49 senior retired civil servants to write an open letter to the prime minister, accusing him of fomenting a ‚Äúfrightening climate of hate, fear and viciousness in India‚Äù, adding that in ‚Äúpost-independence India, this is our darkest hour‚Äù.

This kind of open condemnation of the prime minister requires some courage. Mr Modi‚Äôs critics are hounded on social media and can be put under heavy official pressure. The prime minister himself is careful about what he says publicly. But, as one Delhi journalist puts it: ‚ÄúModi doesn‚Äôt say the worst stuff. He just poses for selfies with those who do.‚Äù

Yet Mr Modi‚Äôs defenders also have a strong case to make. They argue that there will inevitably be some horror stories in a nation of more than a billion people. However, the fears of nationwide violence that accompanied Mr Modi‚Äôs ascent to office in 2014 have not been borne out. Indeed, India saw much worse examples of inter-communal violence in the pre-Modi era, such as the anti-Sikh riots and killings in 1984.

Mr Modi‚Äôs allies argue that his real agenda is about development and economics, not cultural issues. Many of his supporters in the business community were motivated by the prime minister‚Äôs reputation as an effective economic reformer as chief minister of Gujarat.

On the national stage, Mr Modi‚Äôs performance has been mixed. Some actions, such as the 2016 ‚Äúdemonetisation‚Äù ‚Äî the overnight cancellation of 86 per cent of the country‚Äôs cash to combat the black economy ‚Äî probably did more harm than good. But other Modi reforms ‚Äî such as the creation of a nationwide goods and services tax ‚Äî will improve India‚Äôs long-term economic prospects. The GST is over-complicated. Even so, it has helped to break down barriers to trade between India‚Äôs states, and widened the country‚Äôs tax base.

A combination of strong economic growth, Mr Modi‚Äôs personal popularity and relative social peace have helped to burnish the prime minister‚Äôs reputation, turning him from a near pariah, who was once banned from entering the US for allegedly supporting communal violence in Gujarat, into a respected international figure.

A second general election victory in 2019 would cement Mr Modi‚Äôs position as one of the leading political figures in the world. But it would not end the anxieties about his political project. As the cases of Messrs Putin and Erdogan have demonstrated, strongman leaders have a tendency to become steadily more autocratic the longer they stay in office.

As for divorcing her now, it would be a political suicide for BJP and say what you want about Modi, he isn't that foolish. Also, I think she gets top class security and there could be possible attacks on her if he divorces her now since the PM's security would be removed or not taken that seriously.

**Manmohan Singh writes to President on ‚Äòthreatening language‚Äô used by PM Modi, says Congress won‚Äôt be cowed down**

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Monday wrote letter to President Ram
Nath Kovind asking him to caution Narendra Modi from using unwarranted,
threatening and intimidating language. (File)

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Monday wrote a letter to President Ram
Nath Kovind asking him to caution Narendra Modi from using ‚Äòunwarranted,
threatening and intimidating language‚Äô against leaders of the Congress or any
other party as it does not behove the position of the prime minister.

Referring to PM Modi‚Äôs speech in Hubli during campaigning for the Karnataka
elections, where he warned Congress leaders against crossing the boundary or
face a backlash, the letter said that such menancing and intimidating words
might provoke breach of peace.

‚ÄúCongress leaders listen with your ears wide open. If you cross the boundary,
then this is Modi, you will face a backlash (Congress ke neta kan kholkar sun
lijiye, agar simayon ko par karenge, ye Modi hain, lene ke dene par jayenge),‚Äù
the letter quoted PM Modi as saying during a rally in Hubli on May 6. The link
to the video was also mentioned in the letter.

The letter was signed by noted Congress leaders P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma,
Ambika Soni, Mallikarjun Kharge, Motilal Vohra, Kamal Nath, Ashok Gehlot,
Digvijaya Singh, Mukul Wasnik and Karan Singh.

Condemning the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to the Congress leadership, the letter said such
discourse by a PM was unacceptable and the party won‚Äôt be cowed down by such
intimidating remarks. ‚ÄúThe Congress party is the oldest party in India and has
faced many challenges and threats. The party has always exhibited courage and
fearlessness in facing threats and challenges,‚Äù Manmohan Singh said.

The letter also mentioned that the use of ‚Äúmenancing‚Äù language by Modi during
election campaigns amounted to using powers and privileges as the PM to settle
personal and political scores. The Congress letter comes a day before the
results of the Karnataka elections, which has seen an acrimonious war of words
between the two parties.

On May 7, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had sent a legal notice to PM
Modi and BJP President Amit Shah over their continuous barbs levelling
corruption allegations against him. In the notice, the CM asked the two
leaders to tender an unconditional apology or face a defamation suit worth Rs
100 crore.

**India‚Äôs ‚Äòugly‚Äô inflation to pile more misery on bond investors** 

 ______ 
April was the sixth straight month in which retail inflation was higher than
the RBI‚Äôs medium-term target of 4%. Photo: Mint

**Mumbai:** India‚Äôs retail inflation accelerated more than estimated, giving ammunition to hawks in the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs monetary policy committee for tightening policy and potentially adding to the woes of bond investors.

Retail inflation rose 4.6% in April from a year earlier, the statistics
ministry said in a statement in New Delhi on Monday. That‚Äôs faster than the
4.4% Bloomberg consensus.

Monday‚Äôs data‚Äîthe final price print before RBI‚Äôs monetary policy review on 6
June‚Äîadds to concerns that crude oil prices holding at current levels will fan
inflation in Asia‚Äôs third-largest economy. The central bank expects oil prices
averaging around $78 a barrel to stoke inflation by 30 basis points.

Brent crude averaged $71.76 a barrel in April, according to data compiled by
_Bloomberg_. It touched a high of $78 this month.

Paying more for oil, the nation‚Äôs biggest import, will widen India‚Äôs current
account deficit and make the economy more vulnerable to rising US interest
rates. Bonds are poised to decline for the ninth month out of 10 amid concerns
this might push the consumer-price inflation targeting central bank to raise
interest rates sooner than later.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs inflation number is very ugly. It‚Äôs way above expectations,‚Äù Rupa
Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings Ltd in Mumbai,
adding that fuel prices are a worry. ‚ÄúRBI has a rule-based framework so most
likely they will raise rates.‚Äù

The onshore swap markets are pricing in at least 50 basis points of rate hikes
over the next year. Those expectations got a boost after central bank deputy
governor in charge of monetary policy, Viral Acharya, said he would vote for a
withdrawal in monetary accommodation in June, citing sticky core inflation.

Indeed, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel components,
has been hovering over 5%, making the central bank uneasy about price
pressures. That hardening in stance on inflation led to a selloff in bonds in
April. The yield on the 10-year sovereign note rose 10 basis points on Monday
to 7.83 percent, the highest close for benchmark debt since February 2016.

**Selloff deepens**

Foreigners have been pulling out of the bond market given a rise in US yields,
and along with a slowdown in investments in stocks, they have contributed to
weakness in the rupee‚ÄîAsia‚Äôs worst performer this year. That, in turn, is
stoking inflationary expectations, especially imported inflation.

‚ÄúIf India ceases to attract substantial investment in equities and securities,
we could be looking at a shortfall of $19 billion this year,‚Äù said Hugo Erken,
a senior economist at Rabobank International. ‚ÄúAll these developments do not
bode well for inflation.‚Äù

Rabobank expects inflation to pick up to 6.2% later this year.

In a further sign that pipeline pressures were building, wholesale prices also
rose more than expected in April and there‚Äôs little respite in store. India‚Äôs
state-run refiners resumed raising retail gasoline and diesel prices after a
three-week break that coincided with the run-up to elections in a southern
state.

HSBC Holdings Plc said in a note on Monday that rising oil prices would fan
inflationary pressures in India. The bank changed its earlier call on the RBI
and now expects two rate hikes this year, instead of a hold.

‚ÄúFrom a domestic perspective, tightening may not necessarily be warranted, but
the external turn raises pressure,‚Äù economists at the bank said.

**Rs 4,300 Crore Spent By Modi Government On Ads, Publicity, Reveals RTI** 

 ______ 
The Modi government has so far splurged Rs 4,343 cr on advertisements and
publicity, RTI reply revealed.

**Mumbai: **

The central government has so far splurged Rs 4,343.26 crore only for
advertisements and publicity through different media, an RTI reply revealed.

Mumbai-based RTI activist Anil Galgali had sought details from the centre's
Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) on all spend on advertisement and
publicity in all media since the present government assumed office.

As per the replies provided by Financial Advisor, BOC, Tapan Sutradhar, the
government spent Rs 953.54 crore on publicity - Rs 424.85 crore in print
publicity, Rs 448.97 crore on electronic media and Rs 79.72 crore on outdoor
publicity - during June 2014 to March 2015.

In the next fiscal 2015-16, the spending increased substantially for all
media. These included, Rs 510.69 crore on print media, Rs 541.99 crore on
electronic media and Rs 118.43 crore on outdoor publicity, or a total of Rs
1,171.11 crore, reported news agency IANS.

The government earmarked Rs 1,263.15 crore for the 2016-17 period. During the
period, expenditure on print saw a marginal dip with Rs 463.38 crore allocated
for the 2016-17 period, the report revealed, adding that the fund for
electronic medium saw an increase over the previous year to Rs 613.78 crore.
Rs 185.99 crore was set aside for outdoor publicity.

The next year, April 2017-March 2018, there was a sharp drop in spending on
electronic media over the previous year to Rs 475.13 crore and a significant
drop in outdoor publicity expenses to Rs 147.10 crore.

The RTI replies also said that between April-December 2017 (nine-month
period), the government spent Rs 333.23 crore on the print medium alone, with
the total figure of last fiscal (April 2017-March 2018) coming to Rs 955.46
crore.

""A detailed analysis proves that after stringent criticism it attracted,
especially from the opposition and on social media, over squandering of scarce
public resources, the government finally cut down on its publicity expenditure
this year by Rs 307.69 crore,"" Mr Galgali said.

However, he pointed out that the total spending of last financial year is
still significantly higher than the present government's first year in office
when it spent Rs 953.54 crore in just nine months in office.

__ Comments

He added that although it is okay for the government to spend on publicity
wherever genuinely required, in case of excess expenses, reins must be
tightened and the authorities must publicise all such expenditure on its
websites.

**Centre submits draft Cauvery management scheme in Supreme Court** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday placed before the

Supreme Court

a draft of the

Cauvery

management scheme for implementation of the apex court's February 16 judgment
for sharing the river's water.

The bench said it will not go into the correctness of the draft Cauvery scheme
framed by the government and will examine only one issue - whether the scheme
conforms to its judgment of February 16.

""We need to examine whether draft Cauvery scheme submitted by Centre is in
consonance with our judgment,"" said the bench and fixed May 17 as the next
date of hearing.

While submitting the draft scheme, the Centre said it faced a dilemma about
the nomenclature of the body that will be entrusted the task of supervising
the sharing of Cauvery water as per SC's verdict. Centre said it was unsure
whether to call the supervising body a Board, Authority or Committee. Attorney
General KK Venugopal said the Centre would leave nomenclature to the court.

The Supreme Court had on May 3 strongly rapped the Centre for not framing the
Cauvery management scheme to implement its verdict on river water sharing
between four southern states, even as

Tamil Nadu

attacked the union government for its ""partisan"" attitude saying this was the
""end of cooperative federalism.""

The Centre had told the top court that Cabinet approval for the scheme could
not be obtained since Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

and his cabinet colleagues were busy in the

Karnataka

poll campaign.

The top court had on February 16 raised the 270 tmcft share of Cauvery water
for Karnataka by 14.75 tmcft and reduced Tamil Nadu's share, while
compensating it by allowing extraction of 10 tmcft groundwater from the river
basin, saying the issue of drinking water has to be placed on a ""higher
pedestal"".

It had then asked the Centre to formulate a scheme to ensure compliance of its
465-page judgement on the decades-old Cauvery dispute. It had modified the

Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal

(CWDT) award of 2007 and made it clear that it will not be extending time for
this on any ground.

With the apex court's verdict, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Union
Territory of Puducherry would be annually entitled to 404.25 tmcft, 284.75
tmcft, 30 tmcft and 7 tmcft of Cauvery water respectively out of the total of
740 tmcft.

**China counters Donald Trump by mending fences from Japan to India** 

 ______ 
**By Isabel Reynolds and Keith Zhai**

When Chinese Premier

Li Keqiang

smiled and clinked glasses with Japanese Prime Minister

Shinzo Abe

at a reception in Tokyo last week, it served as a reminder of just how rare
these types of warm gestures have been between the Asian neighbours.

The first visit by a Chinese premier to

Japan

in seven years was the latest step in Beijing‚Äôs attempt to shore up fraught
ties with other powers to counter escalating tensions with the U.S. It came
after an equally congenial visit to Indonesia, and Chinese President Xi
Jinping‚Äôs unexpected rapprochements with Indian Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

and North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong Un.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inevitable there will be differences of opinion and friction,‚Äù Li told
executives at a reception marking the 40th anniversary of a friendship treaty
with Japan. ‚ÄúBut I want to maintain the overall direction of friendship, keep
to the spirit of the treaty and build a bright future together,‚Äù NHK reported
him as saying.

Threatened by looming trade sanctions from Washington,

China

is seeking support from other nations to counter U.S. pressure. A Chinese
official told Bloomberg News last month that the government was considering
offering major concessions on trade and investment to the European Union and
countries such as Japan and Mexico.

**‚ÄòBad Situation‚Äô**

‚ÄúChina is trying to make an opportunity out of a bad situation. The Trump
administration‚Äôs moves on trade could negatively affect the Chinese economy at
a time when it faces many internal challenges,‚Äù said Mary Gallagher, director
of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúBut the U.S.
has also antagonized many of its important trading partners and allies, so
China is smart to try to counter the U.S.‚Äù

The shift has required China to lay aside some of its most intense foreign
disputes. Chinese and Indian soldiers faced off in the Doklam region along
their border last year and Beijing and Tokyo still haven‚Äôt resolved their 2012
confrontation over control of East China Sea islands that plunged relations to
their lowest point in decades.

In Xi‚Äôs meeting with Modi in April, the two emphasized that they would avoid
border clashes. Meanwhile, Japan and China signed a memorandum on a maritime
communication mechanism aimed at avoiding unintended clashes at sea.

""By changing the

Japan-China relationship

from one of competition to one of harmony, we can contribute greatly to the
peace and stability of the Asian region, as well as to its prosperity,"" Abe
told parliament Monday.

**Lingering Disputes**

How far China can take the strategy remains to be seen. Many of China‚Äôs
neighbors, including Japan and India, are concerned about Beijing‚Äôs rising
might, especially its willingness to use coercive economic policies to punish
countries that run afoul of its goals. South Korea experienced that last year
after deploying a U.S. missile shield.

Even as Xi and Li mend fences with Japan and India, they‚Äôve seen tensions rise
with Australia over its efforts to limit perceived Chinese political meddling.
And revelations that missiles and other military equipment have been deployed
on China‚Äôs South China Sea outposts have rekindled concerns about its efforts
to establish control over that disputed water body. In a demonstration of its
growing military prowess, China‚Äôs first domestically built aircraft carrier
began sea trials Sunday morning, Xinhua news agency said.

‚ÄúThe smile diplomacy can be successful, but only within certain limits,‚Äù said
June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami political science professor and
author of ‚ÄúMiddle Kingdom and Empire of the Rising Sun‚Äù -- a 2016 book on
China-Japan ties. ‚ÄúThere are restraints on how much Beijing‚Äôs willing to make
concessions, as well as on other sides‚Äô willingness to make reciprocal
gestures.‚Äù

**Japan Deals**

Officials from Beijing are trying to cast themselves as defenders of the
multilateral trade system, countering U.S.-led criticism of restricted access
to Beijing‚Äôs markets.

‚ÄúBoth China and Indonesia believe in globalization and free trade,‚Äù Li told
more than 600 business people at a China-Indonesia business summit earlier in
the week, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. ‚ÄúWe both support the
rules-based multilateral trading regime and stand for equal consultation in
settling trade disputes.‚Äù

Li and Abe oversaw the signing of a raft of agreements, including one allowing
the transfer of two crested ibises from China as a symbol of a friendship
recovering from its worst crisis in decades. China also granted Japanese
financial institutions the status of renminbi-qualified foreign institutional
investor, enabling them to directly invest in Chinese securities and finally
placing Japan on the same footing as Western economies.

Abe accompanied the Chinese premier on a trip to the northern island of
Hokkaido, where they emphasized business ties by touring a Toyota Motor Corp.
plant together. The visit underscored the shared interest in free trade
between the world‚Äôs second- and third-largest economies.

‚ÄúThe current tension between China and the U.S. has required China to have a
greater degree of interdependence with its neighbors,‚Äù said Yang Bojiang,
deputy director of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, a state research institution. ‚ÄúThe strengthening of China‚Äôs
international cooperation is a response to U.S. trade protectionism,
unilateralism, and other trends that do not conform to the times.‚Äù

**Karnataka assembly election results tomorrow: All you need to know** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The counting of votes cast in 222 Assembly constituencies in
Karnataka on May 12 will be taken up on Tuesday morning.

* ""All arrangements have been made for counting of votes in 222 seats from 8 a.m. onwards at 38 centres in 30 districts, including five in Bengaluru where polling was held in 26 of the 28 segments,"" Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar told reporters. 

* The trends are likely to begin to trickle within an hour and all results are expected to be declared by late evening. 

* The Election Commission has deployed 16,662 personnel for counting of votes amid tight security. 

* ""Postal ballots will be counted first before the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are opened,"" Chief Electoral Officer said. 

* In all, 2,622 candidates, including 217 women contested the 222 seats, including 36 reserved for Scheduled Castes and 15 for the Scheduled Tribes. 

* Polling for R R Nagar seat was deferred on account of alleged electoral malpractices, while it was countermanded in Jayanagar seat following the death of the BJP candidate. 

* Several exit polls have predicted a hung Assembly, and said former prime minister H D 

Deve Gowda

's JD(S) would play the role of the kingmaker.

* In case of a clear verdict in favour of the Congress, the grand old party will have broken the jinx of no political party retaining the reins of the state since 1985, when the erstwhile Janata Dal formed the government under Ramakrishna Hegde for a second consecutive term. 

* It is, however, unclear if Siddaramaiah, a backward class leader with a formidable reputation, will be the next chief minister in the event of a Congress victory. Though the Congress had said he would be its face in the elections, it stopped short of declaring him the party's chief ministerial candidate. 

* Siddaramaiah caused a political flutter when he said yesterday that he was ready to make way for a Dalit chief minister if the Congress high command so decided, a statement many felt was aimed at keeping the JD(S) in good humour so as to stitch an alliance in case of a fractured mandate. Siddramaiah is a former JD(S) man and his ties with Deve Gowda's party continue to be strained. 

* Since the Congress had not declared its chief ministerial candidate, Dalit veterans in the party like its leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and state Congress chief G Parameshwara are being seen as possible alternatives. Kharge had recently told PTI he was ready to take up any role assigned to him by the party. 

* A victory in Karnataka would help boost the sagging morale of the Congress, which is on a downhill journey, losing state after state since Narendra Modi came to power at the Centre. Lsing Karnataka will drastically weaken its claim for the leadership of a broader anti-BJP alliance that is being talked about. 

* A victory for the BJP, on the other hand, will reflect the enduring charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his capacity to power his party to victory across the country, clearing demographic and topographical obstacles. 

* It would also further galvanise the BJP cadre before the Assembly elections in party-ruled Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh later this year. 

* The JD(S) has also claimed it would win a majority and that its chief ministerial candidate H D Kumaraswamy will be the ""king"" and not the ""kingmaker"". The party may or may not win the elections, but will play the kingmaker if the electorate give a split verdict, making Deve Gowda an important player in the state politics once again. 

* With the JD(S) having had partnered with both BJP and Congress in the past, it would be tough to predict which way it will go this time in the event of a hung House. 

* One of the possible scenarios could be the coming together of the Congress and the JD(S), as had happened in 2004 when they formed the government under Congress heavyweight Dharm Singh after the state elected a hung House. If that happens, JD(S) may not agree to Siddaramaiah heading a coalition government and likely want a Dalit leader at the helm.

**China launches first India-dedicated investment fund** 

 ______ 
BEIJING: The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a top state-run Chinese
bank has launched China's first India-dedicated publicly offered investment
fund, urging the Chinese to invest heavily stating that the Indian economy is
entering the ""golden age of economic take-off"".

The move, regarded as significant by observers to boost investments in India,
comes just about a fortnight after the first ever informal summit between
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan, where
the two leaders sought to give a new direction to the bilateral ties to tap
their economic potential.

The fund, named as the Industrial and Commercial Bank Credit Suisse India
Market Fund, will ""invest in exchange-traded funds listed on more than 20
exchanges in Europe and the US that are based on the Indian market.""

It is China's first publicly offered fund for investing in India, state-run
Global Times reported.

The fund will invest in the future of the Indian economy and track the
distribution of the industrial structure across the Indian market, the report
quoted a fund manager as saying.

The bank listed sectors for investments specifically, in terms of the major
industries weighted distribution of the index.

The financial industry will account for the highest proportion, followed by
information technology, alternative consumption, energy, essential
consumption, raw materials, medicine, healthcare and other industries, it
said.

The ICBC bank, the largest in the world with over $3.6 trillion in assets, has
given an upbeat picture of India's economic growth path, while launching the
fund.

According to the announcement of the offering, the ICBC Credit Suisse Indian
Market Fund (LOF) will be available for sale at both the on-site and off-site
markets from May 7 to May 25.

""Across the overseas market, India, as the second largest emerging market
economy, is entering the golden age of economic take-off, and has become an
area where international and domestic capitals are competing to pursue,"" a
write-up on the ICBC's website said.

The fund opened the way for domestic investors and ""provided a good tool for
low-threshold investment in India,"" it said.

""Since 2017, the global economy has entered a recovery, and the relative
advantages of emerging markets have gradually expanded, with India showing
remarkable performance,"" it said.

India has become the second largest economy in emerging markets, ranking
seventh in the GDP world, ranking second only to China and the US in
purchasing power parity, and third in the world, it said.

The report said in the context of the ageing population of the world's major
economies, India's low labour costs and abundant labour supply have attracted
much attention, and the capital market has given high expectations for its
economic growth, it said.

""The larger marginal improvement formed by various structural reforms led by
Modi government is expected to unleash India's abundant demographic dividend,""
it said.

Quoting IMF projections stating that India's economy will continue to lead the
global economy for a long time to come, it said ""at the same time, the Indian
rupee value stability, guarantee the security of the investment in India,
India's stock markets risk/reward ratio is high and a low correlation with the
A-shares,"" it said.

A write-up in the Global Times by the fund manager said ""as the most important
emerging market overseas, the Indian stock market's long-term trend must be
positive. For Chinese investors, the current moment offers the best
opportunity to get started in Indian stocks.""

""The certainty of India's growth is very clear. But considering the continuous
acceleration of urbanisation and the expansion of the middle class, India's
future value will be large,"" it said.

If estimated by purchasing power parity, India's GDP is already close to seven
per cent of the world. The situation is similar to China when it started to
rise a decade ago, it said.

""Now, investing in the Indian market means an investor can enjoy double-digit
economic growth,"" it said and added that the Indian stock market underwent a
correction in the first quarter, which means it offers a good opportunity for
opening positions.

Recent research indicates that the Indian market has gradually become one of
the best-performing markets in the world due to ongoing reforms, macroeconomic
improvement and enhanced profitability, it said.

""Take March as an example. Due to trade friction between China and the US,
foreign capital showed mostly net outflows from other Asian stock markets.
However, India's capital inflows reached $2.1 billion, which was in sharp
contrast to other markets in the region,"" it said.

""This shows that foreign investors recognise India's economic strength,"" it
said.

Meanwhile, India is not affected by the trade friction between China and the
US, and it has become a safe haven for funds. Chinese investors should pay
close attention to the Indian stock market and seize new opportunities, it
said.

&gt; Modi promised 20 million jobs a year, but instead more than 7.2 million jobs meant for the 15-24 age group were lost over the last four years. **Job creation in India is at an eight-year low. There is an undercurrent of anger among the middle-class population over having to pay excessive excise taxes, which has led to historically high prices of gasoline and diesel, in spite of lower international crude-oil prices**.

This ridiculous generosity to the corporates is compensated by recapitalization of the banks through public funding. This, in other words, means that the ordinary Indian citizen is bailing out the nationalized banks that are plundered by the corporates**, while millions of poor farmers are struggling hard for the debt relief amid severe agrarian distress.

&gt; ... No one knows what is happening to Modi‚Äôs smart-city project, the ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù project and a number of other much-hyped projects, while many promises on universal health coverage, housing for all, doubling the income of farmers and so forth have fallen short.

A communique from the office of President Ram Nath Kovind said Railway
Minister Piyush Goyal will also handle the Finance Ministry till Arun Jaitley,
who

underwent a kidney surgery

today, recovers.

Ms Irani was given the vital Information and Broadcasting portfolio as an
additional charge last July, when Venkaiah Naidu resigned after emerging as
the NDA's pick for the post of the Vice-President. She will retain charge of
the textiles ministry, which she has been handling since July 2016.

This is the second time Ms Irani is

being moved out of a key ministry

. The 42-year-old, who started as the Human Resource Development Minister in
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, was transferred to the textiles
ministry, seen as a less glamourous assignment, after two years.

The Information and Broadcasting portfolio will now be handled by Rajyavardhan
Rathore, who was the junior minister in the department, with independent
charge

The transfer came after several controversies during her tenure, including
anger across campuses after Dalit student Rohith Vemula killed himself in
Hyderabad after alleging persecution by university officials over his caste.

Ms Irani's 10-month tenure in the Information and Broadcasting Ministry
featured a major controversy in March over a proposed rule that envisaged
severe punishment for journalists on accusation of fake news. The rule --
which suggested withdrawal of accreditation -- was cancelled by PM Modi after
it was widely attacked as an attempt to curb the freedom of the press in an
election year.

__ Comments

President Kovind's office also said SS Ahluwalia, who was the junior minister
for drinking water and telecom, will be the minister of state for the
Department of Electronics and Information Technology. He replaces Alphons
Kannanthanam, who will retain charge of tourism ministry.

The last big reshuffle in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet -- which
involved nine ministries -- took place in September. The biggest change was in
the Defence Ministry, with Nirmala Sitharaman becoming the country's first
Defence Minister. Besides, Piyush Goyal took over Railways from Suresh Prabhu.

**Sugar imported from Pakistan? NCP workers raid Navi Mumbai godown, damage¬†bags** 

 ______ 
The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had already opposed the sale and
distribution of the imported sugar. (Representative image: Reuters)

The issue of sugar imported from Pakistan is hotting up Maharashtra politics,
with NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad from neighbouring Thane district, along with the
party activists, today tearing the sugar bags stored in a godown in Navi
Mumbai, police said. Awhad, who represents Kalwa-Mumbra constituency, said
hundreds of NCP activists ‚Äúraided‚Äù the godown, located in Dahisar Mori area of
the satellite town of Mumbai, and tore the bags containing the imported sugar.
When contacted, a Taloja police station official said a case is being
registered against the NCP activists.

The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had already opposed the sale and
distribution of the imported sugar. MNS leaders from Navi Mumbai yesterday
visited wholesale traders in the Vashi agriculture produce market committee
(APMC), the state‚Äôs largest such entity, and warned them against the
distribution of the sugar.

The import has taken place at a time when the sugar industry is facing a
crisis due to a crash in prices. The prices of sugar in domestic markets have
crashed due to bumper sugarcane crop in the country. ‚ÄúThe Narendra Modi
government‚Äôs move to import sugar from Pakistan is detrimental to the
interests of sugarcane cultivators in state and the country,‚Äù Awhad told
reporters.

He said the people should refuse to buy the Pakistani sugar. ‚ÄúI am afraid that
RDX (an explosive) could be smuggled into India through these consignments of
sugar, which is a national threat,‚Äù the MLA said. When contacted, Deputy
Controller, Rationing, Naresh Wanzari said the godown in question is not owned
by the state government. According to reports, around 65 lakh tonnes of sugar
imported from Pakistan has arrived in the Vashi APMC.

**Karnataka election results: BJP well ahead of Congress, JDS gaining too** 

 ______ 
Karnataka election results would also serve up an indication of the national
mood going into 2019 Lok Sabha elections, where a direct face-off between
BJP‚Äôs PM Narendra Modi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi is a given. Photo:
PTI

**Bengaluru:** Two hours into counting of votes in the Karnataka elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was racing ahead leading in 109 seats while the Congress was leading in 65seats, as of Regional party Janata Dal Secular is also gaining in comparison to 2013, ahead in 41 seats.

Votes are being counted for the 222 assembly seats for which elections were
held on Saturday May 12. The Karnataka assembly has 224 seats, but elections
were deferred in two. A party needs to win 112 seats today to get a majority.

Track Karnataka election results live updates here.

Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah of the Congress was leading in Badami by
over 4,000 votes and but was trailing in the other constituency he contested,
Chamundeshwari, by over 6,000 votes.

The 2018 Karnataka elections saw a fierce contest between the two major
political parties Congress and BJP in what is seen as a bellwether for the
2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP‚Äôs charge while Karnataka chief
minister Siddaramaiah and Congress party president Rahul Gandhi led the
Congress. The JD(S) was led by the father-son duo of H.D.Deve Gowda and
H.D.Kumaraswamy.

For the BJP, Karnataka is its gateway to south India into states like Tamil
Nadu and Kerala, where it has little or no presence. The Congress, after a
series of losses in state elections is trying to retain one of its last big
states as it tries to revive its fortunes before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,
where it will challenge the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

The JD(S) is trying to bag as many seats as it can; it can play powerful
kingmaker if Karnataka delivers a fractured verdict today.

The JD(S) is the only party that has allied with both the BJP and Congress, in
different coalitions, playing a key role in rescuing national parties when the
latter falls short of a majority.

He was extremely arrogant and deluded in the build up to the elections i.e over the past 5-6 months. All neutral people were fed up of his behavior and wanted to bring a change in the government.

- PM Modi still has tremendous mass appeal by the way he was clearly able to shift the paradigm towards the concluding stages of the campaign.

- The electorate has clearly rejected the sham welfare schemes of Siddaramiah which are now proved to be just a repugnant attempt at appeasement of a particular section.

- Even the swing of Bangalore towards the BJP shows the people are unhappy with the level or lack thereof of infrastructure and flourishing crime.

- The Vokkaligas dump the Congress and consolidate behind the JDS who reinforce the hold on the South East karnataka.

**BSF jawan killed as Pakistan violates ceasefire along LoC in Jammu** 

 ______ 
A

Border Security Force

jawan was killed in ceasefire violation by Pakistani army along the
International Border (IB) in Samba district of

Jammu and Kashmir

, a senior

BSF

official said today.

The firing from across the border comes barely four days ahead of the visit of
Prime Minister

Narendra Modi

to the state, and also ended months of lull in the border skirmishes along the
IB which saw heavy Pakistani firing and shelling earlier this year.

Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked and indiscriminate firing on forward
posts in the Manguchak area around 11.30 pm last night and was effectively
retaliated by the jawans guarding the IB, the officer said seeking anonymity.

He said heavy firing between the two sides continued for an hour during which
Constable Devender Singh was hit by a stray bullet through the loophole of his
picket.

He was immediately evacuated to a hospital but could not survive, the officer
added.

He said intermittent firing between the two sides was still continuing when
last reports were received.

The incident came barely 24 hours after BSF noticed suspicious movement of a
group of five persons, believed to be terrorists and attempting to sneak into
this side, along the IB in Hiranagar sector of nearby Kathua district,
prompting a massive search operation and sounding of a high alert in Jammu.

Army also pressed helicopters into service during the search operation which
entered the second day today, the official said.

Singh's death took the number of persons killed in over 700 incidents of
Pakistani shelling along the IB and

Line of Control

(LoC) in the state -- highest this year -- to 33. The deceased included 17
security personnel.

Prime Minister is scheduled to arrive in Jammu and Kashmir on May 19.

There has been a lull in firing along the IB over the past three months after
intense border skirmishes in January and February, which led to many
casualties and forced civilians to flee their homes.

However, the frequent ceasefire violation by Paksitan was going on along the
LoC.

461,"The BJP has an amazing campaign machine. They mobilize resources like nothing else and are able to use extremely smart resources and tech to guide them towards victory. For whatever reason, the Congress is not even close to achieving that.

But this is just a game of numbers, ultimately.

* Vote shares: You just have to look at their vote shares to see that while the two parties are evenly matched on vote share, the BJP has 2x the number of seats (It's a bigger mismatch than the US election popular vote, for reference). Clearly the BJP target constituencies with laser precision and do the needful to win.

* Anti-incumbency: Obviously rife - Siddu's govt. has hardly covered itself in glory in the last 5 years. A few % votes here and there is enough to swing the election one way or another.

* 2013 elections: Congress had around the same vote share (37%) but the BJP had 19%. Yeddy's party had around 10% of the votes, and was dividing the BJP votebank into two. Since then they've kissed and made up, and the BJP has recovered its base + a little more due to anti-incumbency.

* 2008 elections: Remember that this isn't the first BJP govt. in Karnataka - they won 121 seats in 2008 at a time when INC's stock was pretty high nationally and they still had a lower vote share than the INC (33% to 34%).

* 2014 general elections: Compared to the 2014 wave, BJP has ceded more vote share than the Congress, with regional parties grabbing that bit.

That's about it, really. This election doesn't really seem like a plebiscite on national politics or a Modi wave as much as it is a reinforcement of KA's existing votebanks.

why does Indians vote for Modi, because he has a track record of killing Muslims, why else.... please dont even try to come up with other reasons, it is as simple as that...

BJPA excels in ground level campaigning as it has ideological branches in almost every majority Hindu dominated area.

Even though there is not as much difference in vote share, No. of seats margin is huge. Same problem was raised in U.S. election. All over the globe, eldctoral college system is being questioned, as it promotes seat manupulation, and gives bigger parties with huge analysis tools an unfair advantage.

Modi constantly engages in attempt the alter the history, his politicians are increasingly making hate and anti Minority more mainstream, Hindi is promoted more and more. People are being fed BJP's version of Nationalism more and more and those who oppose it are being labeled anti Nationals, anti Army. Online trolls and Politicians alike are pushing Hindutva as the Real Hinduism. Anybody who talks against Hindutva is labeled as anti Hindu. Anti Intelectualism is a fashion and Liberals and their views are now labeled as Elitist Luteyan, pro British, anti poor while Communists and groundlevel Leftists are labeled as Maoists, Urban Naxalites and anti Indians.

486,"Congress party is faulty. They should have used siddaramaiah in Punjab and Captain in Karnataka. Got leaders from Kerala and rajasthan to campaign in other states. Then you will be able to evaluate who among them has any appeal in other states. 

But Congress doesn't want state leaders to grow and become popular in other states. Because then they will be a threat to Gandhi monopoly. In Congress, power must flow from the first family and hence you see the likes of PC, Jairam Ramesh, ST, Alva etc who can't win a region (forget state) but have significant power in Congress. 

BJP got yogi, Raman Singh, Shivraj Singh, Fadnavis etc to campaign other than various union minsters. This is despite the fact that siddaramaiah was running a divisive campaign of language politics and regional pride - using non-kanadiga leaders could have backfired spectacularly. Whenever Modi moves out, one of the above can take a lead depending on popularity. ",2018-05-15 13:54:02

Of the amount, a meagre Rs 29,343 crore has been recovered, according to data available with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
