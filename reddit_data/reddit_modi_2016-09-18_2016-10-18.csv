NEW DELHI: Reliance Group Chairman AnilAmbanion Saturday was just one of many prominent public figures who wished Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his birthday.



But Ambani's message was special. For in it, he revealed something his father - legendary industrialistDhirubhai Ambani- once said about the PM.



""Lambi race no ghodo chhe. Leader chche,"" Ambani senior had said according to his younger son. The translation: ""He's a thoroughbred for the long run. A true leader!""



Anil Ambani says his father had invited Modi home in the early 1990s, several years before he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. Once Modi had left after having a ""long, intense conversation"" with the Reliance founder, the latter had remarked that Modi would one day become the Prime Minister, Anil wrote in his message.



""As ever, Papa was simple, direct - and prophetic!"" he said.



Calling PM Modi's election to the highest office in the Union government ""a defining moment"" in India's history, Anil Ambani wrote: ""Papa would have been smiling in heaven that his prophecy as usual had come true.""



Dhirubhai Ambani's estimation of PM Modi's personality is perhaps best summed up by another, rather more poetic, quote that Anil attributed to him. ""In the words of my father, Narendrabhai ""dreams with his eyes open"" and with Arjuna like clarity and purpose,"" he said.

6,"#Arvind Kejriwal's Tongue Was Trimmed As He Spoke Against PM: Manohar Parrikar

___

Panaji: Taking a jibe at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said Kejriwal's tongue had to be trimmed as it had grown long as he spoke against the Prime Minister and him. However, the minister also sympathised with the AAP leader for being on ""sick leave"".



 
""In Delhi, he speaks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and here (in Goa) he speaks against me. Due to this his tongue has grown big, and now it had to be trimmed,"" Mr Parrikar told a core group of workers in Goa ahead of the State Legislative Assembly polls.



 
But, the Defence Minister was quick to add, ""I sympathise with him (Kejriwal) as he is on sick leave.""

Mr Parrikar took a dig at the AAP leaders for ""abandoning"" Delhi when the state was reeling under chikungunya and dengue crises.



 
""If your Mohalla clinics were so much effective then how come 40 people died due to chikungunya. The lies of AAP are getting exposed in Delhi after the incident,"" Mr Parrikar said.



 
He said the AAP leaders are currently on a world tour after cheating the people of Delhi, with its deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in Finland.



 
""From where does AAP get the money? They spent Rs 26.82 crore merely on advertisement budget,"" Mr Parrikar added.



 
Referring to sacked Delhi Minister Sandeep Kumar, who was arrested on charges of rape on a complaint of a woman who figured in an objectionable video with him, Parrikar said, ""AAP leaders are found exploiting a woman merely to give a ration card.""



 
The woman had alleged that she was raped by Mr Kumar when she had gone to his office in Outer Delhi's Sultanpuri seeking help to obtain a ration card.



 
Mr Parrikar also quoted a WhatsApp joke making rounds in Delhi circles, which says that the Tihar superintendent has written to Delhi Governor asking to make him the CM as he has majority of AAP MLAs with him (in jail).



 
Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, while addressing the workers, said the concept of mohalla clinics introduced by AAP in Goa is ""unwarranted"" as BJP-led government has already made treatment in the private hospitals and government-run hospitals free of cost by introducing health insurance scheme.Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelated'Lt Governor Doesn't Want To Work On Weekend': AAP Hits Back Amid Health Crisis In DelhiMore StoriesRJD Lawmaker's Son Allegedly Stabs Man For Overtaking His Car, ArrestedArvind Kejriwal's Tongue Was Trimmed As He Spoke Against PM: Manohar Parrikar'Lt Governor Doesn't Want To Work On Weekend': AAP Hits Back Amid Health Crisis In Delhi

7,"#Why AAP Is Wrongly Attacked Over Its Leaders' Absence

___

  
 
  
  There are two issues which have been debated by the media, specially TV. One is that there is an outbreak of water-borne diseases in Delhi and second is that during this time the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi is away in Finland and he did not cut his visit short even when the people of Delhi are suffering. Manish Sisodia has gone to study the education system of Finland which is supposed to be one of the best in the world. There is one more issue. According to media reports, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Mr Najeeb Jung has summoned Manish to Delhi immediately.



 
There is no denying the fact that water-borne diseases have acquired an epidemic proportion: Chikungunya and Dengue have created havoc in the national capital and people are scared. It so happened that the day the newspapers reported the first death by chikungunya, five minsters including the Chief Minister were away from Delhi. It is another matter that during the same time, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi was also holidaying in the USA and the Heath Secretary was on leave for 15 days. But as always happens, the AAP government was severely criticised though the Health Minister cut short his visit to Goa and landed in Delhi on the same day and took control of the administration.



 
At the outset, this looks like a routine exercise in the affairs of a government but it needs deeper introspection. In a democracy, criticism is welcome and unavoidable. It keeps governments on their toes and make them accountable and responsible. I have no quarrel with that but I want to raise a bigger issue. What should be the issue? The governance or the incidental absence of the ministers? What should be debated - the media's right to criticise or the embedded journalism pursued by a few media houses at the behest of the Modi Government? What is at stake - the freedom of expression or perversion of the media freedom?

The absence of ministers is incidental. Arvind was scheduled to go for a long pending surgery for his cough which he could not have avoided. But may I ask since when has India started mocking the illness of a leader or a person? I was reminded of Sonia Gandhi's illness a few years back and when a section of the political spectrum made fun of her illness, it was universally condemned and the media backed off. Similarly, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was suffering from a knee problem and when Time magazine wrote about it in a derogatory manner, the reporter was asked to apologise and he did. India has never indulged in cheap thrills about any leader's infirmities but Arvind was mocked. Sonia's party Congress declared him a Bhagoda, Modi supporters used all kinds of names in the social media. I ask, is it justified, is it morally correct?



 
Manish had not gone on a junket to Finland. It is a perfectly legitimate official tour but it has been made out as if he is the most insensitive human being, having fun when people were dying in Delhi! It is nonsense. The campaign run by a few TV channels has exposed itself thoroughly. It had shown an ulterior motive. The fact is that health and education have been two flagship programmes of the AAP government. AAP has promised to structurally and functionally reform these two sectors which have been the most neglected in our country since independence.



 
AAP had made a promise that it would bring government schools at par with the private schools and in the last 18 months, it has been true to its promise. Major reform initiatives have been taken. More than 8,000 classrooms have been built, the institution of the Principal has been made the pivot of the educational reform, the curriculum has been changed to meet the demands of the most modern educational needs of a student, teachers have been sent to prestigious institutions like Harvard and Oxford universities to hone their skills, and all this has shown results.



 
Similarly, the AAP government has made serious efforts to revolutionise the health sector. A three-tier system has been devised to make health services accessible and affordable to the common man. Mohalla clinics have created waves across the globe. The Washington Post and Chicago Tribune have written that the USA should learn from the Delhi government about this part of health services. Medicines have been made available free in Delhi government hospitals.



 
Our adversaries have of course not liked these two initiatives, specially the Modi government. The spread of chikungunya and dengue came as a God-sent opportunity for such people to discredit AAP's record of governance and malign its path-breaking efforts in the field of education and health. Unfortunately, the media also became a party to their celebration. There was no debate on what preparations had been made by the AAP government despite the very clear Delhi High Court orders that Lieutenant Governor would be the fountain head of the Delhi administration.



 
The first meeting to meet the crisis of water-borne diseases was held in the month of February by AAP government. The number of fever clinics was increased by more than 650%, from 55 to 355 in comparison to last year. 1,000 beds were added in advance in Delhi government hospitals, capping of prices on testing in private hospitals was done long before the breakout of the disease. Water-borne disease grants were released by the AAP government to municipal bodies without any requests from them for the same on the 6th of June. According to the 1957 Delhi Act, sanitation is the prime responsibility of the municipal bodies. They should have taken the initiative but they did not. According to media reports, the Swachchata Abhiyan fund which was sent by the union government for cleanliness was not utilised at all. The NDMC did not use a single penny and South MCD spent only 0.25% of the allocated budget. Since preventive measures were not taken, curative measures became difficult and carpet coverage created panic which made hospitals jobs more difficult.



 
Then the Health Secretary was removed despite the repeated requests by the AAP Government to not do so. The new Health Secretary's request for 15 days' leave was granted by the same Lieutenant Governor at the same time. Was it by design? And now it is reported that the Lieutenant Governor has summoned the deputy Chief Minister to immediately report to Delhi. This was done at a time when Health Minister Satyendra Jain is in full command of the situation and there is no need to panic. May I ask under which rule and article of the constitution can he do that? Does the Lieutenant Governor think that in Delhi, the relationship between the Lieutenant Governor and an elected government is of the nature of employer and employee? If it is so, then it should immediately be spelt out. Because there can never be a greater insult to the will of the people than an unelected Lieutenant Governor assuming that he is the employer and can hire and fire an elected government at his will.



 
With my experience of being a journalist, I find that the role of a few channels has also not been up to universally acceptable parameters of ethics of journalism. There has been an attempt to turn a non-story into a story. Manish's presence in Finland was termed a fun trip which it was not. One can send a reporter and verify things with the Finland government. But such an attempt was not made. Judgements were passed and a diabolical attempt was made to tarnish the image of an honest and hard-working minster. Should the media not introspect? Should it not be questioned why the same channels are not questioning arrest of the Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani when Modi is visiting Gujarat? Everybody knows that cities like Ahmedabad and Surat have been turned into police camps as if martial law has been imposed. Dalit and Patidar leaders' house are raided and threatened by the police as happens normally in an emergency.



 
AAP is open for any kind of scrutiny by media and otherwise too, but if the media becomes complicit in a political conspiracy, then questions should be asked about the efficacy of democracy. And also, is the media really free in Modi Times? The debate should continue!

8,"#AAP Government To Challenge Ad Panel's Order In Court

___

New Delhi: The Delhi government will challenge the order of a central government appointed panel that indicted the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation for ""splurging"" exchequer's money on advertisements in the court, as it questioned the committee's neutrality.



 
The AAP alleged that it was a ""ploy to defame"" the Kejriwal government by the ""beneficiaries"" of Narendra Modi government and the BJP.  
  
  



Show Full Article

""The Delhi government will challenge the very composition of the committee and its biased findings since the centre is an interested party. It (the Centre) has done a number of flip-flops in the case,"" said a Delhi government spokesperson.



 
AAP leader Ashutosh said the committee's remarks were an apt example of Congress and BJP coming together as the panel gave its report on the complaint filed by Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Maken against the Delhi government.



 
The three-member committee, headed by former Chief Election Commissioner BB Tandon, had been constituted by the Information and Broadcasting ministry on the directions of the Supreme Court to address issues related to Content Regulation in Government Advertising. The panel also comprised adman Piyush Pandey and journalist Rajat Sharma.



 
""This is nothing but a ploy to target and defame the Delhi government. The committee required people of impeccable neutrality and those who could do their job without showing any bias or partiality. But two members of the panel are either linked to the BJP or are beneficiaries of Modi. So, how can one expect a fair report,"" Ashutosh alleged even as he refrained from attacking Mr Tandon.



 
The AAP leader alleged that of the two panel members one is linked to BJP since his college days while the other chalked out a campaign for Modi during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.



 
He also said the Delhi government will explain its stand before the Supreme Court.



 
In its report, the committee came down heavily on the AAP government, saying it had splurged exchequer's money on advertisements projecting Mr Kejriwal and his party in violation of the Supreme Court guidelines and asked the ruling party to reimburse.

Anyone with some common sense can see he is guilty. He got aways by destroying evidence and targetting people who saved muslims and rewarding murderers by making them ministers. Since bhakts lack commonsense, they will view him not guilty.

&gt; * The difference between Modi and Trump is that with Trump, there is no ambiguity.

&gt; * Indeed, Trump's tactics are almost the opposite of Modi's, because he's putting a spotlight on fear backed up by vague policy proposals.

&gt; * Trump is generally considered to be behind Clinton, but if he can exceed expectations the way Modi did in India's election, then he will win.

&gt; * It has identified 80 inter-state check points pan-India to be augmented for smooth flow of goods,"" an official said.The official said an estimated Rs 50 crore is likely to be spent on each such check post.Citing an example, the official said, ""Cargo vehicles including trucks and lorries at present prefer reaching Bangalore from Delhi via Rajasthan despite it being a longer route as Delhi-Bangalore, despite being shorter, has many check posts which delay cargo.

&gt; * ""Long queues of lorries and trucks can be seen at various check posts by forest department and various other government departments including border posts.These unproductive transit hours, as well as regulatory hurdles, delay overall manufacturing and trade.However, a unified tax and regulatory environment under the GST would help improve the delivery process and cut down on transport hassles.

&gt;* According to officials who spoke to The Sunday Express on condition of anonymity, the deciding factor in buying the Rafales, even in such small numbers, was its ability to be used as an airborne strategic delivery system.

&gt;* Meanwhile, sources have confirmed that India has extended an invite to the French defence minister, Jean Yves Le Drian, to visit Delhi next week.

&gt;* Although a formal confirmation from Paris was not received till Friday, the two sides are expected to announce the signing of an IGA for 36 Rafales next week.

  NEW DELHI: The Indian Army's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh, today stated that the four terrorists who attacked an administrative base in Uri early morning, belonged to the Pakistan based terrorist outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and were carrying ""war-like stores"", which had Pakistani markings on them.  

 

  The DGMO also said that he has spoken to his Pakistani counterpart to express concern over the incident.  

 

  ""They were foreign terrorists. Initial reports indicate that the slain terrorists belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed tanzeem. Since the terrorists had some items with Pakistani markings, I have spoken to the Pakistan DGMO and conveyed our serious concerns on the same,""said Ranbir Singh, adding that four AK-47 assault rifles, four Under-Barrel Grenade Launchers, a large number of grenades and war-like stores were recovered from them.  

 

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said there are ""definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped"".  

 

  He expressed his deep disappointment with ""Pakistan's continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups"". Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolated as such, he added.  

 

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi today tweeted, ""I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished.""  

 

  This is not the first time that the JeM has attacked a defence forces installation. In January this year, JeM terrorists from Pakistan had attacked the Pathankot Air Force Station, where India's strategic assets are located.  

 

  Ranbir Singh said that out of the 17 fatal army casualties, 13 to 14 of them have been due to the tents and temporary shelters catching fire at the Uri base.  

 

  ""The terrorists had opened fire with incendiary ammunition and small arms. This led to the tents and temporary shelters at the camp catching fire,"" said the officer.  

 

  The tents located in the complex were to house additional troops inducted due to routine turnover of units.  

 

  The DGMO said that the Army chief, General Dalbir Singh Suhag, has visited the site of the operation to take an on-ground assessment. Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar landed in Srinagar in the evening and will be briefed about the incident by the Army chief.  

 

  Ranbir Singh narrated that a group of heavily armed terrorists opened fire on an administrative base of one of the units of Indian Army at Uri in Kashmir at about 5.30 am today. The firefight between the terrorists and the Army Personnel continued till about 08.30 am, during which four terrorists were killed.  

 

  ""The operation for clearance of the area is still in progress and a very deliberate search is being carried out of the entire area around the Military Complex in Uri. As such, complete details of the operation are not yet available. However the operation is being carried out by the Indian Army in a very professional manner. The Army personnel have displayed exceptionally high standards of courage and gallantry while neutralizing the terrorists,"" said the DGMO.  

 

  The army said that all the intelligence agencies are working with the security forces and necessary action is being taken accordingly.

NEW DELHI: Defence MinisterManohar Parrikaron Sunday paid tribute to the 17 jawans martyred in theUri terror attack+inJammu and Kashmir, saying their sacrifice wouldn't go in vain.



Parrikar made these comments upon his return to Delhi from Srinagar, where he reviewed the security situation, and visited some of the jawans injured in the attack. He asked that they be given the best possible treatment. Three to five of the injured soldiers have been flown to the Army Research and Referral hospital in New Delhi, defence sources said.



""The supreme sacrifice of 17 brave Soldiers will not go in vain. My salute to them,"" Parrikar said. He added that he'd instructed the Army chief and commanders ""to take firm action+.""



Parrikar had cancelled a trip to Goa - where he was scheduled to chair meeting of the BJP's women's and youth wings - to rush to Srinagar to take stock of the situation in Uri. After Parrikar was briefed by the Northern Army Commander Lt Gen DS Hooda and Chinar Corps Commander Lt Gen Satish Dua, the Army lauched an operation against the Uri terrorists - and killed all of them.



In addition to planning a response to the attack, Parrikar and the commanders also discussed how the terrorists may have infiltrated Indian territory.



Finger pointed at Pakistan



Earlier today,Prime Minister+Narendra Modi, President Pranab Mukherjee, Cabinet ministers and Opposition leaders spoke in one voice to strongly condemn the Uri terror attack, which is widely seen as yet another example of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.



In a statement based on initial reports, Ranbir Singh - the Director General of Military Operations - saidobjects bearing Pakistani markings+had been recovered from the terrorists. He added that the reports suggested that all terrorists were foreign nationals, and were from the terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed.



Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had singled out Pakistan for strong criticism even before these revelations were made. After chairing a security meeting at his residence, Singh said there were ""definite and conclusive indications"" that the perpetrators of the Uri terror attack were ""highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped.""



He didn't mince words while talking about the source of the attacks. ""I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan's continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,"" he said. ""Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolated as such,"" he added.

*A welcome addition to the debate on India's options in dealing with Pakistan and cross-border terror.*

___





Ahead of the 2014 general elections, 



[IMAGE](http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/modi_042215023911.jpg)



Narendra Modi successfully projected the image of a tough leader who would transform the terms on which India dealt with terrorism emanating from Pakistan. During his initial months in office, Prime Minister Modi seemed to make good on this promise. Since then, however, the Indian government has struggled to evolve a coherent and consistent policy towards Pakistan. Faced with terrorist attacks, New Delhi has resorted to the old playbook of calling off talks and urging Pakistan to bring the perpetrators to justice.



[IMAGE](http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories//2016September/book1_091516023820.jpg)



 To be sure, the government hasn't had to deal with a major attack on the scale of 26/11. In consequence, the question of how the Modi government will respond to a major terror attack remains open. In particular, the old debates on whether, and how, India can use force to coerce Pakistan remain unsettled.George Perkovich and Toby Dalton's book is an excellent contribution to these debates. India, they argue, will inevitably have to do more than strengthen its homeland security. Coercion or the use of force to move Pakistan's behaviour in the desired direction remains an indispensable option. Following Tom Schelling, they consider coercion both as deterrence-the threat of force to prevent an adversary from doing something-and compellence, or the threat of force to get an adversary to do some thing. Compellence is clearly more difficult than deterrence. This is especially tough when the adversary is not a unitary actor but a combination of state and its client terrorist groups. Put simply, the question is whether India can use the threat of force to convince Pakistan to clamp down on the terrorist outfits that it has patronised for so long.

Put simply, the question is whether India can use the threat of force to convince Pakistan to clamp down on the terrorist outfits that it has patronised for so long.Indian decision-makers confronted this question most starkly during the 2001-02 and 2008 crises. In the wake of the attack on Indian Parliament in December 2001, New Delhi massed the armed forces along the borders with Pakistan and threatened to inflict severe punishment. Following the attacks in Mumbai in November 2008, the Indian government took a different tack: it sought to direct international pressure on Pakistan to force it to speedily bring the organisers of the attack to justice.

Perkovich and Dalton provide a lucid and clear-eyed appraisal of the choices open to India and their likely consequences. Such sustained analysis is rare in Indian strategic discussions, where assertions often masquerade as arguments and the ex cathedra pronouncement is a favoured mode of discourse. Even those who disagree with them will learn much from their patient and systematic unpacking of the options available to India.

The authors appear to endorse George Tanham's old and controversial conclusion that India has no strategic culture. In fact, there is a growing body of scholarship drawing on archival sources that completely demolished such claims and shows that India was quite a normal strategic actor.

The first is a 'pro-active' army-centric strategy that threatens to strike inside Pakistan. This strategy has been considered since the crisis of 2001-02 and was once dubbed the 'Cold Start' doctrine. There are several challenges to undertaking quick and limited incursions into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or other Pakistani territory, but two questions bulk large.

This strategy has been considered since the crisis of 2001-02 and was once dubbed the 'Cold Start' doctrine. There are several challenges to undertaking quick and limited incursions into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or other Pakistani territory, but two questions bulk large.First, how will India respond to an inevitable Pakistani military response and the ensuing escalation of fighting. The authors spend considerable time examining the claims that India needs to achieve 'escalation dominance': the capability to have the military upper hand at every rung of the 'escalatory ladder', which in turn would deter Pakistan from upping the ante. Not only is the acquisition of such capability difficult but also its efficacy cannot be guaranteed. The very idea of an 'escalatory ladder' is an oxymoron. The metaphor of an escalator suggests a certain inexorable quality: once you climb the escalator you can only get off at the top. Our political leadership has intuitively grasped this point better than many analysts in the strategic community.

Instead of getting the Pakistani state to sever ties with these groups, such a strategy may actually strengthen their links.

CHANDIGARH:Haryanagovernment'sGau Seva Ayoghas proposed a ""cow university"" to conduct exhaustive research on the domestic animal, its milk, urine and dung. The state had earlier drawn flak for the recent biryani policing in Mewat and the construction of a gaushala (cowshed) atMotilal Nehru School of SportsinSonipatdistrict.



Haryana Gau SevaAyogchairman Bhani Ram Mangla told TOI on Sunday that he would meet chief ministerManohar Lal Khattaron either Monday or Tuesday in connection with the proposal.



He said they would need 500 acres of land for the proposed university. ""We will look for a village panchayat willing to offer land for the university,"" said Mangla, who had recently visitedGandhinagar, Gujarat, to study the functioning of its Kamdhenu University , established in 2009 by the then Narendra Modi-headed BJP state government for research in veterinary and animal sciences, inclu ding dairies and fisheries.



Mangla said the proposed university in Haryana will deal with issues related only to cows. ""We want to conduct research on urine and dung of the cow,"" he said, adding that he wants the university to be able to offer diploma courses.



According to Mangla, opening the university in the state will boost the production of cow milk and create job opportunities for unemployed youth.



Earlier this month, the Ayog had ordered police to pick up samples of biryani from vendors in Muslim-dominated Mewat just ahead of Eid to check whether beef had been used. Criticism from locals, activists and opposition forced the CM to order an end to the food raids.

In contrast, according to Khandu, Modi was warm and an enthusiastic listener. “We had a long meeting and a serious exchange of ideas about Arunachal’s finances and how to speed up the state’s development. The PM was keen to learn about Arunachal’s problems and issues and came across as a person genuinely committed to the development of my state,” Khandu is **learnt** to have told his colleague.

  Jamie Dimon    as the chairman of JPMorgan is probably the only Wall Street chief to have weathered the Global Financial Crisis and guided his bank to the top rank. He doesn't mince words, be it the Fed's stance on interest rates, or policy makers who come up with strict rules that curb businesses. In an interview with ET, Dimon speaks his mind on issues ranging from the US elections to interest rates to China to the Indian economy. Edited excerpts:   



 



 Has India's image changed after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister? 



  I think so, and for the positive. You are the fastestgrowing country on the planet today and you are making changes. Politics is hard, but he is a successful and a strong leader and your foreign direct investment has doubled in the last four-five years.  



 



 India is a bright spot, but some would say that there is excessive self-congratulation. What is your view? 



  India is definitely a bright spot, it's not overdone. It is growing at 7%-plus, the deficit has gone down quite a bit, and the government has made changes which are conducive to future growth. All countries have economic cycles but it is quite a positive sign. I am not interested when people refer to a quarter or this year because the way I look at a country is what are its prospects over the next 20-30 years, and India's are good.  



 



 What convinced you about India's promise? 



  My first trip to India with JP Morgan was in 2004-05 when we were a smaller company. We covered 20 Indian companies in terms of research and we had 100 employees. Now we provide research on 120 companies and we distribute this globally. We continue to invest in our business here; and in the future, we will have 30,000 people in JP Morgan's Global Service Centre, which supports the firm globally in areas such as technology, security, programming and research. The GSC covers a whole gamut of services and it's still growing.  



 



 What about the Indian economy itself? 



  What you should also keep in mind is that you have a lot of successful companies in India. What makes these companies stand out is that they grew independently and weren't championed by the government.They grew because they are good at what they do in terms of offering their services around the world. If you compare this to other markets and countries, it took a lot of government support to have the companies they have now.  



 



  ALSO READ:    Not an exaggeration to call India sole bright spot: JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon   



 



 A lot of foreign banks in India are shrinking, but you are one of the few to have opened new branches... 



  We always take a long-term view on each market. We are not a fair-weather friend.We are here during the good times and the bad times and we want the Indian people and the Indian government to say that they are better off with JP Morgan being here and that they view JP Morgan as a consistent friend. There have been ups and downs since I have been coming here, but I don't worry about those ups and downs because we have our eye on the long term. We grow with countries as they grow and with companies as they grow. Our lending here is $2 billion and we have an asset-management arm investing $9 billion in India across asset classes and this will double or even triple over the next 15-20 years.  



 



 With regard to government and Reserve Bank of India policies on foreign banks, are there issues to be addressed? 



  It took us a long time to get our new branches, so I applaud Kalpana Morparia, our CEO for India. I think foreign investors should be able to hold more than 4.99% of an Indian bank. However, since JP Morgan is not moving into the retail business in India it's not a huge complaint. For the most part JP Morgan doesn't feel a lot of restrictions as it conducts business here.  



 



 If you had an opportunity to buy a large Indian private sector bank, which one would that be? 



  Remember our retail business is only in the US and it's very, very hard to compete in a business like retail in any other country. I couldn't open 100 branches here and be good at it. Local companies like ICICI Bank would eat us for breakfast just like it would be very hard for them to open retail over there. We are instead focused on the institutional business and helping large companies and governments.We help bank countries and companies around the world. For example, we just raised $3 billion in the sovereign bond market in a single day.  



 



 How do you look at the political leadership in various countries you invest vis-a-vis India? 



  India as you know has a very complicated political system. Ten years ago the thought that a Prime Minister would get a simple majority was beyond imagination.But I don't want to just compare India with other emerging market countries -look at Italy, they have had 50-60 Prime Ministers in the last 60 years. These things occur when democracies are set up. In America, we have a two-party system and the American constitution is a piece of brilliance but they did not know when they set it up we would just have a twoparty system. It just so happens that our electorate pushed towards the two-party system because it's a very good way to govern. If you have too many parties, it is very hard to achieve things that need to get done with regards to education, roads, hospitals and businesses. Politics is very hard in many different countries.  



 



 You are among the few from the world of finance who wants the Fed to raise interest rates. The markets warn against such a move. Why? 



  The market doesn't say anything. The market is just a bunch of people buying and selling every single day and countries don't have to have the same interest rates. If America is growing and America's unemployment is low, then it should have a monetary policy that is good for America; and if America is growing that's good for you too. Whether rates are 3% or 1%, growing should be more important to you than our interest rates. But interest rate movements affect financial markets...  



 



  The normalization of interest rates is a good thing, but 25 basis points in itself is irrelevant and everyone knows it. In the old days, rates going up was considered tightening, and when they tightened they took money out of the system. Today, they are just raising rates by dictating returns on reserves so I am not sure it's quite the same thing as tightening. They are not actually taking money out of the system. I think the riskier thing is using extraordinary monetary policy when you in fact don't need it. America has 4.9% unemployment, we have added 15 million jobs since the Great Recession. Household wages are going up, it's seen a 5% leap. We have a lot of good news and I don't see these potholes that will derail America. I don't think it would have mattered that much if they had raised the rates in September. I would have raised it.  



 



 What's your view on negative interest rates? 



  I personally don't like them and I am not sure they are going to work. It doesn't seem as if it has worked. Some very smart people think it has worked a little bit but it's like pushing string at its point. If you are a company, I cannot make you spend more money because rates are lower. I don't know of any business that has said they are going to build a new plant because rates are low. And savers have to save more money. I am not sure consumers spend more if you have low rates. You know this phenomenon in airplanes that the air flows one way and when it goes to high speed it flows the other way -that might be monetary policy.So I am not sure if zero works.  



 



  You have said you won't buy 10-year US treasuries...  



 



  I wouldn't and I have been right since I have said that.  



 



  So is that an indication of a bubble in this asset class?  



 



  I am always very careful. I look at probabilities. I think there is a high probability of people saying it's too low. Again we have added 15 million jobs, wages are going up, inflation is going up, there are no potholes and housing is in short supply. If you look at the buyers of 10-year bonds since QE (quantitative easing) started - it's the US government, the Chinese government, other governments, US banks, because there is a change in regulatory policy, and the so-called risk-off buyers who get scared and jump into 10-year. The first three have disappeared already. But when things get good, eventually there won't be people who are going to jump into a 10-year as a risk haven. The US treasury curve is not a real market unlike the credit curve of the world where you freely buy and sell and I think there is a quite high probability that it will go up more than what people think and it will be more volatile than what people think.  



 



  If someone Googles you, the first thing that pops up is your statement that you would like to be President.  



 



  I would love to be the President of United States and I think I would be good at it but it's too late and it is too hard.  



 



 You are younger than both Hillary and Trump by a long shot..  .

&gt; * CHANDIGARH: Haryana government's Gau Seva Ayog has proposed a ""cow university"" to conduct exhaustive research on the domestic animal, its milk, urine and dung.

&gt; * The state had earlier drawn flak for the recent biryani policing in Mewat and the construction of a gaushala (cowshed) at Motilal Nehru School of Sports in Sonipat district.Haryana Gau Seva Ayog chairman Bhani Ram Mangla told TOI on Sunday that he would meet chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on either Monday or Tuesday in connection with the proposal.He said they would need 500 acres of land for the proposed university.

&gt; * ""We will look for a village panchayat willing to offer land for the university,"" said Mangla, who had recently visited Gandhinagar , Gujarat, to study the functioning of its Kamdhenu University , established in 2009 by the then Narendra Modi-headed BJP state government for research in veterinary and animal sciences, inclu ding dairies and fisheries.Mangla said the proposed university in Haryana will deal with issues related only to cows.

&gt; * ""We want to conduct research on urine and dung of the cow,"" he said, adding that he wants the university to be able to offer diploma courses.According to Mangla, opening the university in the state will boost the production of cow milk and create job opportunities for unemployed youth.Earlier this month, the Ayog had ordered police to pick up samples of biryani from vendors in Muslim-dominated Mewat just ahead of Eid to check whether beef had been used.

___

  A quick online check reveals an economy class return ticket to London costs Rs 45,000 for next week. A business class ticket, which gets you flat beds, lounges and exotic wines, costs around Rs 2 lakh. However, even this mode of travel was not good enough for one AAP minister, going by news reports. He preferred to travel first class, which is a whopping Rs 4 lakh to London. Of course, ministers don't pay for these tickets themselves. They charge it to the government, so in effect, the taxpayer pays for it. The reason for travel (there have been other trips to Brazil, Finland and more) is often flimsy — random seminars, casual student body invites, anything that gets them out of the world's most polluted city I guess.  

 

  And, of course, first class is just more comfortable. You get four more inches of seat width and ten more inches of legroom. Most important, the wine selection is better. And there's more exclusivity. Even CEOs travel business class. First class is usually for billionaires, big movie stars and, of course, the great take-metro-to swearing-in-ceremony AAP.  

 

  This would all be really funny, if this were not real. This is about a real party that literally arose from the streets. This is about real Indians who gave AAP their trust and hope. We Indians stood up for corruption, threw out a scam-tainted government and backed a new party. A party who we thought would care for Indians. A party who wanted to show simplicity as a virtue.  

 

  The same party now plunders a poor nation's wealth to buy first-class tickets for fraudulent boondoggles. The leader of the party of course, watches all this, even as he points fingers and throws accusations at anyone else who dares criticize them.  

 

  No, AAP's shenanigans are no longer funny. It is one of the saddest moments in Indian politics. For, the AAP dream is shattered. The betrayal hurts. It is also uncomfortable to deal with. It tells us that it wasn't just the fault of the Congress. Perhaps we as a nation are full of cheats, liars, thugs and plunderers. It's just about getting the opportunity to do so. When AAP was on the street, it hated conspicuous consumption and waste of state resources. In power, it wants to travel first-class and sample Bordeaux wines. It shows that looting the nation never bothered these leaders of AAP. What bothered them was that they were not getting a chance to do so. Well, they have it now. Well done.  

 

  Already, several AAP ministers are tainted with charges ranging from corruption, rape and faking degrees. This abuse of office for personal luxury is just another example of one thing - AAP has failed. In fact, AAP is likely to become, if not already, worse than the existing political parties.  

 

  So what went wrong? Why did the Indian dream break? And what can we learn from it?  

 

  First, we created AAP when we were angry about immense corruption. We somehow assumed if there is a face we trust at the top, the party would never be corrupt. We were wrong. The lesson is this: to fix corruption, you need to make the government more accountable, not merely replace it or create new parties.  

 

  Second, the desire to win for AAP cost them everything. In the last Delhi elections, they selected candidates on one factor - winnability. The biggest asset of AAP, that they can make good people from society win, was gone. In fact, the good people were thrown out of the party. Looters, goons, rapists, frauds were invited in, as long as they could get some votes. AAP won, but lost its core - their values of integrity, ethics and honesty. And once the river is polluted, it is very hard to clean it again. Remember how people quit Apple and Google to join AAP? Do you hear of anyone else doing that lately? Never compromise an organization's core values - even if it means slower growth.  

 

  Finally, the lesson for all us Indians is to not give up hope. Yes, AAP took us for a first-class ride. It is a bitter truth to face. It doesn't, however mean, nothing can ever change in this country. We must move on, and work to keep any government accountable.  

 

  For AAP, the only lesson is to acknowledge reality and fix itself. Calling Modi names isn't going to make things any better. Taking a hard look within might. Maybe they could do that on their first class flights, as they hover high above Delhi over some nice, Aam Aadmi vintage wine.

[IMAGE 1](http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-54402957,width-310,resizemode-4,imglength-265699/9-states-stall-push-for-full-rural-connectivity-by-2019.jpg)

___

  NEW DELHI: Nine states seem to be holding back India's race to achieve full rural connectivity by 2019 with Assam, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Jharkhand topping the list, according to a central government assessment.  

 

  The fear is that the ambitious scheme may have to be pushed beyond 2019, a politically significant date as the Modi government will be up for re-election then, despite recent improvements having taken daily road construction to 130 km from the earlier average of around 85 km.  

 

  Besides the three worst performers, a review of 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana' (PMGSY) found progress wanting in Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Odisha, Uttarakhand and West Bengal, prompting a concerned rural development ministry to begin meeting chief secretaries of these states to urge them to step up the pace of work.  

 

  Some of the states, like J&amp;K; and Chhattisgarh, face obvious problems of terrain and terrorism. Development work in these states is a challenge and recurrent political turmoil in J&amp;K; makes the state even less effective. West Bengal is seen to lack admini strative efficiency while Odisha and Rajasthan have large backward areas. Bihar's road construction has improved but PMGSY records reveal more needs to be done.  

 

  The choice of 2019 to achieve full rural road connectivity is clearly linked to the political objective of presenting voters with a glowing report card ahead of Lok Sabha elections. While targets may have to be pushed forward owing to the drag of nine states, the question is if the Modi government will be able to do enough to make it count in its attempt to net the sprawling rural constituency .  

 

  The 2019 time-frame is daunting. As per estimates, Assam will have to scale up the pace of work by 10 times to take the length of road constructed per day from 2.3 km to 22.5 km. Only if roads are constructed at a rate of 22.5 kmday over three years will Assam be able to connect all rural habitations by 2019.  

 

  The chart of estimates drawn up for laggard states presents clear targets. Second on the list is J&amp;K; which has to take road construction from the present 1.3 km a day to 8 km; Jharkhand from 3.7 to 20.2; Odisha from 10.3 to 18.9; Uttarakhand from 3.3 to 7.7; West Bengal from 6.6 to 10 and Chhattisgarh from 5.1to 6.2.  

 

  A senior official said, ""The ministry has already met all states barring Bengal and J&amp;K.; We are urging them to raise the pace of work.There is no shortage of funds and there is no reason why states should not step up.""  

 

  Noticing that hill states are among those lagging behind, the Centre has decided to rope in Border Roads Organisation in Assam, Uttarakhand, J&amp;K; and Arunachal Pradesh.

---

&gt;* At a time when industrialists and bond markets are expecting rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in a low-inflation environment, central trade unions cited curtailing price rise as a major demand in calling an all-India strike earlier this month.

&gt;* Are unions being obdurate in refusing to acknowledge the basic statistical fact that at 5.1%, inflation is much lower today than what it used to be (8% plus) before the Narendra Modi government took over in May 2014?

&gt;* Mint has tried to address this issue by marrying consumption expenditure statistics given in the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) with disaggregated inflation figures for different commodities and services.

&gt;* Seen in this context, it is barely surprising that corporate India is demanding rate-cuts on account of low inflation, whereas Indias working class is protesting against rising prices at the same time.

&gt;* While it might be tempting to dismiss the protest by trade unions as obduracy in the face of much lower inflation than what it was a couple of years ago, their demands seem to be rooted in day-to-day experience rather than polemics.

&gt;* Bharatiya Janata Party strategists working in the Northeast gave a perfect birthday gift to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just a day before he turned 66.

&gt;* While speaking to the media, the tone and tenor of Chief Minister Pema Khandu suggested that he and other legislators were not left with any choice.

&gt;* Justifying the move, Khandu said a resource-stressed state like Arunachal could not afford to have political differences with the Centre if it needed funds for developmental activities.

&gt;* The present circumstances do not give us any space to overcome the burden of finances we had inherited, for which a decision in the larger interest of the state was compelling,"" he said.

&gt;* Calling the decision ""conscious and unanimous"", Khandu said the political developments in the state were beginning to hurt the interests of the people, and hoped that being an ally of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP initiative of which PPA is a part, will expedite the transfer of funds to Arunachal.

17 soldiers were killed in a terror attack at an army base in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri

New Delhi:   The bodies of the 17 soldiers killed in the terror attack at an army base in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri on Sunday are being flown back to their homes today. In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with top ministers to shape the government's response. Here are the latest developments in this big story:

Top sources said the government is clear there must be a calibrated response from India to the attack. India, the sources said, could raise the Uri attack at the United Nations General Assembly, which is in session in New York.Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar this morning briefed the Prime Minister, who is holding a review meeting with Mr Parrikar, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.Rajnath Singh held a separate meeting with Mr Parrikar and Army Chief Dalbir Singh, both of who visited Jammu and Kashmir yesterday after the attack, and other top officials.Early on Sunday morning, [four terrorists sneaked into the base](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/4-terrorists-who-attacked-army-base-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-uri-killed-combing-ops-on-1460052) firing AK-47s and throwing grenades, killing soldiers sleeping in tents that caught fire. Twenty soldiers were injured, seven of them critically.India has directly blamed Pakistan for the attack. ""[Pakistan is a terrorist state](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isolate-terrorist-state-pakistan-says-rajnath-singh-after-kashmir-attack-1460127) and it should be identified and isolated as such,"" Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, adding that the attackers were ""highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped"".Pakistan has rejected what it called ""[baseless and irresponsible accusations](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uri-attack-pakistan-says-indias-allegation-vitriolic-unsubstantiated-1460370)"" and said it was, ""deplorable that the Indian Minister chose to blame Pakistan for the incident even prior to conducting proper investigation.""The Army said there are clear signs that the terrorists belong to the Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Four AK-47 rifles, grenade launchers, a large number of grenades and food with Pakistani markings were found in search ops.The [attack happened during a change of command](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uri-attack-most-soldiers-killed-in-tent-fire-1460091) at the base and soldiers from two regiments - 6 Bihar and 10 Dogra - were present. 15 of the soldiers killed were from the Bihar regiment.[Two of the soldiers who died are from Jammu](http://www.ndtv.com/photos/news/india-pays-homage-to-soldiers-killed-in-uri-attack-22875), two from Jharkhand, three from Bihar, four from Uttar Pradesh, two from Bengal, three from Maharashtra and one from Rajasthan.The terrorists are believed to have crossed a canal along the Line of Control, cut through the fencing and infiltrated into Kashmir. The Uri camp could be observed from the hill tops across the border and it is likely that the terrorists were aware that the regiments were turning over, sources said.

&gt;* New Delhi: Shortly after the deadly terror attack in Uri, Indian PM Narendra Modi has promised everyone that he will take strong action against Pakistan.

&gt;* Initially we thought strong condemnation by our home minister Mr Rajnath Singh would be enough but when we came to know about the scale of the tragedy, we decided that only words will not suffice.

&gt;* The nation is angry at this loss of lives of our soldiers and looks up to Mr Modi for action and we have decided to act.

&gt;* We initially thought about boycotting the birthday party completely but that reaction would have been slightly too strong, the official added.

&gt;* These planned moves have already shaken Nawaz Sharif and he has clarified once again through the press that Pakistan PM is not responsible for Pakistans action.

&gt;* Four commando-style gunmen, armed with AK-47 assault rifles and grenades, burst into the brigade headquarters in Uri at 5:30 a.m. (midnight GMT) and were killed after a three-hour gunfight, a senior Indian army officer said.

&gt;* He had informed his Pakistani counterpart of his findings, which linked the attack on Uri to a similar raid in January on an Indian Air Force base in Punjab that India also blames on Jaish-e-Mohammed.

&gt;* Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and the army chief of staff headed to Uri, roughly halfway between Indian Kashmir's summer capital Srinagar and Islamabad, to investigate the attack.

&gt;* ""There are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped,"" Singh said in a series of strongly-worded tweets that were confirmed as genuine by his office.

&gt; Many separatists who had given up  arms and taken peaceful ways to fight for freedom have openly on TV been saying that if Modi wants violence we can show what violence is.  

Let's take them up on their threat. Make it very clear to the people of kashmir that this policy of supporting separatists is what is getting them killed. Engage with those who want to talk, kill those that want to fight. 

&gt;An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.

It is surprising that the party that is more powerful is shirking away from a conflict. It is this reluctance that is seen as a weakness by our opponents. 

We also need to up our game in shaping the opinion of the common kashmiri. Fight the separatists in the media, fight them in schools, fight them in the minds of the common man in kashmir.

&gt;* Indians revealed an overwhelmingly positive and confident view of their place in the world and Modis foreign policy received a general thumbs-up in the survey.

&gt;* Though only 23% felt India should help other countries, a reminder that the countrys domestic problems remain top of the mind, 46% said improving human rights globally should be an important foreign policy goal.

&gt;* This sentiment is strongest among BJP supporters who on average are 11 percentage points more concerned about China than Congress backers, especially in regards to Chinas military power.

&gt;* The world leader in the making who fares worse than Xi Jinping with the Indian public is US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

&gt; * If the September 17attack on an Army camp in Uri is a reminder of the military challenge India still confronts in Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modis move to be more assertive on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK), including Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), is a significant if belated addition to the Indian diplomatic armoury.

&gt; * To comprehend the matter in its entirety, it is essential to refer to four important documents: (i) Kashmirs Instrument of Accession to India, signed on October 26, 1947, (ii) UNSC Resolution number 47 of 1948 on Kashmir, (iii) the Simla Agreement of1972 and (iv) the 1994 Parliament of India Resolution on Kashmir

&gt; * After succeeding in asserting its total control over PoK, Pakistan turned its eye towards the Kashmir Valley and Jammu, and commenced instigating, aiding, and abetting all the trouble there particularly in the Valley  which it continues to pursue, unabated, till date.

&gt; * Indias long inertia vis-a-vis PoK has led to the creation of a negative mindset among a large section of Indians who feel that any dialogue on Kashmir with Pakistan means talking only about the Valley of Kashmir, which with India.

127,"What is really worrying is that it isn't just merchandise exports which are shrinking but even service exports(!). This has traditionally been India's strength. Remember that services being exported are high-skill types of jobs, so it means that even the elite sectors of the Indian economy are struggling.

I don't think just devaluing the currency is enough, however. It's a cheap tactic. I'm reading TN Ninan's book on the Indian economy and he goes through with very high level of detail, sector by sector, what is ailing each and everyone of them.

He makes the point that labour costs or currency costs are not going to determine export performance. There will always be a cheaper country than India(Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia). Indian weakness is exports have to be tied to weak infrastructure, poor power supply(or at least more expensive due to high subsidies), poor logistics and so on. These are legacy issues of which there are no quick fixes. The Modi government is doing its levelbest to fix them, but even in the best case scenario, we won't see the results of this for quite a number of years.

Also, it's not like the competition is standing still either, so the improvement has to be faster than what the others are doing.

Anyway, there will be a reaction sooner or later. I can sense that the government will try to isolate Pakistan regionally and internationally and allow local area commanders to carry out surgical strikes across the LoC. The latter was done after one of our jawans was beheaded, away from the media glare. It will happen again without Arnab giving you live updates. 

One thing to keep in mind here is that it is not the political will alone which can evoke a reaction. There has to be military preparedness as well. MMS wanted surgical air and ground strikes across LoC after 26/11 only to be told by the then Air Chief that they did not have the intel of training camps and by the then Army Chief that his men were not ready. I am hoping that our political brass took a lesson from that and ensured that the next time something like this happened, our forces were ready with precise target location. I hope they are ready now. 

But what is really sad is across social media I can see a section of AAP/Congress supporters who look 'happy' that something like this has happened because for them the incident is an outcome of Modi's poor foreign policy or that a non-reaction from the government will dent his strong man image.

153,"With 18 Soldiers Dead, Modi Faces Pressure to Strike Pakistan

---

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces pressure to launch a military response against suspected terrorist training camps inside Pakistan, after militants killed 18 Indian soldiers in disputed Kashmir.

&gt;* One immediate option before India is launching artillery attacks and covert raids across the so-called Line of Control, the defacto border separating Indian- and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir -- a Himalayan region claimed by both countries in full.

&gt;* Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at Kings College London, said given the high casualty count, India is likely to retaliate across the Line of Control via covert maneuvers.

&gt;* Pant said Pakistan was continuing efforts to internationalize the Kashmir issue to gain attention ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, at which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is expected to speak.

&gt;* ""As in the past, Pakistan will deny any involvement with the Uri attack, say that if India resolved the Kashmir issue there would be no terrorism and seek the attention of the major powers for its stance,"" said Husain Haqqani, who was Pakistans envoy to the U.S. from 2008 to 2011.

&gt; * At the meeting where External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was conspicuously absent, the top security brass briefed the Prime Minister on the prevailing ground situation in Kashmir Valley in the wake of the terror attack at a Brigade Headquarters in Uri, the sources said.

164,"&gt;Modi was no different and his initial 'saree' diplomacy looks stupid now.

Does it? Modi's initial attempts at diplomacy with Pakistan were to ensure that peace was given a chance. Once that failed, the steady build-up of pressure against Pakistan began. The flurry of activity related to Balochistan wasn't sudden and reflexive. It was a careful upping of the ante. It sent Pakistan a clear message: keep messing with India and we'll create trouble for you in your own backyard.

Now read the statements Ashraf Ghani has made in recent times. And you'll see the signs of an emerging pattern. The Afghan president act bold without good reason.

What has Pakistan's response been? Attacking an administrative base in Kashmir. Tell me, which one has a greater long-term impact? The institution of a policy to put Pakistan on the backfoot using Balochistan and Afghanistan, or a single strike that kills 17 soldiers? What, pray tell, did the killing of seventeen soldiers achieve? The loss of lives is tragic, but the bottom line is, it's a drop in the bucket, if that. It doesn't change the strategic situation one bit, and it doesn't even _begin_ to dent the Army's capability to enforce peace on India's terms in Kashmir or elsewhere.

Also, note that the attack happened just two days ago. And assorted bellyachers (in the mainstream media, on the social media, and also on Reddit) are already either (a) whining about how India is ""weak"" on terror, or (b) as you pointed out using the tragic deaths as a tool to score political points. At least give the government some time to take stock of the situation and come up with a response!?

Speaking of which, you know what stands out to me the most? After uttering the usual stuff (""we condemn the attack"", ""Pakistan is a terror sponsor"", etc.) with what seemed to be an air of boredom, the political leadership and military brass have gone silent. There's _nothing_ being said anymore. It's almost as if they have a response planned, and they're working on putting it in action. What that response would be is anyone's guess.

&gt;MMS wanted surgical air and ground strikes across LoC after 26/11 only to be told by the then Air Chief that they did not have the intel of training camps and by the then Army Chief that his men were not ready

Quite the opposite. A senior IAF officer at the time announced that the IAF had [5,000 targets](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081225/jsp/frontpage/story_10299108.jsp) marked out for attack. MMS never gave the go-ahead ... he abhorred the mere thought of offensive military action. And at the time, he was right. There was nothing to gain from a war.",2016-09-20 10:25:28

 By Nida Najar 

 

  NEW DELHI: More than two years into his tenure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to have broad support in India, despite criticism over stalled economic reforms and religious and caste tensions in the country, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center.  

 

  The report, which was published Monday, found that 81 per cent of Indians had a favorable view of Modi in 2016, down from 87 per cent the year before. It also found that, even among supporters of the Indian National Congress party, the main opposition group, a majority had a positive view of Modi and of his Bharatiya Janata Party.  

 

  ""When I talk to Indian elites, including the press, there's this sense of frustration that Modi hasn't lived up to expectations,"" Bruce Stokes, author of the report and director of global economic attitudes at the Pew Research Center, said in a telephone interview. ""We don't really see that in public opinion.""  

 

  Rather, he said, ""it seems that the public is still enamored of Modi.""  

 

  Modi swept into power in 2014 on a wave of public support for his development agenda and on disaffection with the previous governing coalition, led by the Congress party. Though economic changes have been intermittent, partly because of lack of support in Parliament from other parties, eight in 10 Indians have a positive view of the economy, and about two-thirds are satisfied with the way things are going in India generally, according to the survey.  

 

  Part of the good will could be explained by the country's economic growth; an annual rate of 7.1 percent for the most recent quarter makes India's the fastest-growing large economy in the world. But significant economic alterations, including those regarding land acquisition and labor, which are seen as crucial for modernizing India's economy and expanding its formal workforce, have stalled because of lack of support in Parliament. In one sign of progress, however, the government in August pushed through the Goods and Services Tax, a uniform code that should do away with overlapping state and federal taxes, helping to unify the economy.  

 

  ""People are not willing to give up on him on the economy so quickly,"" said Shekhar Gupta, a journalist and political commentator, adding that Modi's frequent speaking engagements may have helped bolster his popularity. ""After a long time, Indians have a leader who's speaking to them directly and speaking to them all the time.""  

 

  The pollsters interviewed 2,464 randomly selected adults from April 7 to May 24 in 15 states and in New Delhi, the capital. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  

 

  Though many expressed support for Modi and for his party, increasing polarization between backers of Bharatiya Janata and those of the Congress party was apparent in the survey. Those differences were particularly stark on domestic issues like corruption, unemployment and help for the poor, where support from Congress party backers for Modi's efforts has fallen since last year.  

 

  One of the main criticisms of Modi has been his apparent reticence to confront instances of intolerance. In recent months, there has been an increase in reports of violence from self-appointed cow protection groups, which have proliferated under his tenure. Cows are holy animals in Hinduism, and their slaughter is illegal in much of India. Last year, a Muslim man was killed after rumors that he had slaughtered a cow and eaten beef. After an attack on four Dalits, members of India's lowest caste, in Gujarat state, Modi spoke out against the violence.  

 

  But such episodes, while provoking criticism among the country's intellectuals, appear to carry less weight with the public, according to the survey. About half of the respondents viewed ""communal incidents,"" or tensions between religions or castes, as a very serious problem, but the issue ranked behind others such as corruption, crime, terrorism and unemployment.

NEW DELHI: The growing pressure onPM Narendra Modi+toact against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism+after theUri attack+seems to be reflecting in the responses of his ministers.



A day after BJP presidentAmit Shahtalked about the need to punish Pakistan, junior foreign ministerVK Singhsaid he was absolutely confident that the PM would give a tough response to Pakistan's latest provocation. Another minister, Jitendra Singh, said people wanted the Modi government to act firmly.



The pressure from within to ""act firmly"" could also be a manifestation of the expectation triggered by angry anti-Pakistan statements issued by Modi and others in the BJP in the runup to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and even earlier. Modi used to come down heavily on the UPA after every terror attack or even clashes on the border.



Perhaps mindful of that, senior ministers, including home ministerRajnath Singhand finance minister Arun Jaitley, have held Pakistan responsible for the Uri attack. Shah went on to the extent of saying that India was prepared for a final onslaught against terror.



Even RSS weighed in, with Suresh Bhiyyaji Joshi saying the terrorists, their masters and their supporters should be dealt with firmly and conclusively. V K Singh, a formerArmychief, said, ""Having seen the Army closely, I feel it needs to be analysed as to what happened there... It needs to be investigated how the incident took place and what was the lacuna. From the Army's side, alertness is required. The Kashmir situation needs to be thought about. Action has to be taken without getting influenced by emotions, anger. It has to be taken coolly and with proper planning.""

174,"A lot of threads and opinions floating around on how to deal with Pakistan. Hardcore bhakts demanding that India go to war and take back PoK, ""end this once and for all"", or ""surgical strikes"". Strangely none of them actually seem to realize that Pakistan is a nuclear state which has the capability to strike any part of India with nuclear weapons. Those who are opposed to the current regime don't seem to have any solutions or even want to make an attempt at one. They are busy taking potshots and scoring cheap points by trolling said bhakts.

Anyway, here is my inexpert opinion. This may not solve the problem but would definitely forward our interests.

1. **We must realize that there are weakness in our own security apparatus.** We must harden our own defenses. For example, during the Pathankot attack the terrorists came in through routes used by drug smugglers. They had a mole within the BSF and/or the Punjab Police. What steps have we taken to plug such leaks? Has the government initiated some scheme to make smuggling more difficult? This would alleviate Punjab drug problem as well as deny an easy route in to terrorists. Because next time they may not choose to attack a military base.
2. **Improve coordination between intelligence agencies and give them more powers.** This was one of the reasons why 26/11 could not be prevented even though we had some inkling about it. Give the agencies more powers to act. I cannot give much details, but every analyst I have read believes that Indian establishment hampers the intelligence agencies. And there are definite intelligence failures for all to see.
3. **Talking with Pakistan is fruitless.** IMO, we must completely purge ourselves of the moronic, and idiotic impulse of *Aman Ki Asha*. It is a ridiculous fantasy. At the same time I am not saying we replace that with cries for war, but purge yourself of it. I used to think that perhaps there is some hope. But there is none. After reading *Fighting to the End* and Haqqani's books, there is no way there can be peace between India and Pakistan until the Military-Mosque nexus in that country is broken. You cannot do that by invading it. That would only make them more religious (like happened in Arab countries) and give more powers to the generals. They have lost every War, and their military despite having more advanced equipment, has suffered some seriously humiliating defeats even when they had advantage of numbers, and yet every Pakistani firmly believes that they have *won every war* and that Pak Army can do no wrong. In this like all PM's Modi has done his part, he has extended the hand of friendship multiple times or else the narrative in international and domestic media would have been: *Anti-Muslim PM refuses to talk with Pakistan*. So it was more important for Modi to at least appear to make an attempt, more so than MMS or Vajpayee.
4. **So what should we do? I am not a hawk but I am no dove either.** We need to isolate Pakistan on the international forum. They have done quite a lot of it on their own. But we need to sustain the pressure. The narrative that Pakistan has spun over the last 70 years is just absolutely stunning. They have painted us as the aggressors. when people talk about intolerance and genocide they think Godhra (which by any standard was not a genocide, though horrible). Not the daily kidnappings and rape of Hindu women, just because they are Hindus. Not how the number of Hindus has dwindled sharply in Pak and Bangladesh. Not how Ahmadis are *Wajib-ul-Qatl* in Pakistan. How Sunni militias go around bombing and killing Shias and other minority Muslim sects. We need to expose this side. And yes that means sucking up to Western nations. Some of it won't even require too much effort. Jamat-ud-Dawa, Sipah-i-Sahaba etc. collect money for Jihad in India and against the West openly. We need to make a cyber team that can track links between militants groups and money and track it back to Pakistan Army and society. This info should be released, not just after attacks on Indian soil but regularly to sustain pressure.
4. **Do not back off Balochistan!** Too many people who dislike Modi are demanding it simply because they do not like the messenger. I believe these policy decisions aren't made just out of the blue from the PMO. But these options are presented to every PM by the state agencies after careful consideration. Some choose to take it others do not. Once again, this does not mean we support their Independence or fuel an armed rebellion. We cannot do the latter, the geography does not permit it. It merely means that we keep highlighting the issue as shrilly and as loudly as possible at every single forum. Make no mistake, Pakistan has embarked on an operation to completely wipe out the Balochis. They are already training Mujaheddin who are loyal to the state and will fight the nationalist insurgents. Quetta Shura is no accident. The area is being handed over to JuD to do da'wa and recruit people their. Punjabis are also settling in the area changing the demographics. India needs to highlight these. I do not know how much it will help the Baloch but it will definitely forward our cause.
5. **Help Afghanistan.** I feel this maybe a lost cause, but nevertheless we must make a sincere attempt. In this we will have the West and also IMO the Iranians on our side. They despise the Taliban and would help us. No need to actually send spies or anything here. Just by being here we trigger every Pakistani and they keep supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda due to their irrational fears further damaging their standing in the West, and also permanently damaging their society by sheltering such elements.
6. **Isolate that country on all multi-lateral fora.** I mean what are we actually going to do there? Sling some more shit at them while they shovel some towards us? This is exactly what happened at NAM and what will happen at the UNGA. The mood in Pakistan is that SAARC etc. is dead anyway. They are looking towards CPEC and China as their savior. SAARC is just one more platform where they can butt in and disrupt whenever India tries to take up a leadership role. One more place where they will need to endure Indian leadership and listen to nagging from us *Baniyas* in form of economic integration, development etc. Instead, India should look for sub regional partnership. The recent BBIN initiative is a great example. By completely removing Pakistan all of other nations can concentrate on things that matter: more regional integration, intelligence sharing for anti-terror activities etc. India should simply create a BBIN summit under the ostensible purpose to review the progress of this initiative and invite Sri Lanka and Afghanistan as ""observers"" and undermine and isolate Pakistan. It can always deal with the last two countries as part of India-Iran-Afghanistan grouping and as part of Maldives-Seychelles-Sri Lanka-India quadrilateral and forward our interests in that way. India's interests in those groupings are also similar. If you see the countries that fall under these groups, they have quite a lot of similarities. Much more than the so called descendants of Bin Qasim and the Central Asians tribes have with us lowly South Asians anyway.

This is what I think would be a proactive approach to that would actually help us. Not only will it make it more costly to do such attacks, but any such attacks will further isolate it. Whether they are sanctioned by the military or not. We cannot succumb to the doves and just reopen dialogue. Whenever that happens there is too much hype and as the more mature nation, onus is on India to somehow carry through the talks. Previous governments did not have this approach as everyone tried to talk to them. I would be disappointed if Modi were to initiate military action. The only people who would actually be happy with this would be crazy Sanghis and Modi's detractors who will wish him failure at every step of the offensive, Indian soldiers be damned.",2016-09-20 11:25:02

This is about the sustained attacks from Pakistan-sponsored terrorists such as Jaish-e-Mohd, LeT, open support to anti-India elements like Dawood Ibrahim, and their hostile / duplicious stance on Indian Kashmir since 1947, but especially since militancy / Hindu ethnic cleansing in the valley since the 1990s. 

The question is, is this the straw that breaks the camel's back? 

No one has ever questioned, much less penalised, Pakistan for their clear policy of rearing terrorists, minority extermination, and proxy war against India in particular etc. Their policy is to break-up and their wet dream is Islamisation of India. If Pakistan doesn't like the way this is headed, then they need to examine their whole 'wajood': that of being anti-India.

204,"It’s been barely eight months and India was attacked by terrorists yet again on 18 September at a battalion headquarters of the Army in north Kashmir's Uri town.

210,"Sweet bhakt..mind your language. His approach towards Kashmir has already created the worst internal strife to grip the valley in the last 25 years and his flip-flop Pakistani diplomacy of visiting Nawaz Sharif and then inviting Pakistani investigators for Pathankot and then raising Balochistan issue is the worst that has been witnessed.
Also, he is the first PM to drive foreign policy by making the foreign minister as a mere rubber stamp. Pathetic to say the least and not inviting his For. Min in the CCS meeting.


Modi took full advantage of the grief and rage among Indians when similar attacks on Army personnel took place and instead being United went on an all out offensive on the govt and baited the former PM with most third class rhetoric , all of which was not possible and is not possible today.
Difference is  - people construed all of that to be true. He spoke of his chest size and similar logic - free rhetoric that was lapped up by the media and people alike. 
We are already seeing media coming to his help, by putting out positive headlines  - like ""militants killed"" right on the top page. The headline management has already started and this attack will again be forgotten. And please understand that i do not support Congress or any other party actively , but I am just fed up of the glorification of a regular political leader who has such positive approval ratings

211,"I have a different take on this.

Pakistan Govt. and Army both know how small they are. They indeed know that Indian army(Just army) can do whatever the hell they want with Pakistan. Of course loses will be there. Heavy losses in Indian side. But we are ok with it. 

However, what pakistan is doing is playing right into the big boys plans. US, UK or whatever. Pakistan need to punch above its weight. To be taken seriously. Honestly. Look at your defense procurements. Everything for free or handouts. Even the JF-17 is chinese with green paint. Say whatever you want for LCA. Its a different beast of its own. There is R&amp;D, industry, supplier chains (including L3 level) in India itself. How do you guys manage it? By projecting itself as regional power. How to do it? Punch your neighbor. Give him thousand cuts or whatever the name it goes by now. US and UK can afford to give you the yearly 3 or 5 Billion USD and thats it. You guys give staging area, drone base, ELNIT base and what not. Pakistan sits at one of the most strategic locations in Asia. Its literally a gateway. The CPEC that every pakistan is so proud of, is a gateway. owned and operated by china. (Its beyond every Indian's thought why that 50 billion USD project is a big deal for you guys). You need to tussle with the biggest boy in the playground. India doesnt have hard power. You do. Last we had a strong PM, 71 happened. Don't think even Modi can match balls with Indira Gandhi. Enuff said.

Its not about nationalism. We want to live peacefully. Yes IA is killing indians in Kashmiris. You want to stop that? Tell them to put their arms down. J&amp;K alone cannot do the plebiscite. It includes J&amp;K, PoK, Azad Kasmir and the Aksai Chin you guys gave to China. What did we do? Why should we die for your ideology.?

Pakistan can afford to go to war with India. Because you are not going to pay for it. Someone else will. Your government and army HQ knows that well.

---

&gt;* wrote William Shakespeare, and over the next 400-odd years, the world agreed that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

&gt;* This is evident from the political slugfest that's currently going on between Punjab and Haryana over the naming of the Chandigarh International Airport, which finally became operational with a flight to Sharjah last week.

&gt;* This time around, it is the Punjab government, led by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, which has hijacked the issue by coming out with full page advertisements in newspapers containing the name 'Mohali International Airport'.

&gt;* This is not the first time that the naming of the Chandigarh airport has become a political issue between Punjab and Haryana, which share the Union Territory as their capital.

&gt;* This had come after six months of squabbling, ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the civil air terminal on 11 September 2015.

It's not just about the criminal being dangerous. The other problem with being a bystander and helping is that if somehow the perpetrator is very well connected/rich, he will buy off the cops and the girl herself and both parties will accuse you and get you convicted of being the rapist/murderer. The evidence will be fabricated, witnesses will be conjured out of thin air. Until the situation with police corruption and incompetence and the slow and unjust legal system is dealt with, these things will continue. The problem is that politicians rely heavily on the legal and law enforcement system being the way it is, so they don't want to change it either. 

Best short term option is to just study your ass off instead of wasting your time on social media, get into IIT, jet your ass off to the US and let the animals enjoy their jungle and keep waiting for ache din.

It works on the basis of the Cauvery Tribunal Verdict. The final verdict can be found [here](http://wrmin.nic.in/writereaddata/Inter-StateWaterDisputes/FINALDECISIONOFCAUVERYWATERTRIBUNAL4612814121.pdf).

There are couple of important points here:
1) The Clause 7 says: 
  In case the yield of Cauvery basin is less in a distress year, the allocated
shares shall be proportionately reduced among the States of Kerala,
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Union Territory of Pondicherry

2) The Clause 16 says:
Domestic and municipal: By 20 per cent of the quantity of water
Water supply diverted or lifted from the river or any of
its tributaries or from any reservoir,
storage or canal.

Karnataka is fucked because it failed to bind to both the above clauses. 

Had it been voluntarily sharing the proportional water with TN, TN wouldn't have even filed the petition with SC. That is mistake#1. 

Had it not diverted more that 20% of water for domestic purposes (the new bangalore Cauvery water supply project). There will be water in KRS now. This has been proved in the Court by TN and This is mistake#2.

Karnataka is fucked not because SC is taking revenge or Modi is fucking with it or TN is fucking with it. Karnataka is fucked because it has been legally careless right from the beginning of this issue. Apparently they were not even able to provide clear data on how much water is there in each reservoirs. It is fucked because of careless bureaucracy.This is not at all surprising to me because i have lived in Bangalore for 12 years now and i have seen how careless the offices are here. My father is a retired TN state government employee in registrations and he was appalled by the way the registrations are done in Bangalore. He was also shocked by the way RTO offices are run by the agents. Take a look at this latest RajaKalave or Akrama Sakarama problem, you will see how careless the bureaucracy in this state is. 

SC does not go by the feelings of people. It goes by the data. As far as i see, Karnataka did a shitty work in providing data and maintaining SC orders. Hence it is fucked. But people like Vattal Nagaraj and Kannada Prakash benefit from this. The politicians also benefit from this big time. So at the end of day, politicians, rioters, anti social elements benefit from this issue and the people are fucked in their ass with a fresh cactus plant dipped in a highly priced motor oil.",2016-09-21 06:19:35

New Delhi:  Around 2,000 Central government organisations will soon be accepting applications under the Right to Information (RTI) Act through online medium.

  

The move is based on the suggestion given by a group of secretaries before Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

  

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has started a massive exercise to train nodal officers of all such public authorities who have not yet started accepting the RTI pleas online.

 

In a stern directive, it has asked all the government departments to attend a workshop being organised by the DoPT in this regard ""without fail"". In case, the officers concerned fail to attend the workshop, a username will be created suo-motu and all these public authorities will be made live on the RTI portal.

 

As many as 690 public authorities have been aligned so far on the especially designed website -- www.rtionline.gov.in -- to enable online filing of the RTI applications.

  

The DoPT had during June and July this year conducted a workshop for 330 public authorities. Of these, 51 nodal officers did not attend the workshop.

  

Since all the public authorities (around 2,000)  will have to be aligned in a time bound manner (a target/timeline fixed and monitored at the highest level), DoPT is organising yet another training workshop as a special drive for those defaulted public authorities and nodal officers who did not attend the workshop

  

It requested that all nodal officers under 51 public authorities attend the workshop without fail on Tuesday, the DoPT said in the order.

  

It may be noted by all concerned that no further opportunity would be given to the nodal officers after this workshop, the order said.

  

In case the concerned nodal officer is unable to attend this training, the username will be created suo-motu and the concerned public authority will be made live on the RTI online portal with effect from September 30, by DoPT, it said.

  

The RTI Act, 2005, enables a citizen to seek tome-bound reply on governance related matters.  People can also make payment of RTI fee online.

  

On the occasion of completion of more than 10 years of implementation of the RTI Act, the Central Information Commission is going to hold annual convention in October, the DoPT said.

Chandigarh: Music composer Vishal Dadlani, who was lacerated for his sarcastic tweet on Jain monk Tarun Sagar last month, met the spiritual leader at his ashram in Chandigarh on Wednesday to deliver his latest apology.



 
This is his third overture towards the monk after he apologized on Twitter and then in an open letter for his tweets describing the monk's address to the Haryana assembly as ""monkery"".



 
""Guruji accepted my apology, he has forgiven me and I think we've also developed a bond of friendship,"" the singer-composer told reporters after the meeting.  
  
  



Show Full Article

 
""I have realised a lot about myself in the last 10 days. I have come here as my eyes have been opened,"" he said.



 
Mr Dadlani quit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) after his tweet was sharply condemned by Arvind Kejriwal and other party leaders.



 
The 43-year-old announced that he would only work for social causes.



 
He also deleted his tweets but could not escape the intense backlash, especially from followers of Tarun Sagar, widely referred to as ""Maharaj-ji"".



 
Mr Dadlani was accused of hurting Jain sentiment in a police complaint filed on August 29.



 
""I did not come here to talk about the case,"" he said today.



 
Mr Dadlani recently also put out an open letter addressed to Tarun Sagar and Jains. ""As a concerned Indian, I should have been especially careful to be sensitive to the sentiments of followers of Muni Tarun Sagar ji. Especially after receiving his forgiveness, I realise what a magnanimous and generous heart he has, and what strength lies within the gentleness of the Jain people,"" he wrote.



 
He described the monk as ""gentle and kind"" and said he was ""hurt and disappointed"" with himself and his ego. ""It is that same ego that I hope to defeat, with your help. I apologise again, from the depths of my heart, and ask that Muni-ji and all my Jain brothers and sisters, forgive me,"" Mr Dadlani said in his letter.Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelatedAAP Legislator Amanatullah Khan, Accused Of Sexual Harassment, ArrestedMore StoriesWhy Modi Must Continue Showing Patience With PakNo Liquor Rule Absurd, CCTV Regressive, Says Supreme Court On Dance BarsCar Hits Man, Keeps Going With Body On Roof For 3 km In Telangana's Mahbubnagar

  BENGALURU: H D Deve Gowda, the only Karnataka chief minister to have managed to resolve a Cauvery crisis through talks overseen by then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao, says it is not the Supreme Court or the Cauvery supervisory committee but the union government which has to sort the current interstate problem between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  

 

  In an interview to Sowmya Aji of ET, ahead of the supervisory committee meet on Monday and an apex court hearing on Tuesday, he said: ""Tamil Nadu has always won its case because of its ability to apply political pressure. Only the union government can ensure there is no further injustice to Karnataka. This state is the only one in the South which elected a BJP government, shouldn't they do something to help it?""  

 

 What is the way forward on the Cauvery imbroglio? 

  Deve Gowda: We have no water in the state, the storage in our Cauvery basin reservoirs (less than 29 TMCFT on Saturday) is inadequate to meet the drinking water needs of Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya till June (requirement 30 TMCFT). The Supreme Court ordered us to release whatever we have left to save the samba, which is the third crop in a year raised by Tamil Nadu farmers. This is being done. How is this justice? The court and the supervisory committee will only follow the language of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal award, which we have contested. In this situation, only the union government can ensure there is no further injustice to Karnataka.  

 

 Karnataka's BJP leaders insist that the Prime Minister has no role to play as the dispute is before the Supreme Court. 

  Deve Gowda: The union government has got notices to respond to the special leave petition that Karnataka has filed against the tribunal award in the Supreme Court. Of course, they have a role. As PM in 1996, I called the chief ministers of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra at the height of Medha Patkar's agitation against river Narmada dams. We discussed and sorted out the issue of what the dams height should be and the project went forward. I personally met environmentalist Sundarlal Bahuguna, went to villages around the Tehri dam in Uttarakhand, ensured landslide-resistant technology so that the dam could come up. Why can't the union government do something about Cauvery in the same spirit?  

 

 Chief minister Siddaramaiah has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to convene a meeting with Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa. 

  Deve Gowda: She may not agree. It is her nature. What I want is for the union government to make its stand clear on the matter. Right from the British period, Tamil Nadu has had more political clout and their ability to apply political pressure has ensured they always win their case. Karnataka is the only state in the South which elected a BJP government. (Union minister) Ananthkumar is a six-term MP from Bengaluru. They have 288 MPs in Lok Sabha. Shouldn't they do something to help Karnataka?  

 

 In 1995, another distress year, how did you as the Karnataka CM manage to release lesser water to Tamil Nadu? 

  Deve Gowda: Everyone is talking now of how S Bangarappa, in 1991, passed an ordinance that Cauvery belonged to Karnataka. That was struck down and we got a lot of hostility and abuse from the Supreme Court as well as in the national arena because of it.That is not the way. In 1995, we were asked to release 30 TMCFT, but there was no water. PM Narasimha Rao convened a meeting of CMs and opposition leaders. All of us went, all of them also had come. She (J Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu CM) had brought a bundle of dried paddy from some corner of some field. I gave a CD to the PM. We had gathered visual evidence of how much water was there in the TN dams and what condition their crops were in. She got up and walked out. Rao asked us to release a total of 11 TMCFT then.  

 

 Why has this not been done in the other distress years that Karnataka faced? 

  Deve Gowda: Neither (S M) Krishna in 2002 nor (Jagadish) Shettar in 2012 tried the method I did. Our experience in Karnataka has been bitter, as there is no political unity on this issue, unlike in Tamil Nadu. Whether it is DMK or AIADMK, they unite on the cause of Cauvery. Here, I have seen what has happened each time and didn't want Siddaramaiah to go through the same thing. So I said please release the water as demanded. What do we gain by the bandhs or burning vehicles? Only losses. We need political unity and pressure.  

 

     Your son and JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy has said your party will not allow a drop of water to be released to Tamil Nadu.    

    Deve Gowda:    I am speaking as a former PM, not as the head of a political party. He is looking at political realities at the ground level.  

 

 Union minister Ananthkumar     has said the state needs to do more homework and present its case better to the Supreme court and the Cauvery supervisory committee.    

    Deve Gowda:    The same (Fali S) Nariman was our advocate in 1995. He told me we should release 5 TMCFT of water before a Supreme court hearing for 30 TMCFT. I didn't call an all party meeting, I took a tough decision as CM and ordered release of water then also. It worked in our favour, though the opposition led by BJP's B S Yeddyurappa staged a dharna in the assembly. The tribunal award was given by a divided bench and it is full of injustice against Karnataka. Until that is resolved, the Supreme Court will just follow its language.

269,"Gujarat set to bring new anti-dissent law, cops can arrest on mere suspicion

---

&gt;* Paranoid about its desire to crush any sort of dissent, the BJP government in Gujarat is now toying with the idea of bringing in one more law to nip its critics in the bud.

&gt;* The GujCTOC, which the new law seeks to imitate, was the bone of contention between Chief Minister Narendra Modi and the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre for many years.

&gt;* The BJP government has failed in three previous attempts to bring in a law similar to the present draft, tentatively titled the Gujarat Protection of Internal Security Act (GPISA).

&gt;* Since 2003, when it was first passed by the Gujarat Legislative Assembly with Narendra Modi as the Chief Minister, this legislation was sent back twice for dilution - by President APJ Abdul Kalam and by his successor President Pratibha Patil - precisely because the stringent provisions violated basic human rights of the citizens.

&gt;* This time, too, the provisions of the GPISA make arrest on 'suspicion' a cognisable and non-bailable offence, with the police and administration enjoying immunity from facing claims of damages even if the citizen is honourably acquitted after a trial.

272,"#Cauvery water row: Defiant CM defers release of water to TN till Friday

___

[IMAGE 1](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-54455417,width-400,resizemode-4/54455417.jpg)

BENGALURU:Chief minister Siddaramaiah+on Wednesday decided to convene a one-day legislature session on Friday to seek the opinion of elected representatives on the Supreme Court's order to release 6,000 cusecs ofCauvery+water per day to Tamil Nadu. He has deferred implementation of the order until such time.



The move - which virtually amounts to defying the apex court - will give some reprieve to the Congress government, under fire from agitating farmers inMandya+andMysuru+. The CM is likely to take the stand that just as the judiciary is of utmost important to him, so is the legislature. The legislature's unanimous resolution against releasing water will be submitted to the apex court.



The decision came afterSiddaramaiah+held day-long talks with his cabinet colleagues, JD(S) leaders and the legal fraternity. Speaking to reporters after a late-evening cabinet meeting, Siddaramaiah said the opinion at the all-party meeting was to immediately convene a legislature session to discuss the issue.



A big push for the government's position came from former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, who attended an all-party meeting that the BJP boycotted. Gowda was vociferous that the government cannot release water at the cost of farmers' interests.



BJP sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked Union water resources minister Uma Bharati to convene a meeting of all Cauvery basin states.



Karnataka counsel Fali S Nariman was of the view that the state should release water and express its difficulty before the court on September 27, the date of the next hearing.



It is learnt the Karnataka government took a cue from the Haryana-Punjab row over the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal. In May , the Punjab assembly had passed a resolution against the SYL Canal saying the state did not have water to share with Haryana.The latter, in turn, accused Punjab of ""crossing all limits"" and decided to approach the Centre and the Supreme Court. Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal moved a resolution in the assembly saying his state did not have even one drop to share with other states. The Karnataka leg islature's unani mous resolution will cushion the state government to some extent against contempt of court, sources said, as the issue would become one between the legislature and the judiciary. With assembly polls one and a half years away, the Congress government cannot afford to take the Supreme Court head on.



At a meeting of the council of ministers earlier in the day, the majority opinion was against releasing water. Some ministers are said to have pointed out that Karnataka had expected some relief from the court on Tuesday .



As all pleas by the state were turned down, there is a possibility of the state being asked to continue releasing water and make good the deficit in the next hearing on September 27. Therefore, it is necessary for the state gov ernment to adopt a hard position now, they felt.



At the all-party meeting, M Veerappa Moily , MP, exhorted the government to not release water, saying the apex court has no jurisdiction over the issue. A delegation led by Siddaramaiah is planning to call on President Pranab Mukherjee to apprise him of the situation and request him to direct PM Narendra Modi to call a meeting of the CMs of the Cauvery basin states.



""We are committed to protecting the interests of our farmers and meet the drinking water needs of Mysuru, Bengaluru and other cities. So we want to seek the opinion of all legislators,"" a senior minister said.



The BJP welcomed the cabinet decision to defer the decision to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu till they discuss the issue at the emergency session of the legislature. ""It's a belated decison but we welcome it. The two decisions taken at the late night cabinet meeting - to defer the decision to release water and convene an emergency legislature session -are the demands the BJP had been making for a long time in the shortterm and long-term interest of the people,"" BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa said.



The minister, however, said the legal team will continue its fight by seeking modification of the top court's order to release 6,000 cusecs.



Commenting on the state's hard stance, a legal expert said: ""The decision will harm Karnataka's interests during future hearings in court as it would be regarded a rogue state. There could be a constitutional crisis if Tamil Nadu moves the apex court to enforce its order.""



In 2002, then chief minister SM Krishna was pulled up by the apex court when he defied its order to release water to Tamil Nadu. He apologized and released water later. S Bangarappa tried to defy the interim order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal by promulgating an ordinance that was struck down by the apex court. He released water as stipulated in the interim award.

273,"#The 12-Year-Old Who Stopped Our Car And Threw Stones At Us In Kashmir

___

  
 
  
  Our vehicle screeched to a halt. We were returning from Uri where 18 soldiers were killed in a terror attack a day before. Security forces deployed along the highway were pulling back for the day.



 
From the front seat of the car, I could only see the top of a head.  A boy, no older than 12, had forced our vehicle to stop. With him was a group of another dozen, all in the same age group - 12 to 14 years old.

 
 

 
These are the ""stone-pelters"" of Kashmir, mostly minors, groups of  young boys who take over the streets and highways as the security forces withdraw each day.  

 
 

 
Our driver Ashiq, in his mid-fifties, apologised profusely to the boys for having broken an unofficial lock-down imposed by separatists in Kashmir. They were not listening and threw stones at our vehicle.  
  
  



Show Full Article

 
Sheikh Momin, our camera person, jumped out to reason with the group. Momin is local boy who has studied in Srinagar and now works with NDTV in New Delhi.



 
As he tried to talk to the boys, they zeroed in on a band he was wearing. ""Why the band on your hand, it is un-Islamic?"" a boy, about 12, said.

 
 

 
Momin, in his mid-20s and who wears faded jeans, loves apps on his phone and listens to pop music, was stumped. As he searched for an answer, the young boys said, ""You are a Hindu.""



 
And then, pointing to the camera slung across Momin's shoulder, another accusation - ""Indian media.""

 
 

 
A few adults watched from a distance as the boys conducted their inquisition. No one made an attempt to stop them.



 
Sensing trouble, Ashiq bowed and touched the feet of the 12-year-old to ask for forgiveness for having violated the lock-down orders issued by the Hurriyat and being enforced by its band of child soldiers.

 
 

 
He then had to listen to a long sermon and a heap of abuses from the boy, younger than his grandson. He did so quietly and was finally allowed to go after he promised never to violate the lock-down again.



 
Along the highway, an elderly man who keeps his small shop open on the sly, said ""I don't believe Burhan Wani's killing triggered this, something doesn't match.""

 
 

 
At night, slogans of ""Azaadi"" or freedom blare out from a mosque in the heart of capital Srinagar, where we are staying.

 
 

 
Over the last few months, it is groups of boys like the ones we met who have been holding the streets of Kashmir to ransom. Since July 8, when Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani was killed by security forces, the Valley has been on the boil. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has visited the Valley several times, even leading an all-party delegation. Mobile and internet services have been snapped many times and restored as many times.



 
New Delhi has pointed at Pakistan and there is strong proof. The National Investigative Agency or NIA is probing slush funds landing in the Valley and being used to prop up the protesters. But there are no clear answers to who and how these young boys are being organized and motivated.

Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal (Retd), Distinguished Fellow, Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, wrote in Rediff:“The army and the IAF should ‘hit to hurt’ the Pakistan army on the LoC where it is deployed in large numbers and can be easily reached. For every act of terrorism on Indian Territory for which there is credible evidence pointing to the involvement of the Pakistan army and the ISI, carefully calibrated military strikes must be launched against the Pakistan army. These should include artillery strikes with guns firing in the ‘pistol gun’ mode to destroy bunkers on forward posts with minimum collateral damage; stand-off PGM strikes on brigade and battalion HQ, communications centres, logistics infrastructure, ammunition dumps and key bridges; and raids by Special Forces and border action teams. Every Pakistan post through which infiltration takes place should be reduced to rubble by artillery fire.”

It would require Special Forces trained by the best. For this, I would choose Israel. We need commandoes that can strike valuable assets in the deep of the night and slip away.

288,"Firstly, I request you to do a little basic reading on the history of the dispute.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveri_River_water_dispute

&gt; He cites how Narasimha Rao solved the problem in 1995.

That was before the constitution of the Cauvery River Authority, Cauvery Monitoring Committee and the later Tribunal. The only way the two states could argue it out back then was via court or a direct meeting between the CMs. Also Rao's intervention forced Karnataka to release additional water for Tamil Nadu: You would not like this.

&gt;As for the decision not being overruled, that is the fucking job of the Parliament - to change laws. The judiciary can enforce them, yes, but the legislature and executive can change those laws. 

Let me get this straight. You want Modi to introduce a new bill in Parliament that dismisses all past bodies, tribunals, court judgements etc. in Cauvery and just lets Karnataka keep the water?

Not even looking at the many legal and political barriers there, the Supreme Court would just strike any such amendment down via judicial review. And the whole process would take years anyway.

&gt;This faulty line of thinking (primarily about precedent) is the problem with the tribunal award, why haven't recent changes been accommodated? 

Precedence is always considered in legal cases throughout the world, and generally water-sharing agreements throughout history in various countries have favoured the downstream regions. India has a water-sharing treaty with Pakistan over the Indus where we get only 20% of the water. 

Various committees and court panels have also studied new data in the past couple of decades and revised the agreement to give Karnataka some more percentage than in the past. All due procedures have always been followed and all data considered, including the current SC case.

&gt;Population has been growing all these years, the collected water will obviously not keep up pace with it.

In Tamil Nadu as well. The legal status is even if there is only 1000L of water left, Karnataka can keep no more than 37% or 370L.

&gt;And if you read the award statement, it states that 'more than 20% of the water should not be diverted' - is there a scientific basis for this number? What happens if there is a severe shortfall in rains, like in this year? Should this rigid constraint (since it is a percentage, it only gets worse) be enforced at the cost of drinking water needs? Has the huge population rise in the region been accounted for at all? So much for careful studies.

It's not about what it's being used for, it's about what percentage has been allocated to each state. Whether for drinking or samba crop, it's the respective states' choice on how to use the allocated water. Karnataka gets 37% of whatever is available, Kerala, TN and Puducherry get the rest. It's as simple as that.

Prior to this judgement the Supreme Court had studied all past tribunals and agreements. The two state governments had also sent their own teams with data on water usage and that too was considered. Do you really think this is a rash decision taken without proper consideration?
",2016-09-22 15:16:37
289,"&gt; Let me get this straight. You want Modi to introduce a new bill in Parliament that dismisses all past bodies, tribunals, court judgements etc. in Cauvery and just lets Karnataka keep the water?

Ugh. Where have I said that? Your contention was that the PM cannot do anything. That is plainly wrong.

&gt; All due procedures have always been followed and all data considered, including the current SC case.

Has it really? As far as I understand from it, giving more than 20% of Karnataka's share to Bangalore - which btw is 12-13% of the state's population - has been cited by the TN lawyers for their case. Now Bangalore does not have another large enough water source nearby to fulfill drinking requirements. Has this been considered at all? Just because the case is about sharing water from Cauvery doesn't mean decisions should be taken in a vacuum. 

&gt; It's not about what it's being used for, it's about what percentage has been allocated to each state. Whether for drinking or samba crop, it's the respective states' choice on how to use the allocated water. 

And that is plain dumb. If the tribunal award has failed to bring in checks for such critical situations, it needs to be changed. 

FWIW, I'm not saying no water sharing should take place at all, but there should be a contingency plan to keep drinking water needs above agricultural needs. I have no love lost for farmers from either state who relentlessly stick to water-guzzling crops like rice and sugarcane despite shortages.

Edit: 

&gt; Also Rao's intervention forced Karnataka to release additional water for Tamil Nadu: You would not like this.

Wut? So you're making judgements now on what I would or would not like? I was the one who mentioned it, obviously I've read it.",2016-09-22 15:40:05

&gt;* The report comes barely a month after prime minister Modi set up a task force to prepare a comprehensive action plan for Indian sportspersons, keeping the next three Olympic Games in mind.

&gt;* The gap has to be filled by hiring more number of national and international coaches per sport, per training centre and per location. The authority wants a well-defined and transparent selection criteria in place for this, based on talent, qualification, experience, and proven track record.

&gt;* Besides, it is recommended that a separate arm under the SAI be created which should be responsible for bidding and staging of major sporting events in India, the report said.

&gt; * However, as mentioned previously, the policy of misdirection involves disguising Indias growing internal strife under a mask of often exaggerated economic, political and military bravado to keep its internal populace pacified and further entrench its position in the hearts of the jingoistic Hindu nationalist camp.

&gt; * However, misdirecting attention away from problems does not make them go away, a fact that is becoming increasingly evident as noted scholars, scientists, filmmakers and other notable Indian thinkers are returning their state awards in protest against rising intolerance in India.

&gt; * Any communal violence in India has the potential of spilling over into neighboring countries as well, which is why India needs to take charge and own up to the communal tensions brewing inside its own borders.

  NEW DELHI: Highlighting the tourism potential of islands, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed speedy development of such places, 26 of which are proposed to be taken up for holistic improvement initially.  

 

  At a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister here, a presentation was given on the vision for holistic development, which involved inputs from the NITI Aayog, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and other senior officials.  

 

  India has a total of 1382 offshore islands, out of which officials have initially proposed 26 which could be considered for holistic development, a PMO statement said.  

 

  These 26 islands are located along different parts of India's coastline, including some in the Andamans and Lakshadweep, it added.  

 

  Officials, at the meeting held yesterday, informed the Prime Minister that developmental activities shall be centred around basic infrastructure, tourism, agriculture (including organic agriculture and fisheries), and carbon-neutral energy generation.  

 

  Emphasizing the strategic importance of India's island wealth, the Prime Minister stressed the potential for tourism in these areas, the statement said.  

 

  Urging the officials to speedily firm up plans for island development, Modi said solar energy should be used extensively in this exercise.

  NEW DELHI: India is negotiating with US Export-Import Bank for an $8-9 billion loan to finance six Westinghouse Electric nuclear reactors, two sources familiar with the talks said, although a lending freeze at the trade agency threatens progress.  

 

  The mega-project, the result of warming US-India ties in recent years, could open up billions of dollars of further investment in India's nuclear power sector, which was for decades shut out of the global market.  

 

  India now targets a ten-fold expansion in capacity to 63,000 MW by 2032, and US, French and Russian companies are among those chasing the business.  

 

  The Westinghouse deal, however, is contingent on financing and Ex-Im cannot approve loans of more than $10 million, owing to a row in the US Congress over board appointments stemming from a campaign by conservatives to close the government lender.  

 

  Only two of five seats on Ex-Im's board are filled and the appointment of a third director - the minimum needed to clear board decisions - is on hold due to opposition from the Senate Banking Committee Chairman, Republican Richard Shelby.  

 

  ""Financing of the reactors is the critical piece; everything is down to this,"" said one source involved in protracted negotiations to build the reactors in Andhra Pradesh.  

 

  The source, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, said Indian negotiators and Ex-Im officials were trying to set the terms of the financial package in the hope that the freeze on the bank, affecting potential sales of several major US companies, would lift soon.  

 

  Westinghouse is owned by Japan's Toshiba Corp but is based in the United States.  

 

  In addition to US Ex-Im, India is also seeking funding from Japan and South Korea for the reactors to be built in Kovvada, two sources familiar with the talks said.  

 

  Ex-Im had asked a South Korean export credit agency if it would be interested in partly financing the Westinghouse deal, since some of the nuclear equipment and materials are expected to come from South Korea, an official at the agency with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.  

 

  The agency was willing to fund a part if a Korean contractor was involved, with Ex-Im providing the majority of the total, the official said.  

 

  The US bank had not made any request to its Japanese counterpart to extend loans to the nuclear project in India, a source with direct knowledge said in Tokyo.  

 

 LEADERSHIP LOBBY 

  Both US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been promoting the nuclear deal, which was stuck for years because of an Indian law that made nuclear equipment suppliers liable in case of an accident, and not just the plant operators as is the global norm.  

 

  India has since set up an insurance pool to indemnify suppliers, and both Westinghouse and India's state-run operator Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) are working to a June 2017 deadline to sign the contract laid down by Obama and Modi.

  The deal with Westinghouse would be the first since a landmark 2008 US-India nuclear pact that allowed New Delhi access to foreign technology and finance even though it has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and runs an active weapons programme.  

 

  Under the rules of non-proliferation, no US or Japanese firm could engage in nuclear trade with a non-signatory, but since Washington made an exception for India, Tokyo has also signalled its assent.

320,"#Oracle likely to set up data centre in India: CEO Mark Hurd

___

[IMAGE 1](http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-54454121,width-310,resizemode-4,imglength-55662/oracle-likely-to-set-up-data-centre-in-india-ceo-mark-hurd.jpg)

___

 

  Mark Hurd    jointly runs $37-billion Oracle Corporation as a CEO along with Safra Catz. The company has had a presence in India for last 25 years and today has about 40,000 employees based in India alone. Hurd joined Oracle five years ago and was made CEO in 2014. Here he talks about the company's India strategy, its acquisition model as well as challenges of running a technology company. Edited excerpts:   

 

 Where does India lie on the map of global expansion for Oracle? 

 

  The growth rate in India is impressive. We have witnessed increasing success there and thus done many things to invest. There is a conglomeration of economies in that part of the world, bundled together to be called APAC, Asia Pacific Region. But the reality is there really is no APAC, they are a bunch of different economies that all have unique things. The economy in India is very much driven as a service economy, while China's economy has been very much a manufacturing economy. So, they are very different and if you ask what they have in common — the answer to it is — not all that much. We look at India as a very attractive market. We have had increasing levels of awareness about India, meaning that we have invested in events. Safra Catz, the Oracle joint CEO made a trip to India recently, and she came back so excited. That morning I remember she came to my office and was telling me the things we need to do in India and we are on that path.  

 

 What excites you about India? 

 

  The dynamics that excite us about any market is the scale of the market size. Yes, economy is important for us, and India's economy is only growing. India is on the path of modernisation of its infrastructure, and this usually has an effect on IT. So, as you get any type of scaled economy that is growing, that has modernisation opportunities and productivity opportunities, it becomes a very attractive market for a company such as Oracle. If you can supplement that with an educated country where there is availability of talent such as that is in India, it becomes very exciting.  

 

 The Prime Minister of India plans to take India on the digital route. Where does Oracle fit into this plan? 

 

  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been clear about digitisation, which we think ties in directly to the movement of cloud computing. We look at this as an opportunity. And it's there because of usage of old applications running on old infrastructure (common across the world). The cost of keeping that infrastructure and applications running is big. The opportunity to now move that to where it is done on somebody else's tab (expense) and still the innovation level goes up is what is exciting about the movement to cloud. Cloud is not just infrastructure as many people and at times media seems to reference. Cloud is applications, cloud is platform, cloud is infrastructure — all put together. And if you get a chance, as you move in to the cloud world, to get to an entire next generation of capabilities — it lends a big opportunity.  

 

 One of the challenges for a lot of Indian companies who want to adopt cloud computing, especially in the banking sector, is the regulation which requires data centres to be in the sovereign nation. Will Oracle start data centres in India to meet this requirement? 

 

  I think it is highly likely we will put a data centre in India. There are indeed compliance issues, regulatory issues which do not allow data to migrate out of the country or outside its firewall. But we have capability now, and it has been purchased by some customers in India, where we bring cloud to install on customer's premises. It would be like a subscription where customers need not buy but merely subscribe to our solution. Once done, we will install, manage, patch it and even secure it. So there are multiple ways, we will not just offer the solution of a public cloud in a data centre in India. We can actually take our cloud and put it in a data centre already present at the customers end.  

 

 Technology keeps changing, and disruption has caused many failures. Is there a plan B, if there is a cloud burst? 

 

  No, I don't think so. If we were to see a cloud burst — using your word, not mine — we would have seen it by now. We are the fastest growing cloud company in the world now. And let's look at the numbers around cloud companies, the big ones are probably at around $30 billion, total market is around $35 to $40 billion. Cloud business is growing at around 45% or probably faster. All of IT more or less is flattish and do I think that growth is about to slow down? No. It's opposite for us. Our growth rate is only getting higher. We have had seven consecutive quarters of a higher growth rate against a bigger base.  

 

  As CEOs begin to understand that I can spend less to get more, they will drive the technical community to cloud faster.  

 

 Oracle in the last decade has been buying a lot of companies for scale and technology. It is never easy to integrate companies and create a mega corp. How do you manage this transition and bring Oracle culture to all of them? 

 

  What Safra and I do on acquisitions is based on the following filters we use: a) We look for companies that fit strategically b) We try to do things that make financial sense, c) But we also try to buy companies that we can run. It does not make sense for us to buy something which is very expensive, fits in strategically, but we cannot run it. Not a good idea.  

 

  We don't (believe in) keeping places independent, do it your way, as if it's a democracy... No. It's not a democracy, we have a certain way we do these things, certain processes that we follow and we roll them right away.  

 

  We have two communities which we typically try to nurture within any acquired asset. It is the development community and the sales community. Those are the two organisational parts of any acquired asset that we are very interested in.  

 

  We do not have a common way we force on every deal, but we do have a Playbook. We make a judgement with each acquisition that we have made and then we go and execute it.  

 

 Oracle is run by two CEOs since last two years and that's a big test for both individuals. It has not been quite a successful model for many tech companies in the past who tried it, what does it take to run it smooth? 

 

  It isn't just Safra and me, there is also Larry Ellison (promoter and CTO at Oracle). We all talk a lot. And I tell you, this is the third company I have been CEO of and let me tell you these jobs are hard. We get guys like you that show up and slip in questions like ""Hey if you are so smart why don't you do this or that..."" The problem is that any of these big entities require lots of hands. If you can get experienced, capable hands, it is just a huge blessing. So I believe that the more people you can get to help you in these jobs, the better.  

 

  In the case of Larry, Safra and I, we do different things and we come from different backgrounds. Yet, we play interchangeable parts at the same time and it's exciting. We have been able to take the company through this transition which is fantastic.  

 

  At the core of it, you have to have people to get along. You have to have respect, you have to be willing to communicate and to share. If you don't have those values, it is always going to be hard. And that is not just unique to our situation but any executive team in any organisation.  

 

  Everyone needs to have a vision for what the size of the prize is if you want them to execute on the strategy.

330,"India scraps separate railway budget

---

&gt;* AFTER 92 years, India's cabinet decided on September 21 to abandon the British era legacy of annually presenting a separate railway budget in parliament.

&gt;* The decision has revived speculation that the government of prime minister Mr Narendra Modi intends to corporatise and restructure Indian Railways (IR) along commercial lines.

&gt;* Groaning under the weight of pending projects costing almost Rs 5000bn ($US 74.6bn), IRs financial targets this year have appeared shaky on account of the anticipated payout of Rs 400bn ($US 6bn) to meet the commitments of the 7th Pay Commission.

&gt;* IR's losses in the passenger segment are estimated to be as high as Rs 320bn.

&gt;* While it is unlikely that the Indian government will absorb IRs entire financial burden, the rail budgets merger with the general budget will ensure that IR will no longer need to pay the dividend against the Gross Budgetary Support component of the rail budget.

331,"* Despite electoral promises to be tough on Pakistan, the Hindu-nationalist government of Narendra Modi has trodden as softly as its predecessors.
* There are good reasons for this. India gains diplomatic stature by behaving more responsibly than Pakistan. It is keenly aware of the danger of nuclear escalation, and of the risks of brinkmanship to its economy. Also such is Pakistan's political frailty that any Indian belligerence tends to strengthen exactly the elements in it’s power structure that are most inimical to India’s own interests
* But there is another, less obvious reason for reticence. India is not as strong militarily as the numbers might suggest. 
* Much of its weaponry is, in fact, outdated or ill maintained. 
* On paper, India’s air force is the world’s fourth largest, with around 2,000 aircraft in service. But an internal report revealed that only 60% were typically fit to fly. A report by a government agency estimated that the “serviceability” of the 45 MiG 29K jets between 16% and 38%. They were intended to fly from the carrier currently under construction, which was ordered more than 15 years ago and was meant to have been launched in 2010. According to the government’s auditors the ship, after some 1,150 modifications, now looks unlikely to sail before 2023.
* India’s army has been seeking a new standard assault rifle since 1982.
* India’s military is also scandal-prone. Corruption has been a problem in the past, and observers rightly wonder how guerrillas manage to penetrate heavily guarded bases repeatedly. 
* The deeper problem with India’s military is structural. The three services are each reasonably competent, say security experts; the trouble is that they function as separate fiefdoms.",2016-09-23 18:29:17

&gt;* Cultural issues and saffronisation have resulted in a slow growth in Indias economic sector instead of big bang reforms, according to a top US think-tank, which said the NDA government has not yet fulfilled the expectation of moving towards a new India.

&gt;* The Washington-based Hudson Institute said though India has managed to combat inflation, it still has the potential to hit double-digit growth rates if it focuses on modernising infrastructure, improving basic amenities and reducing red-tapism.

&gt;* Indias economy can grow at double-digit rates if it can repair and rebuild its British era rail, road and air transport and port infrastructure, improve accessibility to basic amenities like electricity and water and untangle the Gordian knot of its complicated bureaucratic rules and regulations, it said yesterday.

&gt;* India has managed to combat inflation and the fall in global oil prices has reduced its subsidy burden on account of petroleum products, she said.

&gt;* It has become easier to start a business in India under the NDA government though access to credit has become tougher and paying taxes has become less easy, the report said.

339,"&gt; Despite electoral promises to be tough on Pakistan, the Hindu-nationalist government of Narendra Modi has trodden as softly as its predecessors.

That's because it is a very delicate situation, and no amount of rhetoric can change that. Every opposition party likes to spew the same nonsense about ""revenge"", ""eye for an eye"", and it seems to work like a charm for them. Personally, I'm glad that no government has been stupid enough to follow through on their pre-election bullshit. 

A war with Pakistan will destroy our nation, even without nukes. Our economy won't be able to handle it, not to mention our inability to replace officers, ammunition and equipment. The last major mobilisation left more than a thousand soldiers dead without even a shot fired, and cost billions. And for what?

---

&gt; * At the end of a week when India has been agonising to little effect about how to deal with a deadly attack on an army camp near the Pakistan border in Kashmir that should never have been allowed to happen, the government has today signed a $8.66bn deal with Rafale of France for 36 fighter jets that will do little to boost the under-equipped Indian Air Forces lack of readiness.

&gt; * In 2012, India decided to order 126 Rafale jets from Dassault of France, but negotiations became deadlocked, and Modi suddenly substituted an order for just 36 of the planes in fly-away condition when he was on an official visit to Paris in April 2014.

&gt; * That was seen at the time as an astute move by Modi, cutting through the red tape and ordering the urgently-needed jets for quick delivery, even though this would underline his Make in India manufacturing campaign.

&gt; * Indias defence orders are awash with corruption allegations and, significantly, Shukla notes that Indian MoD officials, fearing graft allegations over deals, draw some comfort in US deals because of the countrys foreign corrupt practices legislation.

___





  Very soon, teams of veterinary doctors will scout for a desi elite cow breed named Gangatiri in the villages of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Their mission: to purchase 100 such cows, as part of a cow conservation project launched by the Union agriculture ministry last year in Varanasi's Shahnshahpur village. Housed in a state government dairy farm established way back in 1950, the Gangatiri Cows' Conservation and Development Center has added new infrastructure — a water tank, a veterinary dispensary and a huge cowshed to accommodate the 100 purebred Gangatiri cows.  



 



  ""The purchase committee has already been formed. The fund is ready. But the challenge is to spot pure Gangatiri cows (as against crossbreeds). Our doctors will look for the cows in the villages of Varanasi, Allahabad, Ghazipur and Balia,"" says farm manager Sarvjeet Singh. He goes on to share the characteristics of this desi breed, its cost, milk yields and fat content, and why there is an urgent need to conserve this rare strain found in the eastern belt of UP.  



 



 All Roads Lead to Varanasi 



  Welcome to Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi since May 2014. Thanks to its VVIP nature, the constituency has succeeded in wooing Central ministry projects of varied size and scale — from cow conservation of the ministry of agriculture to the building of a multi-modal terminal for cargo ships under the ministry of shipping; from laying underground cabling in the temple and ghat areas under the Union power ministry's mega project to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) picking up a 2003 state government road project with a fresh deadline of May 2017, two years ahead of the next Lok Sabha poll.  



 



  The list of projects driven from Delhi is long. The ministry of textiles, for example, has begun work on a five-storey (13,799 sq m) office complex that will eventually turn into a one-stop shop for all textile stakeholders — weavers, exporters and marketing agencies.  



 



  Then, the ministry of tourism in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Authority of India, an agency under the ministry of shipping, has facilitated a luxury cruise service up to the city of Varanasi (starting from Patna). Even the ministry of railways is well on track in doling out projects for the PM's constituency.  



 



  Apart from undertaking a 25% expansion of the existing diesel locomotive works at Varanasi at a cost of Rs 266 crore, Indian Railways last year set up what it calls the Malaviya Chair in IIT-BHU, in memory of the institute's founder and Bharat Ratna Madan Mohan Malaviya. The objective is to research on and develop new materials for railway wheels, bushings, exhaust fans and the like with better longevity. The project costs, however, vary from one ministry to another. In terms of size, the ministry of road transport and highways is by far the topper. Nitin Gadkari's ministry is executing seven road projects connecting Varanasi, the total project cost being Rs 7,100 crore. Piyush Goyal's ministry of power has earmarked Rs 572 crore for Varanasi alone (out of Rs 1,067 crore for Uttar Pradesh) under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). The Central fund under this scheme is being used for underground cabling in areas around the temples and ghats, to upgrade the electrical assets at sub-centres, lines and distribution transformers, and to also install roof-top solar panels in government buildings in the city.  



  



 



 Centre vs State 



  Early this week, this writer visited six such project sites in Varanasi to get a first-hand account of the physical progress, bottlenecks and coordination issues that usually crop up between BJP's Central government and Samajwadi Party-run Uttar Pradesh sarkar. There are instances where the Centre has taken over state projects to expedite them and make the PM's constituents feel the difference on the ground well before it is time for a fresh electoral mandate in 2019. No senior state government officials came on record on the coordination gaps between the state and the Centre, but ground reports suggest there are pockets where all is not well.  



 



  For example, work is at a standstill at the NHAI-managed Varanasi bypass (ring road) project (phase I ) when this writer reaches the site. The fund, of Rs 261 crore, is ready. The deadline is May 2017. The physical progress, as provided by Varanasi's District Magistrate office, as of August 31, is just 26%. Where's the problem? ""The farmers stalled work, demanding better land compensation. There are some legacy issues too. Earlier, this was a state government project and some farmers were left out (from getting compensation). The issue is almost sorted now and the work will commence soon,"" says an official connected with the project, requesting anonymity.  



 



  Another roadblock to several projects is a 7-km-long tortoise sanctuary in the Ganga from Ramnagar Fort to Malviya Bridge in Varanasi. The Wild Life (Conservation) Act 1972 restricts the movement of vessels there, which puts a question mark on the very existence of the National Waterway No. 1, west of Varanasi. Cargo vessels are not allowed to move between Varanasi and Allahabad as they will have to pass through the tortoise sanctuary. Nor can big cruise ships move beyond Malviya Bridge, which puts paid to the prospect of extending the cruise till Allahabad, a popular religious spot north-west of Varanasi. Even the cleaning of the Ganga with the help of big vessels was objected to by the sanctuary authority, which comes under the forest department of the UP government.  



 



  The officers concerned are tight-lipped about the strategies being adopted to bypass the tortoise sanctuary. ET Magazine has learnt that a proposal of partial de-notification of the sanctuary, which has been operational since 1989, has moved from the state to the Centre, a piecemeal solution that may address some bottlenecks.  



 



  The people in Varanasi are hopeful that they will see a new city in the years to come. They have heard about Varanasi's pact with the Japanese city Kyoto, under which projects on solid-liquid waste management and transport management, have been undertaken. But, for the city administration, the efforts are as much for its 1.2 million citizens as for the 5.5 million tourists that arrive in this holy city every year.  



 



  ""Varanasi can't be developed with skyscrapers. It must retain its ethnic characteristics as tourists come here for spiritual experiences. What we have been doing here is to improve its amenities"" says Nitin Ramesh Gokarn, Varanasi's divisional commissioner, emphasising that there is no coordination issue between the state and the Centre as far as execution of development projects is concerned.  



 



  In additional to rolling out big-ticket projects, the Central ministries need to take care of the grievances of the PM's constituents. As the people of Varanasi can't meet their MP, who is also the country's prime minister, many of them land up at the PM's Jansampark Karyalaya (public relations office) in Varanasi's Ravindra Puri area and narrate their problems to the off i c e i n - c h a r ge Shivcharan Pathak, a man with RSS background. They expect Pathak to call up the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and solve their problems immediately. The expectations are natural. As many as 5,81,022 people (about 56% of the total votes cast) voted for the man who became prime minister.  



 



 Mini PMO 



  This writer meets a few complainants at Varanasi's ""mini-PMO"". And their problems range from getting a gas connection and a railway ticket confirmed to relatively complicated ones such as police atrocities and land encroachment.  



 



  Pathak, of course, does not need to call up the PMO to address most of these woes. If it is a problem pertaining to gas connection, he calls up a nodal officer in the Union petroleum ministry, and if the problem is a state subject, he forwards it to the district magistrate or divisional commissioner, and then follows it up over the phone. For their part, a bunch of Central ministers visit the office, and spend time there to hear out the complainants. ""On the first Saturday of every month, Mahesh Sharmaji (MoS for culture, tourism and civil aviation) meets people in this office. On second Saturdays, Manoj Sinhaji (MoS, telecom and railways) comes here. When Central ministers come, the number of people increases and many of them have to stand outside,"" says Pathak.  



 



  Congress MLA Ajay Rai, who came third in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in Varanasi (Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was second), says the PM's office in Varanasi is at best like a ""post office"". ""People come and lodge their complaints there. The question is how many of them get results? And once it became the PM's constituency, the local BJP MLAs have stopped working altogether. They now wait for the PMO to act,"" says Rai.

TN will keep crying about failed crops; but given how AAIDMK has no pan-India influence and how no other national party has influence in TN - nobody cares (and Jayalalitha will anyways give her support to NDA-3/UPA-3 based on how the wind is blowing then)

KA will not release much water. Irrespective of those who think that Siddhu will be forced by SC to release water, no they cannot do it. SC talks about invoking army and god knows what but they will not do it. It will set a very very bad precedent. SC does not have the masses support to stomach any of that. IF KA releases water, he will lose Mandya/BLR votes in 2018. 

BJP(Central Govt.) is just going to chill out and relax. They have nothing to gain by interfering, but will lose out if they do something. Assuming SC recommends govt. dismissal, I doubt Modi is so stupid to actually do it. Immediate re-elections will backfire on BJP for sure and whatever chance BJP might have had to come back in 2018 will go for a toss till 2021.

Siddhu is going to do nothing, maybe under lot of pressure release 1000 cusecs or something like that. Modi is going to do nothing, saying that the matter is in the Supreme courts. He cannot piss off Jayalalitha and he doesn't really get anything for solving this problem (even if he can, which I don't think so) for Siddhu. Siddhu will just take all credit for it. 

So, in short a Mexican Standoff (at least I think so). Things will continue. People will agitate, and then they will go back to earning their livelihood. YEs. Even all those pro-kannadiga protestors you see, don't get paid full time by their political parties to carry on this shit for weeks/months. 

And actually I am OK with the whole thing. Let the problem boil, when economies of both states start suffering - maybe at least maybe they will do something about rain water harvesting. or something better on water management.

Kozhikode: PM Modi at BJP meet in Kerala, addressed the people of Pakistan directly, accusing their leaders of exporting global terrorism. Delivering a strong message to the nation, PM said India will never forget the Uri attack and that the sacrifice of our 18 soldiers will not go in vain.  
  
  



Show Full Article

Here are the highlights from his first speech since the Uri attack:



 
PM Modi on Pakistan:Today I am speaking to the people Pakistan directly.From the leaders who read speeches written by terrorists, the world can expect nothing. But I want to speak to the people of Pakistan directly.I want to remind Pakistan, before 1947, your ancestors used to consider undivided India their land, worshipped it. And in their memory I want to tell you something.The people of Pakistan please ask your leaders, you have PoK. You cannot manage it.Bangladesh used to be yours, you couldn't manage it. You cannot manage Gilgit, Baltistan, Pakhtun, Balochistan, Sindh...and you are talking about Kashmir.People of Pakistan must ask their leaders to first give secure lives to their citizens.People of Pakistan ask your leaders, Both our countries got freedom together. Why does India export software and your country export terrorists?I want to tell the people of Pakistan to confuse you, your leaders have worked for ages. I am ready to face that challenge.I want to tell the people, If you have what it takes, lets compete to end poverty in our countries.Lets see who gets there first. People of Pakistan and India will like this competition.Youth of Pakistan, come lets fight. Lets see who ends unemployment first - India or Pakistan.Lets fight against illiteracy. Newborns, pregnant mothers die in both India and Pakistan. Lets see who can save them first.And leaders of Pakistan hear this. The sacrifice of 18 of our soldiers will not go in vain.India has succeeded in isolating you in the world. We will ramp it up and force you live alone in the world.That day is not far when people of Pakistan will get in the fray to fight against their leaders and terrorists.My dear countrymen, the future of our nation is connected to peace and good thoughts.Our country wins when we stand together, say in one voice, have one resolution.Today 1.25 billion Indians are ready to pay any price for our pride and peace. That's why I see a glorious future for India.My dear countrymen, on Deen Dayal Upadhyay's birth anniversary we have decided to re-dedicate ourselves to work for the poor.In the 21st century, our goal should be that India should be free from poverty, full of prosperity.India should aim to be- Free from injustice, land of justice, Free from filth, land of cleanliness, free from corruption, land of transparency, free from unemployment, land of employment.India should be- Free from crimes against women, land of dignity for women, free from disappointment, land of hope.On Deen Dayal Upadhyay's birth anniversary let these be our guiding goals.

PM Modi on terrorism:We've been hearing it for a while - 21st century is Asia's century. And Asia has all it takes to achieve that.But there is one country in Asia that is working towards thwarting that vision.It is doing all it can to ensure Asia is bloodied, it is bruised by violence, falls prey to terror.Wherever terrorism is happening in Asia, the blame is on one country.Not just India, every country in Asia believes this. One country is exporting terror everywhere.Afghanistan, Bangladesh, all neighbouring countries and in the world, wherever a terror attack takes place.It emerges either the terrorist set out from here, or after the attack, like Osama Bin Laden, took refuge here.Brothers and sisters, people of Kerala know what terrorism looks like.Kerala's daughters, nurses, were taken away by terrorists. Entire India was tensed.But entire Kerala saw, how the government in Delhi returned the daughters of Kerala to their homes.Terrorism is enemy of humanity. Humanitarians all over the world have to unite and condemn terror.India never has and never will bow down to terror, it will defeat terror.The entire country is seeing the effects of terror.In Jammu and Kashmir's Uri, 18 soldiers had to sacrifice their lives.Let terrorists hear this, India will never forget this.In the last few months, 17 times terrorists in groups of 4 or 6 have tried crossing over the border to spread destruction.But our brave soldiers thwarted those efforts, they slayed them on the LoC.In the last few months, our soldiers have killed 110 terrorists - the highest in recent years.Saving the countries from these 17 possible attacks was done by our soldiers, they stood guard and secured our citizens, we are proud of their service, their sacrifice.You can imagine, the neighbouring country succeeded in one attack and 17 soldiers had to fall prey.If they had succeeded in all 17 incidents what would have happened.Our soldiers, our police, all our security forces have won these battles not just because of the weapons. Weapons are toys.Soldiers win on confidence, and India's confidence is flying at its highest. This is our strength.Leaders of the neighbouring country said will fight 1,000 years, where did they disappear, we cant see them anymore.And today's leaders, they read speeches written by terrorists and singing about Kashmir.

PM Modi on BJP Ideology:In the last century, India's political life was influenced by three people, Mahatma Gandhi, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Ram Manohar Lohia.When elected members of the NDA chose me as their leader and when I gave the first speech on the floor of the Parliament, I had said this government is dedicated to the poor.This comes from the thinking of Mahatma Gandhi and Deen Dayal Upadhyay. Our directive is based on their ideology.And I want to assure BJP workers of Kerala, the service you have given, the injustices you have endured, the sacrifices you have made will not go in vain.They will bear fruit and the BJP will herald progress in Kerala.Kerala has all the capability to become India's top state.The BJP and the Indian government will be ready to all it takes to make this happen.India is moving forward with one mantra- Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.The whole world recognises India to be the world's fastest growing major economy.Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelated'India Will Never Forget Uri,' Says PM Modi In Kerala: Top 10 QuotesMore Stories5 Dead In Shooting At A Mall In Burlington, Washington; Suspect At LargePraise For Indian Diplomat Who Rebuffed Nawaz Sharif At UN'Let's Fight Battle Against Poverty, See Who Wins,' PM's Strong Message To Pakistan

Kozhikode, Kerala:  
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was directly addressing the people of Pakistan as he sent across a strong message against the ""export of terrorism"" from that country, vowing that ""India will never forget the Uri attack.""



In his first public speech since four terrorists sneaked into an army camp in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri and killed 18 soldiers, PM Modi said, ""People of Pakistan, we are ready to fight you. Show courage and let's fight poverty and see who eradicates poverty faster. Who wins the fight against unemployment first.""



But he also warned, ""The sacrifice of our 18 soldiers will not be forgotten. We will ensure that the international community works to isolate you.""



India, the Prime Minister said, would not bow to terror. ""110 terrorists have been killed by the Indian Army... terrorists have tried to strike 17 times recently, they were successful in one incident,"" he said.



The two nations, the PM said, got Independence together, but ""India exports software, you export terror"". There was little the world expected from Pakistan's leaders, who ""read speeches written by terrorists,"" said PM Modi, who was addressing party workers at a BJP meet in Kerala's Kozhikode.



Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has alleged that India has hastily blamed it for the Uri attack without investigation. But investigators have found that the weapons and food recovered from the four dead terrorists in Uri had Pakistani markings.



Relations between the two countries have plummeted since unrest began in Kashmir following the death of terrorist Burhan Wani in July. India has accused Pakistan of instigating and fuelling violent clashes that have killed 87 people and left over 10,000 injured.



A political resolution expected to be adopted at the BJP meet that the PM is attending, is likely to include the situation in Kashmir and the Uri attack.

&gt; To Indian policy makers this may look like a clever balancing act but, coming on top of the UPA government’s gradual distancing of India from its old allies, such as Russia and secular nations in the Arab world, in favour of the US, the gulf sheikhdoms and Israel, it is giving the rest of the world the impression that India does not understand where its long term national interest lies, and is therefore a country that no one can rely upon.

“Hindus are cowards and Muslims bullies,” the Mahatma Gandhi once famously said. And this seems to be fairly true: today at the least sign of trouble, Hindus stay home, shy from confrontation, or outright run away. We indeed witnessed how the 4,00,000 Hindus of Kashmir, who had done no crime, except being Hindus, fled the Valley of Kashmir under terror, without firing a single shot in self-defence, losing all their ancestral homes and lands and becoming refugees in their own country.

In Assam, where the same situation arises, it is the Christian Bodos who take up arms, not the Hindus. How is that possible, when Hindus are still nearly 80 % of India and have their own government that of the BJP, in power at the Centre?

Among the causes that have been spoken off, we find Buddhism‘s uncompromising stance on non-violence, which seems to have blunted the Kshatriyas spirit of the Hindus. But that cannot be the total explanation, as Buddhism was wiped out of from India by the successive Muslim invasions, whereas Hinduism survived. Various historians have also pointed out that the biggest genocide in the history of humanity must be that of the Hindus: from the time of the Hindu Kush (which means the killing of Hindus), when Muhammad Ghori, after having defeated Prithviraj Chauhan, took away in winter 5,00,000 slaves to Afghanistan, the majority of whom died of cold in the Kyber pass, to Timur, who killed one hundred thousand Hindus in one day. It has been calculated that 100 millions Hindus died directly or undirected because of invasions. This has left a scar of terror in the Hindu collective unconscious, that can be observed even today, as Hindus panic so easily, and are the most undisciplined community in the word, cheating, breaking queues and always trying to bypass the laws.

From great innovators, they became brilliant copiers and the English also fashioned an Indian intellectual class, surviving till today, which looks at India through British eyes, that is negatively, often with contempt and misunderstanding.

Indeed, though most history books credit the Mahatma with the freedom of India, it is early revolutionaries, such as Sri Aurobindo or Gangadhar Tilak , who believed in the re-igniting of Hindu power and the booting out the British, by force if necessary, who where its true initiators. Guilty too, the first Prime Minister of India, Nehru, who thought that his country did not need a powerful army, which led to the disastrous defeat against the Chinese in 1962. He also compromised on Kashmir, when the Indian soldiers had the upper hand, and went instead to the UN, thus, legating the problem that is flaring up today in Uri and elsewhere in the Valley. It is this combination of Buddhism, Gandhism, colonisation, Nehruvianism and trauma of invasions, which have eroded, not only Hindu power, but also the capability of Hindus to hold power and wield it efficiently when they have it.

Compassion can only be exercised when you are strong and ready. Yet, it is not that there is no precedent to learn from: a thousand years ago, Mohamed Ghori rewarded Prithivaj Chahan’s generosity in letting him go free, when he lost the first battle of Tarain, by attacking Chauhan treacherously a year later, blinding him and ultimately executing him.

NEW DELHI: Likening the anger in the country overUri attack+to that witnessed in the 1965 war,Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday+maintained that those responsible for the terror strike will surely be punished as he asserted that the army does not speak but displays bravery.



He also sent out a message to the people of Kashmir, which has been witnessing unrest for over two months, saying that ""peace, unity and harmony"" are the ways to resolve problems and expressed confidence that all issues can be addressed through discussions.



In hismonthly radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat'+which he began by paying tributes to the 18 soldiers who died in the Uri attack on September 18, Modi said, ""this cowardly act was enough to shake the entire country. There is mourning as well as anger in the country.""



He said, ""This is a loss not only for those families which lost their sons, brothers, husbands. This loss is for the entire country. That is why, today I will say only this much, which I said on that day (of the incident) also and I will repeat it today, that theguilty will surely be punished+.""



Reposing faith in theIndian Army, the Prime Minister said it will foil all such designs through its bravery.



""They (Indian armymen) are the people who take bravery to its pinnacle so that 125 crore people can live a peaceful life,"" he said.



""We are proud of our army. People and politicians get opportunities to speak and that's what they do. But the army does not speak. The army displays its bravery,"" Modi said.



He read out a message of an 11th standard student who had expressed anger over the Uri incident and had the desire to do something over it. After lot of thinking, he had resolved to give extra 3 hours to studies every day as his contribution to the country.



Appreciating the child's ""constructive thinking"", the Prime Minister said, ""there is a lot of value to the anger that people of the country have. This is a symbol of the country's awakening. This anger is of the kind of 'do something'... When 1965 war (with Pakistan) broke out and Lal Bahadur Shastri was leading the country, similar was the feeling, anger in the country. There was fever of nationalism. Everybody was keen to do something.



""At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji attempted to represent this feeling in an excellent manner to the world and he gave the slogan of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' to inspire common people to work for the country.""

441,"Does anyone know that this guy has Parkinsons? I used to always suspect it as a doctor, but read the book by Sanjay Baru and it confirmed my diagnosis. I know everyone made fun of him because of his lack of expressions while giving speeches, his robotic body language and rigid arm movements-check him waving to a crowd. These are classic signs of parkinsons-infact in medicine we call it mask like facies-for someone who is expressionless. 
    Despite this, and the fact he's has had a major bypass-I respect this man. As for the corruption scandals, we really don't know what he was thinking. He could've taken a moral position and resigned. Perhaps he thought that people would understand that the figure taken out by CAG for the 2g scam was a presumptive loss that ranged from a few million to multi billions loss-based on a policy decision on whether to auction or not to auction spectrum or coal. Media took the sexiest figure and pilloried this guy. 
     I can only say history will definitely be kind to this man...especially after the Jumle-baazis of this present govt. He worked under in a very un-ideal situation for anyone-lack of support from his own partymen. Pranab Mukerjee and Arjun Singh bypassed his authority regularly and would go to 10 Janpath instead. And lets not forget that schizophrenic coalition partners like Mamata that would threaten to stop support for sensible decisions on reforms like subsidy deregulation and railway price increase, made his decision making capacity very limited. 
      Perhaps he felt it's better to manage the known mess and hope it improves than have mid-term elections in the storm of regular protests and decimate the congress (which happened inevitably). But I think, we can only compare him with the distance of history-another 20 years. Just the attack in Uri tells us, that in the opposition like Modi previously, one has the liberty to talk and mock. But only in power, one realises the limits to power. BJP mocked the AADHAR and threatened to abolish it when it came to power-now it wants it to become mandatory in schools! They mocked RTE-not a step's been taken to remove it. Even the MNREGA...the list is endless.
     Broadly, the Modi govt is still following the same steps as Congress in pretty much all spheres (-gau raksha gangs/-pseudonational/pseudosecular debates), so I can only say that unless he radically is able to do something (like privatise Air India/Ashoka hotel for starters), atleast MMS's economic policies will be remebered by historians as favorable IMO",2016-09-25 16:35:05

  Forty-six years and one day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the Swachh Bharat Mission on October 2, 2014 — the 145th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi — Lee Kuan Yew had done something similar in Singapore. On October 1, 1968, a little over three years after Singapore became an independent republic, prime minister Lee launched the government's first nationwide public education programme, dubbed The Keep Singapore Clean Campaign. The aim of the month-long mission: to make Singapore the cleanest and greenest city in the region by tackling its bane of littering in public places. A month, of course, is hardly enough for large-scale change of any kind. Not even a year. Nor a decade. To be sure, the initial success emboldened Singapore to follow up with a series of campaigns over the decades — from Use Your Hands and Keep the Toilets Clean to a Clean and Green Week in the 1990s.  

 

  In 2018, a year before the Swachh Bharat Mission hopes to eradicate open defecation — 2019 is also the year of General Election — it would be 50 years of The Keep Singapore Clean Campaign. As of today, close to five decades of sustained efforts, including stiff penalties and strict enforcement, public education and community engagement, have gone a long way in helping Singapore battle the scourge of litter — a war that it, however, still can't claim to have won as it still deals with cigarette butts, used tissue, food and drink containers and assorted packaging. But if Singapore is today known for its by and large clean environment, the initial efforts of Lee would have to be acknowledged.  

 

  

  

  

 

  Now Singapore can hardly be compared with India — it is roughly 4,700 times smaller, its population stands at under 6 million vis-a-vis India's 1.2 billion-plus, and a study by The Economist suggested that Singapore's GDP is most comparable to Maharashtra's. The similarity, though, is that Modi and India today may be where Lee and Singapore were in the late '60s (previous governments did kick off several cleanliness campaigns, but never perhaps with such intent, pomp and hype).  

 

  

 

  As the story on Sikkim's quest for cleanliness and happiness shows, success takes its time in coming, but it inevitably does come. As long as the strategy is right, along with execution and purpose. A beginning has been made, but the harder work comes now. A Swachh Bharat would also mean a country free of corrupt practices — which is perhaps an even bigger pipe dream than a litterfree India. Once toilets are built, it's time to get people to use them — and even more important to figure out ways to clean them without human intervention. Let's not forget what the Father of the (Swachh) Nation said: ""What is so distressing is that the living quarters of the menials and sweepers employed in the viceroy's house are extremely dirty.... I shall be satisfied only when the lodgings of the ministers' staff are as neat and tidy as their own."" Over to October 2.

446,"#'Kicked In My Stomach': Pregnant Dalit Woman Beaten For Not Picking Cow Carcass

Story Highlights
 Pregnant Dalit woman, family beaten up in Gujarat's Banaskantha district 
 They had refused to dispose a cow carcass, attacked by around 20 people 
 6 arrested, incident in series of violent crimes against DalitsBanaskantha, Gujarat: A 25-year-old pregnant Dalit woman and her family were beaten up in Gujarat on Friday allegedly after they refused to dispose of a cow carcass, police has said.



 
According to the family, a group of men from the upper caste Thakore community came to her house in the Mota Karga village about 180 km from Ahmedabad demanding that they pick up the carcass of a dead cow.



 
The family had left the work long ago and a boycott called by Dalit groups after the public flogging of four men from the community in the state two months ago had only hardened their resolve.

But upset at their defiance, the men left only to return with a larger group of about 20.



 
""Even before we could realise what was happening, they started abusing us and then started attacking us with wooden sticks,"" Sangita Ranavasiya told NDTV at a government hospital in neighbouring Palanpur.



 
""They kicked me in my stomach,"" she said. Five months pregnant, Sangita started bleeding.



 
After raining abuses and blows for half-an-hour, the group fled the scene, leaving six other members of her family, including her husband Nilesh, injured.



 
""We kept telling them we don't pick up carcasses, but they wouldn't listen. They kept reminding us that we are supposed to do the menial jobs,"" said Nilesh.



Six people were arrested after the family filed a complaint with the police. Doctors have said Sangita's baby is fine.



 
Gujarat has been stirred by protests in recent months after four Dalit men were beaten up in Una, in south Gujarat, by alleged cow protectors in July.



 
Following the incident, the community pledged not to skin dead cows, an occupation thrust upon a section of Dalits.



 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also joined the clamour against violence in the name of cow protection last month by calling such attackers ""anti-social elements"".Comments &lt;div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Post your commentsRelatedPregnant Dalit Woman Beaten Allegedly For Not Disposing Cow Carcass, 6 ArrestedMore Stories'Don't Rebuke Muslims, Empower Them,' Says PM Modi At BJP Conclave: HighlightsStephen Hawking Doesn't Want Us To Contact Aliens.

&gt; * The Paris agreement was seen to be one of those things where India was part of the leadership that actually hammered out a deal, with Modi and Obama working the phones and working together to get there.

&gt; * By ratifying, Modi has indicated India would play a role in it, even though government recently denied a US statement on imminent ratification by India.In June, India hinted at linking its NSG membership with its ratification of the Paris agreement but had to walk back from it.

&gt; * ""Two weeks ago when China and US jointly announced they had ratified the Paris Agreement, it put the pressure back on India, specially, as climate negotiators observed, India was once again being blamed for being the problem, when it really is still China that is a problem.

&gt;* However, officials of the ministries of water resources and external affairs said they were not aware of such a meeting being convened by the PM, according to a PTI report.

&gt;* Under the treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan president Ayub Khan, the water of six rivers  Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum  is shared between the two countries.

&gt;* There is now a clamour to use the pact to bring the neighbour to mend its ways after the Uri attack proved Pakistan is both unable and unwilling to stop its territory from being used by terrorists against India.

&gt;* Making any precedent in which an upper riparian state is overbearing can give hints to Beijing on the water-sharing issue, which doesnt augur well for India.

NASHIK: The Jain community here has urged Prime MinisterNarendra Modito declareKshamapana Parva, one of the most significant days inJainism, as a day of national observance. On Saturday, the Jains celebrated the event in a grand way for the first time in the city and drafted 1,008 letters addressed to the PM in favour of their demand.



""Mahakshamapana was celebrated in Nashik in a big way. Leaders of various Jain sects came together on a platform to promote the message of Kshamapana - the act of apologising for any wrongdoing committed by us and forgiving others who may have hurt us. A collective appeal was made to PM Modi through 1,008 letters with a request to take steps towards declaring the day as international Kshamapana day,"" said Paras Jain, president of the Jain Navkar Youth group.



Kshamapana Parva is marked on the last day of the annual Paryusana Parva, which is observed in the Bhadrapada month of the Hindu calendar. Paryusana Parva ends with the practice of forgiving each other. This year, the day of forgiveness was observed on September 17.



""If we can have Mother's Day, Father's Day and Daughter's Day, what's wrong in following the rich tradition of Indian culture and adopt this day as the day of forgiveness?,"" Jain said.



On the day of Kshamapana, the Jains chant Prakrit phrase Micchami Dukkadam (may all my faults be dissolved) to seek forgiveness. They approach friends and relatives seeking forgiveness for mistakes done knowingly and unknowingly.



""In the current scenario, when hatred and revenge are the prevailing emotions in people, forgiveness is the most important thing we could instil in our nature. This is the only solution to violence, intolerance and jealousy. Just like the world accepted Yoga Day on India's initiative, we wantKshamayapna Diwasto be promoted on the same line,"" Jain monk Ratneshwar Surishwer Maharaj said.

&gt; * When the prawns he reared died of viral infection and he had to switch to Karimeen (pearl spot) farming nine years ago, A. Baburaj of Kadalundi never imagined that this delicate fish would turn his life around.

&gt; * Baburaj stays at Cheriyathuruthi, a small island almost at the mouth of the Kadalundi river, that houses 14 families.

&gt; * In fact, his is the only Karimeen seed farm in the region.

&gt; * In fact, he says the island provides the best possible condition for Karimeen farming with constant flow of water from the river to the pond, saving him the effort of artificially managing the oxygen-level in the pond.

ISRO today launched eight satellites from one rocket into two different orbits

Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh:   In its longest and most complex mission, India's space agency ISRO today launched eight satellites from one rocket into two different orbits. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, ""Our space scientists keep scripting history."" Here is your 10-point cheatsheet:

The PSLV or 37th Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, carrying three satellites from India, three from Algeria, and one each from Canada and the US, lifted off from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh at 9:12 am. Around noon, ISRO said its launch was ""100 per cent successful"".Most countries launch satellites in a single orbit and even if multiple satellites are injected, it is in a sequence in the same orbit.What makes this mission a challenge is that the PSLV will launch its payloads in two different orbits. The twin-orbit manoeuvre was recently accomplished by European Space Agency's Vega rocket.""This is a challenging two-in-one mission which puts India in a unique league of nations having the capability to achieve two different orbits in a single mission,"" Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman AS Kiran Kumar earlier told NDTV.India's SCATSAT, meant for ocean and weather forecasts, cyclone detection and tracking, has been placed in orbit. India shares such data with the US, which helped them track Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Pratham, a 10-kg satellite developed by students of the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, will study the total electron count in space. The 5.25-kg PISAT made by students of Bengaluru's PES University will take pictures of earth.The mission will also test PSLV's multiple burn capability which will be utilized in the last leg and will set a new milestone for ISRO. The whole procedure was completed within 2 hours and 15 minutes - the longest mission for ISRO.The stop-start of the rocket - while travelling at a speed of more than 2660 kmph - gives PSLV an edge in the multi-billion dollar commercial launch market. ""It will open up new vistas to commercialise ISRO's launch capabilities for two-orbit configurations,"" said Dr K Sivan, Director of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center.In another first later this year, India hopes to launch its heaviest rocket, the Geo-Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III, capable of taking up to 4 tonnes of communications satellite.The three Algerian satellites are for earth observation, remote sensing and technology demonstration. The US' Pathfinder-1 is a commercial high resolution imaging micro satellite while Canada's NLS-19 is a technology demonstration nano satellite for experimentation in helping to reduce space debris and for tracking commercial aircraft.

  NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government is considering a proposal to evict Congress from its headquarters on 24 Akbar Road and three other bungalows in Lutyens' Delhi, besides demanding market rent on these properties since June 2013.  

 

  The development comes nearly two years after the BJP-led government served a notice to Congress to vacate the bungalows since the lease had run out. 24 Akbar Road has housed the principal opposition party since 1976.  

 

  Congress was allotted land in June 2010 for building a party office on 9-A Rouse Avenue. As per the government policy on allotment of land to political parties, a party gets three years to build its office after allotment of land. Therefore, the party was required to vacate the four bungalows leased to it by June 2013.  

 

  The Directorate of Estates, under urban development ministry, is planning to send a fresh notice to Congress to recover the outstanding dues, senior officials privy to the matter told ET.  

 

  The directorate served a notice to Congress in this regard in January 2015, said one of the officials, who did not wish to be identified. Besides, the official said, the directorate has prepared an estimate on the outstanding dues for the bungalows including the ones on 26 Akbar Road, 5 Raisina Road and C-II/109 Chanakyapuri. While those on 24 and 26 Akbar Road are Type VIII bungalows, the other two are Type VI bungalows.  

 

  

 

  The difference between the subsidised monthly rent being paid and the market rate — ""damage charges"" in the directorate's parlance — is about Rs 2 lakh per month for a Type VIII bungalow and Rs 70,000 for a Type VI bungalow.  

 

  The rent paid by the party ranges between Rs 26,000 and Rs 77,000 per month for the four buildings while the market rate varies between Rs 67,000 and Rs 2.33 lakh per month plus garden charges.  

 

  When contacted, Congress treasurer Motilal Vora said, ""We have an extension of time to build our new party office till 2018. We are paying the rent which we are required to."" An urban development ministry official, however, refuted this claim. ""The claim is wrong. They had sought extension of three years subject to sanction of building plans. They were not granted an extension,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.  

 

  The Congress has already been served notice that it has exceeded the three-year period and that it has to pay market rent with interest, the official said. ""This issue still stands. The issue of eviction proceedings will be addressed by urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu,"" he said.  

 

  Director (estates) Anand Singh has moved the fresh proposal to secretary (urban development), officials said. The proposal suggests that the issue be sent to eviction branch for ""necessary process"", they said. ""It (eviction) is a political call. But the directorate will issue a fresh notice to Congress for payment. The final eviction is done through a process,"" an official said.

PM Modi will discuss with officials the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan

New Delhi:   India today ruled out cancelling the Indus Waters Treaty With Pakistan, but sources said in a new and aggressive move, New Delhi is planning on greater use of three of the five rivers that are controlled by Pakistan. Here are 10 facts on the story:

""Blood and water cannot flow together,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi was quoted as saying at a meeting with top officials this morning to assess the 50-year-old treaty with Pakistan days after the Uri terror attack.Sources said the government plans to exploit to the maximum the capacity of three of the rivers that are under Pakistan's control - Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.The treaty was signed in 1960 between India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan's president General Ayub Khan after World Bank brokered negotiations that lasted almost a decade.Control over the three eastern rivers - the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej - was given to India and the three western rivers - the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - went to Pakistan, unrestricted.India can use only 20 per cent of the water of the Indus, which flows through it first, for irrigation, transport and power generation.Sources say the capacity of exploiting the three eastern rivers is exhausted, so the government plans to explore the option that has not been utilized for 30 years - which is to use the western rivers.""The decision is to store water and maximize irrigation area. With this we would be able to irrigate land in Jammu and Kashmir for nearly six lakh hectares,"" said sources. The decision also addresses the sentiment of people of the state, who have said in the past that the treaty isn't fair to them.India has been debating whether it can afford to leverage the river agreement to tighten pressure on Pakistan after the Uri terror attack in which 18 soldiers were killed by Jaish e Mohammad terrorists. Officials say an assessment of the Indus treaty is bound to factor in China, where the river Indus originates. China also holds the controls of the river Brahmaputra.If India were to cut off supply to Pakistan, it could cause major crises in that country as a majority of its areas are dependent on Indus water.Stopping the flow of the Indus into Pakistan would cause floods in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Sources say the government wants three dams on the river Chenab to be speeded up.

  HYDERABAD: After wading through waist-deep water, Ajit Yadav returned to his workplace, a food processing unit at Cherlapally, after three days on Sunday. But upon unlocking the door, he found his workplace in ruins. Worse, he was out of job because his employer said it would take months to set things in order.  

 

  ""I have several mouths to feed but now with many units shut due to floods, I am at a loss,"" said Yadav, who migrated from Jharkhand looking for work.  

 

  Ajit's story is one of many , as over 35,000 daily-wage labourers have lost their livelihood with rains lashing the city recently , sources said. With over 10,000 small units along the low-lying industrial belt of Quthbullapur, Dulapally , Jeedimetla, Cherlapally, Kukatpally and Balanagar, completely ruined following the heavy rains, the fate of many daily wagers remains uncertain. Many units which were completely submerged and have been inaccessible so far, were opened over the weekend to sights of damaged machinery and raw material.  

 

  The damage has thrown life out of gear for workers, who hail from Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal.  

 

  ""On reaching our electric bulb manufacturing factory , I discovered that there was no possibility of work till the water recedes. Having survived on a hand-to-mouth situation, we have almost no savings. We are being told that the factories will not reopen for two months. It has been difficult to put food on the table for the last few days. How are we going to survive?"" asked Raghu, who hails from Khurda in Odisha.  

 

  ""Apart from many industries around Jeedimetla getting flooded, areas where our employees stay have also been badly affected. To add to problems, there are power cuts and connectivity issues to due bad roads,"" said Srirama Murthy , managing director, Scarlet Industries at Balanagar and member Jeedimetla industrial association.  

 

  Industries, including those focusing on engineering, steel, plastics, bulk drugs, and food processing. are among those worst hit. ""Two of our storage facilities in Dulapally and Jeedimetla have been submerged in five-feet deep dirty water for four to five days, completely damaging our stock. We have lost more than 300 tonnes of petro-chemical products (used by other industries). We are still unable to enter the units,"" said Manoj Duggad, managing director, Ayushman Merchants Pvt Ltd, manufacturers and suppliers of industrial chemicals. He estimated the loss to be between Rs 90 lakh and Rs 1 crore.  

 

  From having to re-do electrical connections, to losing out on orders, to buying new machinery , the industrial units that supply goods in Telangana as well as to AP , Karnataka and Maharashtra are going to take a while to recover. ""Loss is on many levels including with respect to material, worker payment, machinery and products. The loss would be easily over Rs 1,000 crore,"" said Ravindra Modi, president, Federation of Telangana and AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry , adding food processing and pharma units have sustained major losses.

NEW DELHI: ""Blood and water can't flow at the same time,"" Prime MinisterNarendra Modisaid on Monday during a meeting to review theIndus Water treaty+with Pakistan amidst heightened tension between the two countries.



Principal secretary to PM, Nripendra Misra, national security adviser Ajit Doval, foreign secretary S Jaishankar, the water resources secretary, and other senior officials were present in the meeting.



At the meeting, it was decided that India will exploit to the maximum the capacity of three Pak-controlled rivers — Indus, Chenab, Jhelum — as per the Indus Water Treaty.



India will also review the construction on Tulbul navigation project, which was suspended in 2007.



The review is being undertaken as India weighs options to give a befitting response to Pakistan in thewake of the Uri attack+that left 18 soldiers dead.



There have been consistent calls in India that the government should scrap the water distribution pact tomount pressure on Pakistan+in the aftermath of the terror attack.



Under the treaty, which was signed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan President Ayub Khan in September 1960, water of six river - Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - were to be shared between the two countries.



According to the agreement, India has control over three eastern rivers — Beas, Ravi and Sutlej — all flowing from Punjab.



Pakistan, as per the treaty, controls the western rivers — the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum that flow from Jammu and Kashmir.



External affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup had said last week that there were differences between India and Pakistan on implementing the Indus Waters Treaty.



Jammu and Kashmir deputy chief minister Nirmal Singh had also said last week that his state willfully support+whatever decision is taken by the Union government on the 1960 agreement.



""The treaty has caused huge loss to Jammu and Kashmir"" as the people of the state cannot fully utilise the waters of various rivers, particularly Chenab in Jammu, for agricultural and other activities, Singh had said.



""The state government will support whatever decision is taken by the central government on Indus Waters Treaty,"" he had said.

PM Modi will discuss with officials the 1960 Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan

New Delhi:   As New Delhi keeps up pressure on Pakistan over the Uri terror attack last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will today meet top officials for a briefing on the five decade-old Indus Water Treaty between the two countries. Here are 10 facts on the story:

PM Modi will meet officials from various ministries including external affairs and water resources. Sources say he wants to discuss the pros and cons of any action on the 1960 water treaty.It is being interpreted as a sign that reviewing the Indus water treaty may be one of the options on the table for India as a response to the Uri attack, in which 18 soldiers were killed by terrorists of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed.Amid the clamour for a strong response to the attack, PM Modi, in a fiery but measured speech in Kerala on Saturday, said: ""We are ready to fight you (Pakistan). If you have the courage. Come, we'll fight poverty in our country and you fight in yours. Let's see who eradicates poverty first. Let's fight to eradicate unemployment.""Experts are divided over the benefits of reneging on an international water sharing agreement which has withstood two full scale wars and frosty relations between the two countries.Unilaterally withdrawing from an international agreement means violating a legal treaty and India may end up inviting international condemnation, besides the anger of China.The Indus originates in China, and unlike India and Pakistan, it has not signed any international water sharing agreement. Should China decide to divert the Indus, India could lose as much as 36 per cent of river water.The Indus Waters Treaty was signed between India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan's president General Ayub Khan after World Bank brokered negotiations that lasted almost a decade.According to this agreement, control over the three eastern rivers - the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej - was given to India and the three western rivers - the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum - went to Pakistan.Under the treaty, India can use only 20 per cent of the water of the Indus, which flows through it first, for irrigation, transport and power generation.If India were to cut off supply to Pakistan, it could cause major crises in that country as a majority of its areas are dependent on Indus water.

497,"The Kitna Deti Hai problem is because of the government. ONGC and Oil India etc keep a huge profit margin for themselves to support an aging bloodsucking bureaucracy. How is it possible that a processed liter of petrol and diesel is somehow more expensive when crude prices are going down everywhere in the world? sarkari magic. 

A Maharaja mac is about Rs. 350 at McDonalds in India. Equivalent Big Mac would be about Rs. 500 at McD in the US. A liter of petrol is about Rs. 65 right now in India, while it's about Rs. 30 a liter in the US. Both countries import roughly the same percentage of oil and both have just about enough to support local needs. US is able to pay its oil processing workers the high wages it takes to buy those more expensive Big Macs and yet is somehow able to offer petrol at such a low price. The cost of transportation adds into everything and shows no signs of ever going down in India.

That's why the US population has fared through recession with relative ease despite near zero growth, while in India everyone (except the BMW class) is hit hard by inflation and even food is becoming a luxury despite consistent growth since 2008. Maybe Modi will do something about it in his 3rd term if it guarantees his 4th term.",2016-09-26 19:15:20
