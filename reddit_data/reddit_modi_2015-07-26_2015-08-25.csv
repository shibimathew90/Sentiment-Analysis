&gt; * But you throttled the development of Bihar because of your problems with one man, Modi said, referring to Kumar.

&gt; * The BJP and the JD(U), including its earlier avatar of Samata Party, were allies in Bihar for 17 years, before parting ways in mid-2013, when it was clear Modi was the NDAs prime ministerial candidate.

&gt; * Modi said Bihar would get Rs 3.75 lakh crore between 2015 and 2020; this amount, according to the previous devolution formula, would have been Rs 1.50 lakh crore, he said.As Modi landed in Patna, the Bihar CM, in a series of tweets, raised what he called seven critical issues on which people across India wanted to hear from the prime minister.

9,"Rest assured, Lalu will not be holding any portfolio when Nitish wins. May be one of his children will be given forest or health, but there is no way Nitish would let the RJD control his functionality. Nitish has been good for Bihar, and everyone knows that. Even Modi knows that. There's a reason why BJP has no CM candidate, because there is a lot of internal tussle within the state party cadre.

The only reason why Nitish isn't with the BJP is because there is a lot of ambition within Bihar BJP. The reason why Lalu and AAP are with Nitish is not because they like him, its because they hate BJP and want them out of the picture. Political alliances are not formed based on personal relations, but for mutual interest, and they exist to game the system. The current dynamics where JDU is bedding AAP and RJD, and BJP is bedding LJP and Manjhi balances the equation perfectly, for now. The right thing to do here is to bring back in Nitish because of the work he has done in the last two terms, and not worry about the alliances and support he has had to garner to keep BJP out. Modi might be a good PM, but he isn't taking up the CM post in Bihar if BJP wins the election. Let's not make this a Nitish Modi fight (which is what BJP Bihar is trying to do).",2015-07-26 07:41:57

&gt;* NEW DELHI: Political DNA analysis may come in handy in the electoral fray, but for solving a case and picking up clues from the scene of a crime, a Human DNA Profiling Bill is on the agenda.

&gt;* In the works since 2007, the Bill is now being pushed by none other PM Narendra Modi, whos keen to see it off the ground as a powerful technology for establishing identity in criminal or civil proceedings and for other specified purposes.The use of Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid( DNA) test for human profiling has triggered a debate.

&gt;* While Aadhaar devised ostensibly to provide targeted social subsidy, the objective of Human DNA Profiling Bill is to assist criminal/civil proceedings.

&gt;* The Human DNA Profiling Bill, 2015, draft admits that the DNA analysis offers sensitive information which, if misused can cause harm to person or society.

&gt;* There will be a DNA Profiling Board of eminent scientists, administrators and law enforcement officers to administer and carry out the functions assigned to it under the Act.

&gt; * Yet, the figure was lower than the 5,732 km achieved during 2012-13.The Narendra Modi government has cleared 1,231 projects for 37,000 km to meet its target for highways sector as part of a strategy to spur infrastructure development.The construction equipment industry , which saw a 10.8 per cent fall in demand in 2014-15, saw a turnaround in the first quarter of the current fiscal.The spurt in road construction led to a 93 per cent surge in bitumen imports in 2014-15, when 13 km of roads were built on average every day under the Modi government compared to 3 km in the last days of the previous regime.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) could not award the targeted projects due to the economic downturn in 2013-14.However, the government has decided to kick-start projects on the engineering, procurement and construction mode (EPC) which entails en tire funding from the Union budget.

&gt; * MUMBAI: The Centre's housing for all project is expected to give the economy a Rs 15-trillion boost over the next 7 years, but its success will depend on ramping up existing urban infrastructure , fast tracking approval process and targeting the actual beneficiary, a study said.

&gt; * ""The direct benefit of the housing for all scheme to the economy is estimated to be Rs 15 trillion in a seven-year timeframe (FY16-FY22),"" according to a report prepared by India Ratings.Funding the sizeable investment through public-private partnerships and ramping up the supply of raw materials for construction, namely steel and cement, were cited as 'big challenges' for the execution of the scheme.Municipal services such as supplying piped water, sewerage, sanitation and solid waste management are also not equipped to take on a project of this magnitude in the next seven years, the rating agency said.The economic impact of the scheme will be felt at the state level, the report noted and added that the biggest beneficiaries will be Uttar Pradesh , followed by Maharashtra and West Bengal, States where there is maximum housing demand.The plan is expected to increase employment opportunities and help grow the services sector, it added.Allied sectors to construction, such as cement, iron and steel, will also grow, depending on the strength of the forward and backward linkages of the construction sector with the rest of the economy.The Modi Government's ambitious scheme, aimed at providing 20 million houses in three phases over FY16-FY22, has a Central grant component (Rs 1 lakh per slum household) going to the states, while and Central assistance (Rs 1.5 lakh for other households) is likely to go directly to households, the report said.Also, the Central Government would provide interest subvention to households at 6.5 per cent for loans up to a 15-year tenor through two nodal agencies - Housing and Urban Development Corporation and National Housing Bank

And yet it leaves a few more glaring deficiencies: his inability to work with people he has differences with (in the party or outside), repeated failures in everything he has dabbled in thus far (almost stepped out of politics after the LS debacle), complete lack of gratitude (tossed Anna aside after he was through with IAC, insulted and kicked out Bhushan despite the man having given crores to help fund AAP), incompetence (repeatedly disrespects the Constitution, laws, and procedures, and lacks understanding thereof) ... we can go on and on.

---

&gt;* On a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi ripped into Nitish Kumar at a mega election rally in north Bihar's Muzaffarpur, one of his party leaders Shatrughan Sinha met the Bihar Chief Minister at his residence in Patna.

&gt;* ""It was a courtesy call and I consider him as guardian of the state,"" Mr Sinha said after the meeting.

&gt;* The other parliamentarian from Patna, Ram Kripal Yadav, is a minister in the Centre.He, however, said that the meeting should not be accorded a political colour.

&gt;* ""If I go and meet Kumar over a cup of tea, no meaning should be attached to it,"" he said.Sources close to Mr Sinha insist the meeting was to discuss development projects being executed by the Bihar government in his constituency.Mr Sinha was present on Saturday morning at the function where Mr Modi launched a host of central government schemes for Bihar.

&gt;* He had, however, skipped a function a few days ago in Patna where BJP chief Amit Shah flagged off some 250-odd hi-tech campaign raths, saying he was not invited.A few days ago, Mr Sinha had said that leaders like Ram Vilas Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi should be considered being named as NDA's chief ministerial candidate for Bihar polls despite clear indications from the BJP that it will fight the state elections with Mr Modi as their main face.The outspoken actor was among the voices critical of the BJP's decision to project Mr Modi as the star of its 2014 election campaign.

34,"&gt;I agree with the argument that shifting controls will not magically fix all our problems.

Then why you're supporting it.

&gt;But for me it comes down to the matter of trust. Me and many Delhi citizens trust the AAP government more to run the police effectively and fix accountability. 

Remember all 7 MPs are from Same BJP, So Delhi citizens voted for BJP. too 

&gt;The ACB under AAP was indeed doing a good job, until it was turned into a mere joke after the appointment of Meena, by the Lt. Governor.There were no new cases filed in ACB for a long time after the appointment of Meena. 


Really what good job ?? And Kejriwal wanted a Bihar cadre officer that's why his recommendation cancelled.


&gt;I agree that Kejriwal shouldn't have politicized the issue of girl getting stabbed. But it doesn't change the fact that she was desperately trying to register a case with the Delhi Cops, and they didn't do shit about it.


Kejriwal not only shamelessly politicized that poor girl's murder he directly blamed BJP/DP/Modi for it and run some really disgraceful self loathing ads on TV. Also DP did registered the case against the culprits but they got out on bail.



&gt;So, my question is, why not give AAP a chance?

There are 1000 of things which are already under AAP, which they can improve or show promise but so far its been a literal shit-fest they even backed down on their core promises (Lokpal, Swaraj etc), their law minster is in Jail, daily hooliganism by their MLAs , Party founders forcefully kicked out , they already given plum postings to over a 100 party members, they even blatantly started nepotism by appointing that Maliwal as DCW chief...so as of today AAP is no different from other Political parties.",2015-07-26 17:00:29

&gt;* Irrespective of our political leanings and beliefs, we can agree to the fact that Dr. Shashi Tharoor is one of the top debators of the country.

&gt;* At the end of the speech making a passionate case for even symbolic reparations Tharoor says The abilty to acknowledge a wrong that has been done, to simply say sorry will go a far far longer way than some percentage of GDP.

39,"&gt; So when it suits you, Delhi is DC and India is US? Stop the hypocrisy. I just showed you that there is a working model where police is under local government. 

I think you missed this statement from my previous comment - ""I don't think anyone made the claims that all capitals are treated the same way.""

Some folks were crying about this atrocity on Delhi. So, I showed with DC example that they are not unique in their situation. I didn't say Delhi = DC. I showed that there are cities that follow this model, and Delhi-wala's aren't the victim of some Modi conspiracy. And then you brought in London and I presented you with Paris.  

&gt; So don't give bullshit excuses that it is not possible. 

Of course, it is possible. Just like it is possible that all Indian politicians will act mature and responsible. But you can not design something on ""it's possible"", you design system on what's most likely and what's going to work in those situation. 

And given immaturity and lack of accountability of Indian politicians, we can not let federal govt be held hostage by state govt, as and when it pleases them. 

&gt;  Central govt operates from New Delhi

Are airport, railways stations, highways all in ND? if not then Delhi govt can easily block/stop people from traveling to ND.

DC's police is controlled by the local govt, not the Federal govt. And in France, the whole country's police is under the National Government, so that is not a correct comparison either, Delhi's situation is indeed unique. And Delhi isn't even the Capital of India.

&gt; * The hounding of Teesta Setalvad is timed to coincide with the publicly articulated urge of the Prime Minister to get a ""clean chit"" from the courts in relation to the ongoing cases in Gujarat, which Teesta has been doggedly pursuing.

&gt; * She is the victim of the pursuit for justice.We are being asked to roll back the clock, consign the 2002 Gujarat carnage to the dustbin of history and replace Teesta Setalvad as the villain, who hounded the then chief minister...Can the collective amnesia on the Gujarat riots, and the view that we must move on be legitimized?All this could possibly happen if Zakia Jafri and Teesta Setalvad, who are doing everything constitutionally and legally possibe to hold the head of the then government accountable, are checkmated, preferably gagged, and put into jail.Zakia's criminal revision petition is not about seeking recourse to justice for one incident of massacre, where her husband was brutally hacked and burnt to death but about the larger issue of command responsibility of the then CM, and now PM, in failing to prevent the killings from taking place.It is high time this country saw the emergence of the Doctrine of Command Responsibility as a statutory and constitutional imperative, rather than leaving it to the notoriously weak provisions of the Indian Penal Code, which address only crime by individuals and punish only the hand that kills.

&gt; * Conspiricies are not easy to prove, but judging from the attack on Teesta Setalvad, the PM seems worried and insecure that there is an off chance, maybe just an off chance, that some well-meaning judge might accept the evidence pointing out the massive failure of his constitutional duty to prevent the killings.

&gt; * It is the courts of this country that are on trial, not Teesta.As for the proverbial wine and visits to the beauty parlour, apart from the fact that they sustain the myth of the ""five-star"" activists, I must remind the courts that they hold their own legal aid meetings spending money meant for the poor in seven-star hotels.

&gt;* Meanwhile, the feeding frenzy at the corporate trough has crossed the Rs 42 trillion mark this year (or US $678 billion, if youre among those whose overseas stash the Narendra Modi government has pledged to bring back to our sacred shores).

&gt;* Union finance minister Arun Jaitley told a gushing TV anchor last year that he hoped there would be no return to wasteful subsidies under the NDA government.

&gt;* And remember this: these handouts through budgetary baksheesh for billionaires are only one part of many such processes through which enormous amounts of public money are given away to the rich and famous (but for the banks and media, they are mostly anonymous).

&gt;* Never mind that when its the less privileged, banks run advertisements in newspapers (as those in AP did in the past decade), naming petty defaulters and carrying details of public auctions of their gold ornaments to recover a few thousand rupees.

&gt;* The media are okay with that, although they mostly stayed silent when the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) named several hundreds of bigger defaulters late last year.

53,"&gt; When you read about Kashmir also read about how Junagad and other such kingdoms were annexed you may find the similarities and yet the ensuing different outcome interesting. 

But they could have done all that without losing a big chunk of Kashmir in 1947-48. Diplomacy is not about being fair but about doing best for your own country.

&gt; Also, if we can have a normal discussion, to be honest there are some parallels between Kashmir and what was East Pakistan, in the desire of the general majority populace of the two regions. 

Most country in position power will not let go of a region, India did. But Kashmir is even more important than just a region - water, mountain cover from neighbors, control to china. 

&gt; And to see how India (read: achieved) helped East Pakistan gain freedom without majorly getting effected in the international diplomatic circles I would say that it was something Pakistan can only wish to have right now vis-a-vis Kashmir. 

Well for that India would have systematically mistreat Kashmir region and exclude them from power (neither is happening) and then Indian army will go on a 6 month long killing spree where hundreds of thousands will be butchered. 

&gt; I would say that it was something Pakistan can only wish to have right now vis-a-vis Kashmir. 

Things might change in future, you know. India become less popular, China may feel cocky enough to intervene while US is embroiled in some other issues. 

Leaving an issue unresolved is not a cause for celebration. 

&gt; To top that of if I can be blunt-er the current Baloch crisis and how India has managed Afghanistan and Iran against Pakistan I would say Indian foreign policy and diplomacy is much more intelligent, analytical and shrewder.

This is completely different from Kashmir issue. If India have handled 47-48 properly, then there may not be a need for this. 

Either way this was more in response to terrorism in Punjab and Kashmir. 

&gt; But for all the patriotism at display during pre-election how this govt. deals with China would be the real display of Indian policy strength under NDA.

Past congress govts might have done a decent job. But UPA govt was quite poor in containing China's influence in the region. Our PMs/Leaders rarely visited neighboring countries or offered them bigger role/support like Modi has done in Nepal. Also, UPA wasn't as active in building partnership with south east asian, east asian and oceana countries as Modi has been. 

We don't know what will come off it in future but I hope that our shipping lanes aren't constrained in Arabian sea / Indian ocean / pacific ocean. ",2015-07-27 01:18:53

80,"Not excusing the probable corruption angle, but IMHO the whole process of planning, funding, disbursal, management, verification, and accounting is fucked up. There are too many steps and modalities with not nearly enough automation or transparency. The fact that this certification part of the process dates back 40 or more years means the process has remained unchanged from the time when slide rules were used for calculations.

While Modi is ""electronificating"" the process, I believe the process itself should be changed. All accounting trails must be electronic, including approval and disbursal (easily do-able with SecurID type passwords). The entire trail, from GoI's accounts to the wages of the daily wage laborer should be made a matter of public, transparent and mine-able.

&gt;* Modi was keen on improving perennially difficult relations with Pakistan as he focused on the big picture: the security scenario in South Asia.

&gt;* There were talks about resumption of bilateral cricket ties between the two nations at the end of this year, but BCCI secretary and BJP leader Anurag Thakur said it might not be possible under such circumstances.

&gt;* The provocation came from reports that the three heavily-armed gunmen involved in the attack were from Pakistan, who had entered Punjab after sneaking into Jammu and Kashmir under covering fire from Pakistani troops.

114,"Mihir S Sharma: The people are silent

---

&gt;* Consider, for example, the incredible silence  the complicity, in fact  of almost the entire political, intellectual and journalistic class in what is so obvious a vendetta it looks like its being directed by Francis Ford Coppola: the witch-hunt against Teesta Setalvad.

&gt;* But it is frankly laughable to imagine that the 18-hour long raids, the interrogations, the leaks and so on are anything but a vindictive campaign of harassment  payback for Ms Setalvads highly visible stand on the 2002 Gujarat riots.

&gt;* We have reached a point when even institutions that provide non-partisan, expert guidance and advice to the prime minister, such as on say Indias strategic trajectory, can be shut down  and replaced by an informal network of committed people known to Nagpur and the PM.

&gt;* I sometimes worry  and I hope Im wrong  that, just as China moves towards some form of limited, managed, illiberal popular democracy, that India too will symmetrically reduce those elements of dissent and independence in its current polity that have made it unique.

&gt;* The Russians and the Chinese think theyve cracked the code; Mr Modi, in his harassment of opponents, his licencing of NGOs, his accusation that they serve foreign interests, is just following in Vladimir Putins 15-year-old footsteps.

&gt; * The NDA government has so far repealed 125 obsolete laws through two similar bills introduced and passed by both Houses of Parliament.

&gt; * On a reference made from the law ministry to review discrimination against affected people, the law commission had recently submitted a report along with a draft bill that not only recommends repeal of the Lepers Act 1898 but seeks special privileges that are available for dalits and other marginalized classes of society.

&gt; * The latest bill will seeks to scrap a total of 295 obsolete acts, including 157 which were part of a third amendment bill which was earlier withdrawn by the government last week since some of the laws mentioned in it had already been struck off.

When 25,000 people, including a large section of women march from Gandhi Ashram to Gujarat Vidyapeeth to protest at any relaxation, he had to take note.

&gt;**Science is beloved of the Indian middle class and particularly of the Hindu patriarchs of the Sangh parivar.** In India, Real Men all study Science. Boys are programmed from an early age to make Science their chief obsession. The IITs are shrines to a certain high Hindu male technological libido.

&gt;**Atomic scientists, writes scientist Dhirendra Sharma, are a ‘super State’ within the State, comprising shadowy brahmanical scientists (mostly all Tam-Brahms and the occasional bawa like Bhabha) living antiseptic and secretive lives, loftily distant from the dirty masses.**

&gt;They are pampered by the government, ferried back and forth to spotless fortified labs where they carryout incomprehensible expensive experiments. **Atomic scientists are the extremely powerful but invisible brahmins of India. Scientism is, in fact, nothing but a version of Hindu Brahminism.** 

&gt;Let’s carry out a survey. Murli Manohar Joshi is a physicist. So is NCERT Director J.S. Rajput. BP Singhal is an MSc. Pramod Mahajan is an MSc. Former RSS Sarsangchalak Rajju Bhaiyya taught physics at Allahabad University. Jaswant Singh is a BSc. KS Sudarshan is a telecommunications engineer. And what subject did MS Golwalkar study at Benares Hindu University? Science, of course! **Science, suggests Australian writer Dan Madigan, is particularly compatible with religious fundamentalism.**

Dear God. This is the mentality of one of the most respected and 'intellectual' journalists in modern India! 

I am thinking of how today's media keeps whining about how the Modi government is being unscientific, appointing RSS guys, Smriti Irani's educational qualifications etc. **10 years ago when the BJP government actually brought credible scientists on board this same media was STILL abusive and equated science with Hindutva/Brahminism!**

What a farce these guys are. These so called 'intellectuals' with their mock outrage on whatever issue.

&gt;* I then went on to point out that the Modi Government had not only continued the foreign policy of the UPA, but done so by reversing most of the BJP's positions in Opposition on issues ranging from the Indo-US nuclear deal to the Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement.Even the emphasis on economic diplomacy with which the Prime Minister was being credited, I said, was nothing more than the implementation of what I have dubbed the Manmohan Doctrine, which posits that the overriding objective of Indian foreign policy is the economic transformation and development of India.

&gt;* I added, for good measure, that where the Modi Government had departed from its predecessor, it had embarrassed itself and the nation - pointing, in detail, to the yo-yo-like pendulum swings of our policy pronouncements and actions on Pakistan and Israel.It was, in other words, a nuanced analysis, mixed but far more critical than laudatory, as anyone present in the audience (or a glance at the video - where I start at 5:50 and go on for eight minutes).

&gt;* I pointed out that I had thirty years of published work at odds with what Mr Modi and his party stood for, but that was irrelevant to the commentators: the Prime Minister had praised me, so that must mean I was on his side.There's something terribly wrong with this picture.

&gt;* Instead, everyone is reduced to a stock caricature, defined in absolute terms by their party affiliation alone.This is a disservice to our democracy - which, as Amartya Sen has pointed out, is supposed to be a process of deliberative reasoning, resulting in the best outcomes for the nation as a whole.

137,"British historian John MacKenzie on why Britain does not owe reparations to India.

---

&gt; * At the end of May, the Oxford Union held a debate on the motion ""This house believes Britain owes reparations to her former colonies"".

&gt; * There can be little doubt that the British, by ultimately forcing the princely states into the independent state of India, helped to unify India while at the same time partitioning it and, it might be argued, protecting it from the tensions and problems that a much larger Muslim population might have produced.

&gt; * It can indeed be said that India's share of world GDP declined dramatically between, say, 1800 and 1947, but it must be remembered that economic revolutions, massive shifts in world population, and the dramatic expansion of other economies were all taking place throughout Europe, in the United States, in Latin America, Australasia, and the Far East during this period.

&gt; * The calculation of reparations, their payment, ensuring that they went in the direction of the poorer in society, and their contribution to economic growth for all, would all be fraught with difficulties.

&gt;* Incidentally, the glitch happens to be at the end of BJP ruled Gujarat government which is yet to respond to Home Ministry's request to confirm transfer of suitable land to the elite commando force.

&gt;* Soon after becoming prime minister, Modi gave fresh push to the proposal and the Gujarat government responded by offering land measuring about 41 acre suitable enough for establishing a NSG hub.

&gt;* Keen to give shape to PM's pet project, a team of senior NSG officials visited Gandhinagar the same month but to their dismay it found out that the land that is being offered measures not 41 but 36 acres.

&gt;* On May 8, the union home ministry again wrote to the Gujarat government asking it to confirm the status of transfer of the land to NSG free of cost so that requisite approval Centre can be conveyed on the project.

---

&gt; * AHMEDABAD:The Gujarat government has refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed SIT to file an appeal in a higher court seeking death penalty for former minister Maya Kodnani in the Naroda Patiya riot case.This was decided on the basis of advocate general Kamal Trivedi's opinion that there was ""no direct evidence"" against her.Maya Kodnani and Bajrang Dal activist Babu Bajrangi, along with 30 others, were sentenced to life imprisonment in the 2002 post-Godhra Naroda Patiya riot case, in which 96 people were killed.

&gt; * ""State legal department, on the basis of advocate general's opinion, has taken a decision not to file an appeal against the special court's order and not to seek death penalty for Maya Kodnani,"" Prashant Desai, who has been appointed special prosecutor for SIT (special investigation team) in Gujarat high court for the case, told PTI today.

&gt; * ""Advocate general has opined that there is no direct evidence against Maya Kodnani and she was convicted only on the basis of other evidence and hence state government should think not to seek death penalty in her case,"" said Desai.

&gt; * ""However, Gujarat government has given a go ahead to SIT to seek death penalty for Babu Bajrangi and four others accused who were sentenced for life by the designated court,"" he said.Earlier, the state government had given the permission to SIT to seek death penalty for Kodnani, Bajrangi and eight others in connection with the case.But in May this year, apparently under pressure of right wing forces, the state government made a U-turn and withdrew its permission to seek death penalty and now, except for Kodnani, it has given its consent to SIT.Joint secretary, legal department, JJ Pandya had sent a communication on August 30 to SIT member Ashish Bhatia with regard to the decision taken on Naroda Patiya case appeals and that was forwarded to Desai on September 7, 2013.Now, the state legal department has given its permission to SIT to seek death penalty for five convicts, which include Bajrangi, Suresh Langado, Premchand Tiwari, Suresh Netlekar and Manu Maruda, who were sentenced to life.Kodnani, who was earlier a minister in the Modi government, was sentenced to 28 years in prison by a special court in August 2012 in the Naroda Patiya riot case.Babu Bajrangi was sentenced to jail for his entire life, while eight others were given 31 years' jail term each in the same case.Also, 22 other convicts were awarded 24 years' jail while 29 accused were acquitted in the case.As the state government, on the basis of opinion expressed by state Advocate General Kamal Trivedi, has given a go ahead to SIT for filing appeal against designated court's order, the SIT is expected to shortly file it before the high court, sources said.

169,"&gt;The only argument here is why is a mass murderer at the top in this country.

Well that's easily answered. It's because 31% of indian voters voted for BJP.

&gt;All other arguments are moot.

I beg to differ. Rational and logic are all we have to evolve and mature as a nation. So no, it's not moot at all.

&gt;India will finally pay for it, just like Germany had to pay for supporting Hitler.

I sense some dissatisfaction in your tone regarding the election of the current Prime Minister of India. For argument's sake let's agree that modi was indeed responsible for the riots. Even then it wouldn't be as bad as what the nazis did. The question you have to ask yourself is if a nazi like regime were to be set up, concentration camps were to be set up would it get the support of 1) the military and b) the people. 

The army is one of those institutions which has not seen a divide on religious grounds. You can not be a dictator if you don't command an army. One things most indian are proud of is the fact that we have regular elections and a functioning democracy (disregarding the number of reforms it needs), and i doubt whether the army would support any person who wants to get rid of it. 

Politics after cricket and bollywood is the next popular pastime in this country. Everybody has got some opinion and everybody knows which party is best. Ramchandra Guha said that the reason india has been able to avoid balkanization as many pundits at the time of independence had predicted is because of people's faith in democracy. Indian democracy for all its flaws and shortcomings does one thing brilliant : the division of power. Regional parties are able to dictate national polices at times because of their numbers. The thousands of people, old and young, poor and rich, hindus and muslims all queue up to cast their votes in the scorching sun. We take our right to vote very seriously and i don't think we will sit quietly and let a dictatorship happen.

Now lets explore that point about people not accepting a nazi like regime further. Despite there being communal hatred everywhere i don't think most people would want a party which is divisive. After the gujarat riots, in the next general elections everybody was expecting the BJP to retain power and win convincingly. The headlines in Times of India read ""Indians Surprise Indians"" as congress had won that election. Think about it, a party headed by a roman catholic women of italian origin, who everyone thought was going to be the next PM had been elected to power after the gujarat riots had taken place. 

Ask yourself why did the BJP lost just after the riots? The answer is simple, indians at large won't accept a party which indulges in communal hatred. There are too many reasons why the BJP won this time. One of which is the way the congress party had abused its position and the number of scams that took place. But despite my cynicism and the worry of loosing the idea of india, i would bet that most indians will not accept a party or a rule which is found to be practicing communal divide. The BJP has been voted in the power not because of its perceived hatred of muslims but because of the promises made on development and corruption. Take this sub reddit for example, there are many people here who say that they voted for BJP and are now disappointed that they are being let down. 

To really drive home the point i am making  let me point the electroal results of the last assembly election in Delhi, from where BJP had won convincingly in the general elections but failed miserably during the state elections. If people were really looking for a anti-muslim party then the BJP  because they are perceived as one the most, would have won lopsidedly.

Lastly, Modi seems like he is driven to develop india. That's what keeps him going. I don't think we have seen a prime minister who was so devoted to the development of india in our recent history. He genuinely seems like he wants india to develop and become a major power. He is smart enough to realize that a divided india is never going to prosper. 

So i think your fears of indians having to pay for electing modi is ill founded. Personally i don't think most people in BJP nor the current PM hates muslims. I don't think we are going to see  concentration camps being set up. Remember this is a country where hindus and muslims had lived together peacefully for centuries before the brits showed up. Yes there are these hindu fanatics but they don't hold any power. And the moment there is even a hint of the government indulging in any divisive activity the people will remove them from power in the next elections.

In the case of the United States, when there is an attack against US citizens, especially by external aggressors, there will be an official statement in as less time as possible by the President. There is the full force and weight of the world's number 1 superpower behind whatever words the President utters.

But things are not so simple for India and her leader. Past Prime Ministers have resorted to ""strong condemnations"" of such acts. But those words and phrases have started sounding hollow and become a butt of jokes now. Our current leader has to find a delicate balance between the two extremes of empty, hollow condemnations by past Indian PMs and outright threats and declarations of aggression of US Presidents. It's not easy.

In such a situation, I would rather have Modi carry out whatever action is necessary to cause pain to the perpetrators of these actions, than utter any empty or controversial words. At the least, I have some confidence that between Modi and Doval, some action will be taken.",2015-07-30 09:54:19

The ONLY evidence for this comes not from broken viharas (of which some evidence must exist to this day, we can still see substantial evidence of Vaishanavite temples converted to Shaivaite temples for instance) or backed by other sources, but only from Huan Tsang. Huan Tsang was...Buddhist, his patron was...Harsha a Buddhist. Harsha was at war with? Yes, Shashanka whose kingdom was pretty soon assimilated into? The Pushyabuthi dynasty. Now here are some more...fun facts. Did Huan Tsang's allegations at least make it into history unaltered? Heck no. This comes to us via the Harasacharita (memoirs of Harsha) written by Banabatta about one generation AFTER Harsha died.

This is like some historian 500 years from now taking ""Modi is a Muslim baby eating ogre who operates via Ajit Doval and runs terror camps inside Pakistan"" type bs and then using it as historical fact.

You could please go through Thapar, Habib or Majumdar and tell me if you see them using at least one other source to corroborate this lie and I will agree with you.

Edit - Bonus fun fact - Buddhist texts have proven to be historically very...vague and biased at times. For instance they even boosted Ashoka's evil ratings by a factor of 10000 by throwing in stuff like ""he built a hell house on earth where he slayed 1000's"" just to get their propaganda across. Forgive me if one Buddhist monk's version whose patron was a Buddhist emperor who was at war with the same person his person spread tales about is something I find hard to believe and none of the historians I have read have come up with anything other than Hsuang Tsang (sp?) and Harshacharita.",2015-07-30 10:19:05

193,"&gt;The death sentence in India is reserved for the 'rarest of rare' cases. Of course the judges have the power to choose which ones, but at least in recent times they reserve this judgement only for cases like that of Yakub which dealt with mass murder of nearly 300 people.

Wrong. While judges do hand out the sentence. The demand for it is made by the lawyer representing the govt. (Public Prosecutor and others on Govt's payroll.) And the govt. gets to decide what sentence it should demand and they can even scuttle the chances of conviction by not making a strong enough case. In which case again the choice to appeal or not appeal once again rests with the government.

In case of the Naroda Patiya Massacre,  The govt. chose not to press for a death sentence for Babu Bajrangi/Maya Kodnani. This was the same Gujarat Government run by Narenda Modi where **after her role in the massacre** Maya Kodnani had been given a party ticket to contest assembly elections and then elevated to a cabinet minister. 

You have to be utterly naive to think that her proximity and good rapport with the people running the Government of Gujarat didn't have any role in the government deciding not to press for the death penalty.

&gt;* Linking the Gurdaspur attack to Pakistan, Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the three terrorists had infiltrated from there to carry out the strike and asserted that the government will do everything possible to prevent cross-border terrorism.

&gt;* However, as the unrelenting Congress members continued to shout slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Singh said, I take this opportunity to assure the House that the government is firmly to root out terrorism from India.

&gt;* It is also suspected, he said, that the same terrorists had planted five IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) on the railway track near Talwandi village between Dinanagar and Jhakoladi which were subsequently defused by the bomb disposal squad.

&gt;* In his statement, the Home Minister narrated the sequence of events of July 27 when three heavily-armed terrorists dressed in Army uniforms struck in Gurdaspur at around 5.30 a.m. and stormed the police station, leading to a 12-hour gunbattle.

&gt;* The government offers its heartfelt condolences to the families of civilians and security force personnel killed in this terror attack and wishes the speedy recovery of injured persons, he added.

217,"Gujarat government asks SIT not to seek death penalty for Maya Kodnani

---

&gt;* The Gujarat government today refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) to file an appeal in a higher court seeking death penalty for former minister Maya Kodnani in the Naroda Patiya massacre case.This was decided on the basis of Advocate General Kamal Trivedi's opinion that there was ""no direct evidence"" against her.

&gt;* The AG, however, has given the go-ahead for filing death penalty pleas against Bajrang Dal activist Babu Bajrangi and four other people convicted in the case.Kodnani was sentenced to 28 years in prison by a court last year.

&gt;* Importantly, the trial court while convicting Kodnani, had termed her a prime conspirator.In April this year, the Gujarat government set up a three-member team of public prosecutors to prepare groundwork for filing an appeal seeking death penalty for Kodnani, Bajrangi and four others.But in May, it did a U-turn directing the team to hold the filing of the plea till a final opinion was obtained from the Advocate General's office.Today, the AG's office submitted its report to the state government stating that there was no need to enhance Kodnani's sentence to death.The Narendra Modi government had faced flak over the U-turn since it was construed as a decision being taken under pressure from the Sangh Parivar.Kodnani, a doctor by profession, is the first MLA and the highest-ranking politician to be convicted in a Gujarat riots case.The three-time Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Naroda was an RSS star in Gujarat and despite the serious criminal charges against her in the riots case, she was made the state's Minister for Women and Child Development in 2007 by Mr Modi.Kodnani, Bajrangi and 29 others were convicted last August for the murder of 97 Muslims in Naroda Patiya, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, in the riots that engulfed Gujarat in February 2002.While Kodnani was given a 28-year prison term, Babu Bajrangi was ordered to spend the rest of his life in prison.

1984:

Maxwell Pereira, no 2 police officer of north delhi, ordered his men to provide security in sis ganj gurdwara. Kamal Nath was trying to provoke the mob in that area. Police used tear gas and only after a meager reinforcement came, Pereira, moved to nearby Town Hall, where sikh shops were put on fire. There he did something which no other police officer did, in both 1984 and 2002. He ordered firing. Shiv Prasan of kotwali police station, did first fire and killed a rioter in full view. Pereira did something unimaginable then. He went to loud speaker and announced 200 rupees award for the constable. That worked. Rioters went back. 

This is the only example of firm police action in 1984.

2002:

Police men were there, but for a different reason. Media was also there. However that didn't stop Naroda Patiya or Gulberg society massacre from happening. AFAIK, there was only one officer who stood against chief minister and more importantly, home minister, Modi. He is R.B. Sreekumar. You can read his deposition before Nanavati commission here - http://www.cjponline.org/gujaratTrials/statecomp/pdf%20files/R%20B%20Sreekumar's%20affidavits/pdf/Affidavit%202%206%20OCT%202004.pdf

Important to note, that Nanavati is the judge who headed the commission of 1984 riot, after Misra commission. And he was the judge who headed the judicial commission again in 2002 riots. Also, the SIT was headed by R.K. Raghavan. Incidentally, it was Raghavan who was the head of security in the function where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. India, my friend, is weird.

It wasn't till the last few months before and after the elections did the media actually treat him and his government positively. And even that was short lived.

&gt;This new line of argument is picking and choosing issues which did need to be brought into the press and argued, in other words the unavoidables.

Yes, whenever any previously unknown local Hindu group anywhere in India said something controversial it was suddenly elevated to headlines and Modi asked to personally answer for it as if he/BJP/RSS had plotted it. When some C-grade journo travelled to Pakistan and met with Hafiz Saeed it was painted as some official government diplomatic mission because of inane reasons like *'He is an associate of Baba Ramdev!'* and *'Could the GOI be unaware of what its citizens are doing in Pakistan?

230,"Dude - I cannot believe my ears ... Here you go ...

In this country of dirty politics and no hope ... he stood above the rest and shone the light of hope to the coming generations... Though he was selected and elected by politicians ... he made sure he was spotless while standing in the centre of the muck.

Just to start off - when he was nominated by BJP - he refused to let the politicians pay the security deposit for his election - and paid from his pocket. Though there was strict protocols to be followed when dignitaries visited Rashtrapathi Bhavan - he used to take dignitaries for a walk in the Gardens while discussing national matters. 

This is something I saw live on TV - when the vice-president died - Kalam had come with his security detail to pay his respects as the President. He removed his shoes - walked up and put flowers .... and when he was walking back - forgot his shoes and got into his car. It was only then he realized that he has not put his shoes - got out of the car went back got his shoes and got back into the car.

Kalam was elected after the Gujarat riots. KR Narayan was the president when it happen - and had not acted or reacted. After Kalam became the president - he decided to tour the riot hit areas - and there was nothing Modi could do - though he had banned media. Here also - Kalam stopped his entourage and started touring on foot and talking to people. Every politician - BJP &amp; Congress shit their pants!!!

When he went on foreign visits - the host nations were very careful in preparing his itinerary. He is not like the usual sleeping politicians who visit other countries for watching football matches and enjoying - he actually took interest and asked questions ... sometimes beyond the understanding of the people who were trying to explain things to him. 

For the first time in my life time - there was some one in who represented India - for whom people stood up due to actual respect ... not just cause he was some president.

His interaction with children and youth made him a legend. He showed them that there was hope ... there was light ... if he could make it so could every one else. Here was a man who was supposed to be a rubber stamp ... but his words and actions carried weight like no one else in history of modern India. This is one man - no one man, woman, political party, community, sect, cast, religion or state could claim as their own - he stood above all of them.

---

&gt; * AHMEDABAD:The Gujarat government has refused permission to the Supreme Court-appointed SIT to file an appeal in a higher court seeking death penalty for former minister Maya Kodnani in the Naroda Patiya riot case.This was decided on the basis of advocate general Kamal Trivedi's opinion that there was ""no direct evidence"" against her.Maya Kodnani and Bajrang Dal activist Babu Bajrangi, along with 30 others, were sentenced to life imprisonment in the 2002 post-Godhra Naroda Patiya riot case, in which 96 people were killed.

&gt; * ""State legal department, on the basis of advocate general's opinion, has taken a decision not to file an appeal against the special court's order and not to seek death penalty for Maya Kodnani,"" Prashant Desai, who has been appointed special prosecutor for SIT (special investigation team) in Gujarat high court for the case, told PTI today.

&gt; * ""Advocate general has opined that there is no direct evidence against Maya Kodnani and she was convicted only on the basis of other evidence and hence state government should think not to seek death penalty in her case,"" said Desai.

&gt; * ""However, Gujarat government has given a go ahead to SIT to seek death penalty for Babu Bajrangi and four others accused who were sentenced for life by the designated court,"" he said.Earlier, the state government had given the permission to SIT to seek death penalty for Kodnani, Bajrangi and eight others in connection with the case.But in May this year, apparently under pressure of right wing forces, the state government made a U-turn and withdrew its permission to seek death penalty and now, except for Kodnani, it has given its consent to SIT.Joint secretary, legal department, JJ Pandya had sent a communication on August 30 to SIT member Ashish Bhatia with regard to the decision taken on Naroda Patiya case appeals and that was forwarded to Desai on September 7, 2013.Now, the state legal department has given its permission to SIT to seek death penalty for five convicts, which include Bajrangi, Suresh Langado, Premchand Tiwari, Suresh Netlekar and Manu Maruda, who were sentenced to life.Kodnani, who was earlier a minister in the Modi government, was sentenced to 28 years in prison by a special court in August 2012 in the Naroda Patiya riot case.Babu Bajrangi was sentenced to jail for his entire life, while eight others were given 31 years' jail term each in the same case.Also, 22 other convicts were awarded 24 years' jail while 29 accused were acquitted in the case.As the state government, on the basis of opinion expressed by state Advocate General Kamal Trivedi, has given a go ahead to SIT for filing appeal against designated court's order, the SIT is expected to shortly file it before the high court, sources said.

235,"The thing what I don't understand is how has this issue become related to BJP/Modi? Very roughly speaking, people are polarized on Yakub Memon along roughly the same lines as they are on BJP/Modi. Like, the same people who are very anti-Modi are also opposing the death sentence Yakub Memon. You know, celebs like Naseeruddin Shah, Mahesh Bhatt, social right activists, people on social media and so on. Similarly, people who are pro-Modi are also supporting the execution, and branding the other group of people as ""anti-nationals"" and ""adarsh liberals"" and so on. Now, of course there are exceptions to all of this, but this seems to be a general trend to me. You can see this polarization to a certain extent even in our own sub.

I am quite amazed by this because as far as I can see, there is no role that BJP or Modi has to play in this trial. So, there is some underlying variable that influences both someone's inclination to oppose BJP and support Memon. ",2015-07-30 22:32:55

245,"&gt; whether I should appreciate or be concerned about this sense of brotherhood.

The whole thing has very deep religious undertones from the get go. The blasts were a reaction to the mosque demolition, no two ways around it. It is extremely shitty of  No matter how extreme, a community which feels alienated from the rest (irrespective of whose fault it is) will react like this.

&gt; Imagine the situation if Babu Bhajrangi is hanged tomorrow

Think of a similar case, the Gujrat riots, mostly reactionary, very brotherhood-ish reactions from people all over the country. The number of people I talked to, who have tried to justify the riots based on the train burning is astounding. 

How do two wrongs make a right, idk. I am certain a lot of muslims feel the same way about the Mumbai riots and the blasts. Again, no idea how 2 wrongs make a right.

Given how politically influential people get away with about anything in this country, there is no way to truly know what role Modi / people under his orders played in the 2002 riots. 

So from one point of view, let alone mourning on being hanged, we have placed our entire country in the hands of someone who some of them consider at least a negligent ruler, at most a terrorist.

PS: I am just trying to explain the underlying feelings of brotherhood/alienation I can figure from their behavior. 

Personally, I have decided to place my trust in our courts on both accounts (Yakub's role in the Mum blasts and Modi's role the Guj riots)

More personal thoughts:

Why the fuck do we have to associate with someone who was at least heavily involved/ at most 50% reason behind a series of blasts is beyond me. I don't mean to diminish the religious sentiment that got hurt by the demolition of the masjid but at the end of the day, it was a fucking building.

254,"Rough translation (Hindi is not my first language, so please correct any mistakes)

वाराणसी में अखिल भारतीय हिंदू महासभा ने ग्यानवापी मस्जिद के पास स्थित मंदिर में 'जलाभिषेक' के लिए देशभर से कार्यकर्ताओं को आमंत्रित किया है। 

In Varanasi, the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha has invited workers from across the country for a 'jalabhishek' ceremony at a temple near Gyanvapi Masjid. 

यहां इस तरह की धार्मिक गतिविधियां प्रतिबंधित हैं। ऐसे में माना जा रहा है कि हिंदू महासभा का ये कदम वाराणसी में माहौल को खराब कर सकता है। उल्लेखनीय है कि वाराणसी प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी का संसदीय क्षेत्र है। 

This type of religious activities have been forbidden at this location. It is being said that this will disturb the atmosphere of the community. Notably this is the constituency of PM Modi.

महासभा के कार्यकर्ताओं का कहना है कि उनका यह आयोजन देश को इस्लाम मुक्त बनाने के अभियान का हिस्सा है। 

Hindu Mahasabha workers say that this event is part of their campaign for a Muslim-free country.

जलाभिषेक के लिए 3 अगस्त का दिन चुना गया है। 3 अगस्त को ही सावन का पहला सोमवार भी है जिस दिन हिंदुओं में शिव प्रतिमा पर जलाभिषेक करने की परंपरा है। 

The 'jalabhishek' will occur on 3 August. 3 August is the first Monday of the month, and the day on which Hindus have the tradition of performing jalabhishek on the idol of Shiva.

अखिल भारतीय हिंदू महासभा ने अपने इस आयोजन के लिए वाराणसी जिला प्राधिकरण से भी कोई अनुमति नहीं ली है और न ही उन्होंने अधिकारियों को इसकी जानकारी दी है। 

The Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha has not taken permission for this event from the Varanasi Zilla authority nor have they given any intimation to the authorities.

एबीएचएम के राष्ट्रीय कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष कमलेश तिवारी ने कहा 'हमें प्रार्थना करने के लिए किसी व्यक्ति या अथॉरिटी की अनुमति की जरूरत नहीं है। हमारे कार्यकर्ता श्रंगार गौरी मंदिर में जलाभिषेक करेंगे और ग्यानवापी इलाके को मुस्लिम मुक्त बनाने के लिए एक विरोध प्रदर्शन भी करेंगे।' 

ABHM's National Working' President Kamlesh TIwari has said, ""We don't need the permission of any person or authority to offer prayers. Our workers will perform jalabhishek at Shringar Gauri Mandir and will also conduct an agitation to make Gyanvapi Muslim-free.""  

अखिल भारतीय हिंदू महासभा साल 2017 में होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में भी उतरने की तैयारी में है। उसने संगठन से जुड़ने के लिए पदाधिकारियों के मोबाइल नंबर्स सोशल मीडिया पर भी पोस्ट किए हैं। 

The Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha is also preparing to contest the 2017 Lok Sabha Elections. They have a social media campaign on mobile to increase recruitment.

संगठन चुनावी हथकंडे के तौर पर उकसावे वाले नारों का भी इस्तेमाल कर रहा है। उसके पोस्टर्स और बैनर्स पर कुछ ऐसे ही स्लोगन छपे हैं मसलन 'चलो काशी, इस्लाम मुक्त भारत हमारी जिद है, हमारा अधिकार है, खून से तिलक करो-गोलियों से आरती, काशी विश्वनाथ में नमाज नहीं अब गूंजेगा केवल…।' 

As part of their strategy for the elections, they are also using provocative slogans. On their posters and banners they have printed slogans like, ""Onward to Kashi"" ""An Islam-Free India is Our Right"" ""Make a Tilak from Blood and Aarti from Bullets"" ""No Namaaz will be heard in Kashi"" 

वहीं पुलिस ने ऐसे किसी भी अभियान से अनभिज्ञता जताई है। काशी विश्वनाथ मंदिर के एसपी अरुण कुमार पांडे का कहना है कि मंदिर में किसी का भी प्रवेश पूरी तरह से प्रतिबंधित है और एबीएचएम को भी इसकी इजाजत बिलकुल नहीं दी जा सकती है।

The police have claimed ignorance of any such campaign. The SP of Kashi Vishwanath Mandi, Kumar Pandey, said that no one is allowed t enter the mandir, and ABHM cannot be given leave to do so.

&gt;* The plane was hijacked by the Pakistani state to bargain for the release of Maulana Masood Azhar, the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) imprisoned by India in Kashmir.

&gt;* On June 25, Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) released an interview of Adam Gadhan, the American spokesman of Al-Qaeda killed in a drone strike in Waziristan this year.

&gt;* Adnan Rasheed, a commander with the Pakistani Taliban, revealed in 2013 that as a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) staff he was sent to a JeM training camp where he realised: We are soldiers in uniform and JeM members are soldiers without uniform; we follow them and they take instruction from our institution  the ISI. Adnan also revealed that he was part of a unit in the PAF called Idarat-ul-Pakistan (the Institution of Pakistan), whose stated objective was to create a jihadist network across the Pakistani armed forces.

&gt;* The argument remains: this external force subverts the process of Indias history; Multan was a Hindu city, Lahore a Sikh metropolis.

&gt;* Actor Salman Khan, holding a torch of hope in his new movie Bajrangi Bhaijaan in which he helps a lost mute girl return home in Pakistan, tweeted that Modi and Sharif should watch the film because love for children is above all boundaries. Khan the Bajrangi is indeed the impulse of Indian civilisation; the Pakistani identity is an interim construct; the identity, the civilisational impulse, remains Indian.

From site:
वाराणसी: वाराणसी में अखिल भारतीय हिंदू महासभा ने ग्यानवापी मस्जिद के पास स्थित मंदिर में 'जलाभिषेक' के लिए देशभर से कार्यकर्ताओं को आमंत्रित किया है। 

Varanasi: Indian Hindu Mahasabha has requested volunteers to perform ""Jalabhishekh"" at Gyaanvaapi Mosque.

यहां इस तरह की धार्मिक गतिविधियां प्रतिबंधित हैं। ऐसे में माना जा रहा है कि हिंदू महासभा का ये कदम वाराणसी में माहौल को खराब कर सकता है। उल्लेखनीय है कि वाराणसी प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी का संसदीय क्षेत्र है। 

Here such kind of Dharmic rules are curbed - It is agreed that Hindu Mahasabha's such steps will destroy the peace of Varanasi.  Remarkable that Varanasi is the seat of PM Modi.

महासभा के कार्यकर्ताओं का कहना है कि उनका यह आयोजन देश को इस्लाम मुक्त बनाने के अभियान का हिस्सा है। 

Mahasabha volunteers have said that this step is first of many to free India from Islam.

जलाभिषेक के लिए 3 अगस्त का दिन चुना गया है। 3 अगस्त को ही सावन का पहला सोमवार भी है जिस दिन हिंदुओं में शिव प्रतिमा पर जलाभिषेक करने की परंपरा है। 

""Jalabhishekh""  is set for 03/August..Doing Jalabhishek on Shiva's statue on Saavan month (Hindu calendar) first Monday is customary per Hindu tradition.

अखिल भारतीय हिंदू महासभा ने अपने इस आयोजन के लिए वाराणसी जिला प्राधिकरण से भी कोई अनुमति नहीं ली है और न ही उन्होंने अधिकारियों को इसकी जानकारी दी है। 

Indian Hindu Mahasabha has not obtained permission from Varanasi Jilla administration and have not informed administration about such activity.

एबीएचएम के राष्ट्रीय कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष कमलेश तिवारी ने कहा 'हमें प्रार्थना करने के लिए किसी व्यक्ति या अथॉरिटी की अनुमति की जरूरत नहीं है। हमारे कार्यकर्ता श्रंगार गौरी मंदिर में जलाभिषेक करेंगे और ग्यानवापी इलाके को मुस्लिम मुक्त बनाने के लिए एक विरोध प्रदर्शन भी करेंगे।' 

ABHM (IHM as above)'s administrator Kamalesh Tiwari has said 'We need no permission from any authority or person. Our program is doing Jalabhishekh on Sringhar Gowri Temple and procession will be taken to free Gyaanvaapi area from Muslims'

अखिल भारतीय हिंदू महासभा साल 2017 में होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में भी उतरने की तैयारी में है। उसने संगठन से जुड़ने के लिए पदाधिकारियों के मोबाइल नंबर्स सोशल मीडिया पर भी पोस्ट किए हैं। 

IHM is ready to contest 2017 State elections. And if you wish to join them, contact their mobile # posted in Social media.

संगठन चुनावी हथकंडे के तौर पर उकसावे वाले नारों का भी इस्तेमाल कर रहा है। उसके पोस्टर्स और बैनर्स पर कुछ ऐसे ही स्लोगन छपे हैं मसलन 'चलो काशी, इस्लाम मुक्त भारत हमारी जिद है, हमारा अधिकार है, खून से तिलक करो-गोलियों से आरती, काशी विश्वनाथ में नमाज नहीं अब गूंजेगा केवल…।' 

The group is using such activities as a pre-poll gimmick. The posters and banners call out - 'Kashi- we are fixed on Muslim free India ... that's our right, and will wear blood on our forehead, bullets to welcome us, no one will offer Namaaz on Kashi vishwanath'

वहीं पुलिस ने ऐसे किसी भी अभियान से अनभिज्ञता जताई है। काशी विश्वनाथ मंदिर के एसपी अरुण कुमार पांडे का कहना है कि मंदिर में किसी का भी प्रवेश पूरी तरह से प्रतिबंधित है और एबीएचएम को भी इसकी इजाजत बिलकुल नहीं दी जा सकती है।

Again - i hope you do not give me flak for this,but these are not my views...merely observations ive made from my conversations with my muslim relatives and hindu friends who hail from different places.Not everyone i must say...but between not caring/holding extremist views among families,its the extremists who overpower the general consensus.",2015-07-31 18:01:06

It is not enough if the Centre is not corrupt, not going after the corrupt is also a form of corruption.

Saying that it is a state subject also don't cut it as the BJP now rules a sizeable chunk of states where Amit Shah's writ runs large.

Are you saying killing of those 257 is not an act of terrorism? Must be charity right?

&gt;Narendra Modi architected Godhra riots when he was CM,and later killed witnesses and dumped evidences to get a clean chit.He is a PM.So his wrong doings which killed 1000s is all forgotten but still Yakub is a terrorist.

What logic, sir ji. Who did he take revenge on? Rioters? Blowing up hundreds of innocent unrelated people punished the 1992 rioters, is that what you're saying? You think Bal Thackeray etc. were hurt by it?

The courts did justice. If they wanted your style of 'revenge' they'd order the execution of a few hundred random unrelated Muslims. Instead they stuck to Yakub and his own crimes and punished him as per our decades-old laws.

The man sitting on the border kept waiting for permission from seniors. Now, we don’t even think twice before pulling the trigger. We know Delhi is with us,” said the BSF commander. BSF DG D K Pathak too said the government is supporting the force like never before. “All the senior government including the National Security Advisor is in constant touch with us. The death of every border personnel is a personal loss.”

Double the force: Parikkar takes Modi-Doval hardline on Pak firing further After the killing of one Border Security Force jawan by the Pakistanis along the international border in Samba sector of Jammu, India’s solid retaliation has resulted in four Pakistani Rangers were reportedly killed, says an NDTV report.
This policy is part of the new Narendra Modi-Ajit Doval line of giving it back in spades if Pakistan tries to escalate tensions along the line of control or the international border.

Army razes 19 terrorist camps in PoK The army has destroyed 19 terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) while retaliating to unprovoked firing on civilians in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan forces.
This was disclosed in a report submitted to Defence Minister Arun Jaitley by General Dalbir Singh Suhag.
The report says there were more than 2,000 terrorists waiting in camps on the LoC to cross over and some of them were killed in the army action. Some of the terror camps were close to Pakistan army check posts and several of them were also damaged.

 Even as there is no official confirmation yet on the casualties suffered by NSCN(K) and other insurgent outfits in Tuesday's Army crackdown on their camps in Myanmar, intelligence reports with the home ministry indicate that at least 19 insurgents killed on Tuesday were given a soldier's farewell on Thursday, with a burial in the presence of a Buddhist religious leader.
In addition, as many as 60 injured cadres were shifted out in 12-13 vehicles to safer locations in Kalemyo, Mandalay and beyond.




&gt;http://www.dailyo.in/politics/border-tension-lets-cut-the-crap/story/1/330.html
As the lead story in today's Mail Today reports, the Pakistan establishment, fattened for years on the impression that an Indian retaliation will be token and result in no real damage, was shaken by the swiftness and intensity of the response. Nobody will confirm this for you officially, but every Pakistani shell that landed in Jammu triggered ten Indian shells smashing into Pakistan. Fire included the use of rocket-propelled grenades.
Beyond the public statements - or lack thereof - from the political establishment, there was no political diffidence within the security command structure. The message to the forces on the ground was clear. There was no hesitation. In public, the message was that Pakistan could forget about talks until its guns fell silent. On the phone and in operations rooms, it was less ambiguous: do what's necessary to make those guns fall silent; the message has to be unmistakable. As anyone will tell you, a commander on the ground values clarity from the civilian leadership as much, if not more than the trust of his forces. The BSF and Army had a sharp brief: graduate your responses, but shake the Pakistanis off their gun positions.

&gt;* A BJP lawmaker has created a controversy by demanding that Aurangzeb Road in Lutyen's Delhi be renamed after former President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday.

&gt;* An author of books on Delhi's history and monuments, Narayani Gupta said, ""This kind of mania for renaming is a lazy option.

&gt;* ""Earlier, author and former diplomat who also served as Governor, Gopal Gandhi had said, ""Renaming roads is the tribute of inertia to opportunism.

&gt;* President Kalam's memory should not be given the stale homage of an old road named anew but a new creation in fields where he was the undoubted pioneer.

&gt;* In 2014, the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee had petitioned PM Modi to change the name of Aurangzeb Road to Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib Road.Aurangzeb was the sixth Mughal Emperor who ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent in the 17th century.

&gt;* She reportedly sequestered herself in a room at the temple for almost three days and performed a special puja.Ms Raje, 62, has been under heavy opposition fire for what is being called Lalitgate - the Congress and other parties want her removed for her links with tainted cricket moghul Lalit Modi.

&gt;* They have disrupted Parliament every day of the monsoon session so far demanding that Ms Raje and two other BJP leaders caught in scandals must resign.The Ma Pitambara temple is known to be visited by politicians going through a rough patch in their lives and careers; they perform puja here hoping for divine help to get things back to normal.The Rajasthan chief minister reached the temple on July 29 and was there till the 31st, when she returned to her state.

&gt;* Sources at the temple said she spoke only to the head priest Acharya Shree Ram Panda during her stay and performed puja, reciting bhajans.On July 31, she performed the guru poornima puja on a full moon, considered auspicious in Hindu tradition.Datia is about 100 km from Gwalior, where Vasundhara Raje's family, the Scindias, are erstwhile royals.Ms Raje, who is also the chairman of the Ma Pitambara board, visited the temple twice in July.

&gt;* In the national elections held five months later, the BJP had won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

&gt;* ""I agree with Rahul that the fact that the party entertains differing views does not in itself harm us, what does us damage is the sly attempt by some to portray them as evidence of something they are not--dissidence or disloyalty,"" he said.

&gt;* He took a bullet to the head.He was wearing neither a helmet nor an Indian Army innovation called the bulletproof patka, that gives Sikh men limited protection from gunfire.Mr Singh's courage, or for that matter, the courage of the Punjab policemen around him cannot take away from the fact that guts alone cannot defeat highly trained terrorists armed to the gills.Elsewhere, some policemen of the Punjab police wearing neither helmets not bullet proof vests engaged the terrorists with primitive Self-Loading Rifles (SLRs), which was no match for the firepower of the enemy's AK-47s.

&gt;* When the Punjab Police's Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams arrived, they were seen rushing to take up positions wearing their knee pads.

&gt;* ""According to some estimates, there is a standing requirement of at least 50,000 bullet proof kits in India's police forces but there is never a clear indicator since individual states handle their own law and order decisions and rarely spell out a requirement until they finally come out with a tender.But the problems begin when the acquisition process starts.

&gt;* Vendors looking to sell to police forces have serious questions with the evaluation process and often have to wait indefinitely for answers to queries they may have.

&gt;* In the case of companies like MKU, not only are they manufacturing in India, they are exporting their equipment to highly discerning foreign customers while looking to expand their footprint across the globe.For the policeman or policewoman on the ground, the more things change, the more they remain the same.

330,"&gt; You mean the #Modi56inchrocks thing?

No, I mean the #SFRaidIntoMyanmarThatDestroyedTwoCampsAndLeftDozensOfTerroristsDead thing. See, I tend to look at action on the ground. Others choose to ignore that and would rather focus on what a junior minister had to say on a social media platform. That's their choice, I suppose.

&gt;It's almost as if you believe that Modiji created the Indian defense forces. They have existed for ages and they work the same as before.

I don't think you understand. The armed forces are just a tool. They do not act without political direction, at least not in India. You could have the best armed fores in the world, but it would amount to zilch if you kept them confined to their barracks when the country was facing armed coercion. So while Modi didn't ""create"" the defence forces, he did decide to utilise them properly, to have them to the job they were meant to do. The credit for that goes to his government.

&gt;They have existed for ages and they work the same as before.

Disagree. If you happen to speak to some of the soldiers and officers who were deployed along to LoC in 2013, when the Pakistanis escalated their artillery strikes and BAT raids, they'll tell you how they came under pressure to act *very* defensively; to endure the attacks without retaliating strongly.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today favoured raising sugar exports to liquidate surplus stocks because of low domestic demand that has led to a huge cane arrears of over Rs 14,000 crore to farmers.Modi chaired a meeting of ministers and officials to review issues related to the sugar sector where he called for increasing the ethanol-blending with petrol.

&gt; * ""Taking note of the current supply-demand issues with regard to sugar, the Prime Minister called for assiduous efforts to increase ethanol blending of fuel.

&gt; * He also called for exploring all possibilities for export of sugar,"" a PMO statement said after the meeting.Sugar industry, which owes about Rs 14,398 crore to cane farmers , is unable to make payment as it is facing severe liquidity crunch on account of surplus production that has resulted in low prices of sugar in the domestic market.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh , Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , among others, participated in the meeting.

&gt; * According to sources, the Prime Minister stressed on increasing mandatory ethanol blending with petrol to 10 per cent in the long run from the existing five per cent blending.This will result in increase in ethanol production to 230 crore litre from the current 115 crore litres and will absorb surplus sugar of at least 3-4 million tonnes, they added.The meeting also discussed about ways to increase pulses production and reduce the country's dependence on imports.

&gt;* Maliwal shot off two letters to Bassi taking note of increasing crime rates against women, and asking for the status of safety measures.

&gt;* The catalysts for her actions seem to be the recent horrific, public murder of a 19 year old girl in Delhi's Anand Parbat area, which went ripples of outrage and shock through the city, and the latest data by the National Crime Records Bureau that, according to Maliwal's letter shows five cases of rape and twelve cases of molestation of women in Delhi, everyday.

&gt;* This extensive data is purportedly for a comprehensive study on the status of such crimes in Delhi, one of the tasks Maliwal had promised to undertake upon her appointment.

&gt;* It remains to be seen how cooperative the Delhi police is in this exercise, given the history of animosity between Bassi's force and any arm of the AAP led government, where both parties have sought to undermine and undo the other's work.

&gt; * The latest attack should be a wakeup call to fortify our defences in these states too, especially Gujarat which is Modi's home state and bull's eye for jihadists.The political message from the Pakistani terrorists who raided a police station in Gurdaspur and fought for 11 hours is that Kashmir is not the only bone of contention.Islamist extremists treat India as a whole as Dar-al-Kufr or Dar-al-Harb (land of infidels or land of war), which must be recovered back into the Islamic fold of medieval times through the force of gun.Cliches that the Gurdaspur attack was meant to derail peace talks between India and Pakistan miss the ideological motives that drive the terrorists and their handlers in the Pakistani military , who do not believe in compromise or negotiation with kafirs (infidels).Complacency following a relative decline in infiltration and shootings outside J&amp;K in recent times has been shattered by the Gurdaspur attack, which is an omen of the war returning to haunt India.Therefore, the levels of vigilance have to be switched back on not just the 2,900-km-long international border but in all populated urban centres.The Gurdaspur attack was notable for the autonomy exercised by the Punjab police's Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT) team, which refused the assistance of the Indian Army and the National Security Guard.

&gt; * The Modi government's preference for decentralised counter-terrorism was on display as Punjab's top cop was in constant touch with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.Yet, as veterans of counter-terrorism like KPS Gill have argued, the capacity of our state police forces to tackle hardened and sophisticated terrorists has fallen considerably.

&gt; * After Gurdaspur, Modi's desire to deepen the strategic cooperation with Israel (he will be the first Indian PM to visit that country) makes even more eminent sense.Besides Israel, India must enter a deeper intelligence alliance with Afghanistan and Iran  countries that border Pakistan and which are also at the receiving end of Pakistan-sponsored Sunni jihadists.The anti-India 'Punjabi Taliban' and Punjab-centred jihadist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are networked with the Pashtun Taliban , Al Qaeda and, of late, with the Islamic State (ISIS), which are motivated by hatred of the Afghan and Iranian governments.A trilateral counter-terrorism front involving Afghanistan, Iran and India should be a key objective of Modi's foreign policy, particularly in the context of a recently discovered ISIS roadmap to unite varied strands of jihadists in south Asia and launch a war in India leading to ""apocalyptic confrontation"" with the US.Such a trilateral front is easier prescribed than achieved, given that Iran and Afghanistan often diverge strategically, and also because Israel and Iran are sworn enemies.

&gt; * Yet, unifying all these anti-jihadist players is the only long-term preventive and pre-emptive option.The Modi government's ambitious objective should be to offensively break up terrorists before they enter India.For that to happen, a regional alliance that monitors and warns member countries about the stew cooking in Pakistan, and then coordinates to sabotage it, is indispensable.

&gt; Free tablets were distributed to 500 students invited from across India to the event. The government will be providing subsidies to students to bring the cost down to about **$35.**

&gt; The tablet, which has a seven-inch touch screen and 256 megabytes of RAM, will use the Android 2.2 operating system from Google and has two USB ports.

&gt; The Indian government pledged in 2009 that it would introduce a super-cheap laptop in order to **improve the quality of education** in the country through technology. Since then the project has been hit by delays and snags – critics called a first prototype **“nothing more than a souped-up USB memory stick.”**

Contrast this with the fact that the Sena's tablet initiative is with a very specific goal in mind - enable reduction in weight of schoolbags by transferring educational content from textbooks to tablets:

&gt; These tablets, manufactured by Mumbai-based e-learning company, will store all the text in one place, use audio-visual content and animation to help students retain information. Each chapter in the tablet will end with some tests for students and would help parents note progress of their wards. The development came a day after the Bombay High Court dwelled on the subject of heavy school bags causing ailments in children. A panel appointed by the State submitted its findings before a division Bench of Justices V.M. Kanade and B.P. Colabawala.

&gt; The 12-page report pointed out that 58 per cent of students below 10 years of age suffer from orthopaedic ailments caused by heavy school bags.

&gt; Only Maharashtra shines in North Central India, due to its proximity with a Southern Model (I named it).

Please elaborate. By 'southern model', were you referring to the racial/cultural angle?


&gt; We did an analysis of revenue. We did not analyse Politics and its relation to Revenue. 

And still, revenue does remain ultimately linked to politics, right?

Also, please elaborate on variations in indirect taxes across the nation. Once I came across a map of India showing the statewise differences in indirect taxes paid and Maharashtra was right on top of the list related to that map.


&gt; Do you think a honest effort by these Bhakts to reconcile with their Pakistani cousins wont bring peace and trade?

Are you saying Pakistan is 'their' issue, and not of us south of the Vindhyas?


&gt; Become a Federation Modeled behind the US with increased state powers.States will pay Tax to the Center based on representation,Not on Individual Income ( I NEED COMMENTS ON THIS). and for common needs like Railways, Airways, Military, Common Infrastructure - Not for anything else.

Don't the southern states lose out on representation as well? Also, if a small section of the polulation (trader communities) could control affairs in much of northern Indian society, why can the numerically lesser Dravidas not do the same on an all-India level?


Also, with greater devolution of taxes to states, isn't Modi honestly on a similar path?


&gt; Dravida consistently outshine the Indo Aryans in all socio economic indexes.North India continues to be backward as it was for 3000 years.

Honestly, haven't the frontier Indo-Aryans defended us from the bloodthirsty hoardes of barbarians and absorbed much of the shock that otherwise would have hit the peninsula real hard?",2015-08-02 13:09:26
366,"Islamist extremists treat India as Dar-al-Kufr or Dar-al-Harb (land of infidels or land of war) that must be taken back into the Islamic fold.

---

&gt; * The latest attack should be a wakeup call to fortify our defences in these states too, especially Gujarat which is Modi's home state and bull's eye for jihadists.The political message from the Pakistani terrorists who raided a police station in Gurdaspur and fought for 11 hours is that Kashmir is not the only bone of contention.Islamist extremists treat India as a whole as Dar-al-Kufr or Dar-al-Harb (land of infidels or land of war), which must be recovered back into the Islamic fold of medieval times through the force of gun.Cliches that the Gurdaspur attack was meant to derail peace talks between India and Pakistan miss the ideological motives that drive the terrorists and their handlers in the Pakistani military , who do not believe in compromise or negotiation with kafirs (infidels).Complacency following a relative decline in infiltration and shootings outside J&amp;K in recent times has been shattered by the Gurdaspur attack, which is an omen of the war returning to haunt India.Therefore, the levels of vigilance have to be switched back on not just the 2,900-km-long international border but in all populated urban centres.The Gurdaspur attack was notable for the autonomy exercised by the Punjab police's Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT) team, which refused the assistance of the Indian Army and the National Security Guard.

&gt; * The Modi government's preference for decentralised counter-terrorism was on display as Punjab's top cop was in constant touch with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.Yet, as veterans of counter-terrorism like KPS Gill have argued, the capacity of our state police forces to tackle hardened and sophisticated terrorists has fallen considerably.

&gt; * After Gurdaspur, Modi's desire to deepen the strategic cooperation with Israel (he will be the first Indian PM to visit that country) makes even more eminent sense.Besides Israel, India must enter a deeper intelligence alliance with Afghanistan and Iran  countries that border Pakistan and which are also at the receiving end of Pakistan-sponsored Sunni jihadists.The anti-India 'Punjabi Taliban' and Punjab-centred jihadist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are networked with the Pashtun Taliban , Al Qaeda and, of late, with the Islamic State (ISIS), which are motivated by hatred of the Afghan and Iranian governments.A trilateral counter-terrorism front involving Afghanistan, Iran and India should be a key objective of Modi's foreign policy, particularly in the context of a recently discovered ISIS roadmap to unite varied strands of jihadists in south Asia and launch a war in India leading to ""apocalyptic confrontation"" with the US.Such a trilateral front is easier prescribed than achieved, given that Iran and Afghanistan often diverge strategically, and also because Israel and Iran are sworn enemies.

&gt; * Yet, unifying all these anti-jihadist players is the only long-term preventive and pre-emptive option.The Modi government's ambitious objective should be to offensively break up terrorists before they enter India.For that to happen, a regional alliance that monitors and warns member countries about the stew cooking in Pakistan, and then coordinates to sabotage it, is indispensable.

b) Modi tried his level best to stop violence. He called in army within 48 hours of violence starting ( basically as soon as possible). Even 1000 troops were called from Punjab  Police within a few days, so that they could help in law and order. and be neutral.

c) The violence went on for many months, not just a few days. And Both hindus and muslims were killed in the post-godhra riots. 

d) Muslims are 10% of gujarat population. But the number of hindus killed in violence was 25% of all killed ( 200 hindus killed vs 800 muslims killed). Now who killed those 200 hindus in riots? modi too? No. they were mostly killed by Muslim rioters. That now should once and for all explain ""action and reaction"".

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Did the government appoint actor Gajendra Chauhan chief of the prestigious Film and Television Institute of India on the basis of a single-para CV with only notable achievement being the role of Yudhisthir in B R Chopra's TV serial Mahabharat?It would seem so if one goes by the copy of a file noting received from the Information and Broadcasting Ministry in response to an RTI query.

&gt; * ""Gajendra Chauhan is an actor who is best known for his portrayal of the eldest Pandava 'Yudhishthira' in the Mahabharat (TV series).

&gt; * He has worked in around 150 movies and over 600 TV serials,"" the noting said.The applicant had sought information about educational and professional qualifications of Gajendra Chauhan which were considered for his selection as President, Film and Television Institute of India, among other queries.Chauhan, with old BJP links, has been appointed President of FTII Society and Chairman of its Governing Council by the NDA government.The 281-page record provided by the Ministry includes detailed resume of other stalwarts once proposed for FTII Presidentship, but the only reference to Chauhan's qualification is a one paragraph summary.The file notings related to appointment of Chauhan show that many stalwarts of Indian cinema including Amitabh Bachchan Rajinikanth , Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Jahnu Baruah, Raju Hirani, Jaya Bachchan , Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ramesh Sippy, Govind Nihalani and Aamir Khan were considered for the post earlier.These names were proposed by the FTII for the post of President in 2014, the notings received under the Right to Information Act show.Apart from the single paragraph file noting, which spoke of Chauhan's portrayal of Yudhishthir and the number of films and serials he has acted in, the Ministry did not provide any details of his body of work or his CV that were considered ahead of his appointment as FTII chief.Though the applicant had also sought copies of all the reasons recorded for Chauhan's selection, the information provided by the Ministry does not show any reasons in defence of his controversial appointment as the FTII President.

&gt; * The Ministry was also silent on why he was preferred above the doyens of Indian cinema whose names were once proposed by FTII for appointment as its chief.Several eminent actors including Anupam Kher Salman Khan among others have come out in support of the agitating students of FTII and openly opposed Chauhan's appointment.The students, who have paralysed the functioning of the prestigious institute for over 40 days now, have also received support from Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav who have visited the campus.However, the Narendra Modi government has stuck to its guns and refused to remove Chauhan.FTII students' association (FSA) has declared that the strike will continue till their main demand for removal of Chauhan, who they allege lacks vision and stature to head the institution, and reconstitution of FTII Society is accepted.

---

&gt;* His two-room apartment in a run-down township is a far cry from Chand Pandita's hometown of Anantnag, 150 miles away, in the disputed territory of Kashmir, where pristine agricultural fields spread to the horizon.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi's conservative government, which has close ties to Hindu nationalist groups and has championed the Pandits' cause, has proposed resettling them in dedicated townships in the portion of Kashmir that India controls, which Indians refer to as the valley.

&gt;* Most of the estimated 60,000 Pandit families that fled their homes have sold their property in the valley, which is predominantly Muslim and, although under Indian control, claimed in its entirety by India and rival Pakistan.

&gt;* An Islamist uprising against Indian control in the late 1980s put the Hindu minority under siege, and one night in January 1990, with extremist Muslim leaders egging them on, militants killed more than 700 Pandits, destroyed countless homes and accelerated the flight of Hindus.

&gt;* But a little more than a year after Modi raised hope of a rapprochement with Pakistan by inviting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration in New Delhi, there has been scant progress on the many political and economic issues dividing the nuclear-armed neighbors.

407,"Congress Hits Back at Union Minister Mahesh Sharma's 'No Work, No Pay' Remark

---

&gt;* Congress today hit back at Union Minister Mahesh Sharma for his suggestion of 'no work, no pay' policy over logjam in Parliament, saying such views were ""wrong"" as Congress MPs were ""working hard"".

&gt;* MPs are working hard,"" Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh told reporters, when asked about it.Mr Sharma had yesterday said in Varanasi that there is a suggestion for applying 'no work, no pay' policy on MPs like it is being done with regard to bureaucrats, triggering a debate after which he went into a denial mode.In its reaction, BJP today said there was no such proposal before the government but the government would not mind discussing the issue.

&gt;* ""Government would not mind discussion on 'no work no pay' issue.

&gt;* But as of now there is no such matter before the government,"" Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters in New Delhi.Blaming the BJP-led government for ongoing logjam in Parliament, Ramesh said there has been no change in their stand of ""no resignation, no discussion"".The party, which is cornering the government on the Lalit Modi and Vyapam controversies, is demanding the resignation of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

&gt;* ""Questions were raised for how may days we can run it (our demand) but from day one we are saying resignation first and discussion later,"" he added.Talking about Congress Parliamentary Party meeting tomorrow morning, he said the party's stand would become clear in the speech of Mrs Sonia Gandhi.He reminded of the stand taken by BJP five years ago when they said Parliamentary disruption is a ""legitimate tactic"".

408,"Bro, if you were following the news recently, you would know the govt. has blocked the release of a report which was made by the govt. and UNICEF. Evidence points to the fact that it shows the pitfalls of the Gujarat model, if there is such a thing.

Read:

http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21656709-government-withholds-report-nutrition-contains-valuable-lessons-secrecy-and

&gt;Coincidentally or otherwise, states run in the past decade by Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appear to be laggards compared with several states that are (or were) under the control of rivals. The most sensitive example is Gujarat, which Mr Modi has touted as a model because incomes there are high. The RSOC shows that the proportion of hungry children in the state fell from 44.6% to 33.5%, but that remains worse than the national average. Maharashtra next door has similar incomes and has fared much better. Gujarat is also worse than average for stunting (42%), severe stunting (18.5%) and wasting (18.7%). Nearly two-fifths of its population defecate out of doors.",2015-08-02 20:36:24
409,"The problem is that we, as a people, are incredibly short sighted. Everyone wants a huge transformation and NOW. People think in black and white. No one realizes that to get things done lots of compromises are needed - be it corruption, supporting minor criminals or agendas. All you can do is elect the best out of the shady as we ourselves are pretty corrupt.

Even though I fully support Modi I do not think he will live up to everyone's expectations and like the Vajpayee government won't be reelected but will bring significant reforms.",2015-08-02 20:39:06
410,"I dont see anything significant happening for the next 1-2 years happening. They will wake up during the last 1-1.5 years before elections and speed up everything. Modi had promised big things for Mumbai but there still wont be any metro construction happening in the next 2 years. All during elections. 

As far as Digital India is concerned, that is one thing i see happening in reality right now and can only go upwards or fail magnificently. Smart Cities project sadly is all talk right now and nothing is actually happening (if it is, i dont know). This along with the Start Up boom should help Digital India initiatives. 

Cleanliness initiatives deserve applaud. Especially efforts taken by Suresh Prabhu, Railway Minister. He is doing a fascinating job of it as far as cleanliness on the railways is concerned. Still many many many miles to go. 

Make in India deserves applause. That's what we need right now. Even though nothing on ground has happened yet, companies pledging billions of dollars worth of investment is enough to exude confidence in the Indian Economy for foreign investors.

No hope from Prakash Javadekar (Environment) and Smriti Irani (Education). These two need to be sacked and someone really competent and strong needs to be there. Education sector needs big bang reforms and not Indian Culture education. I really doubt Smriti can pull that off. 

We all know what Gadkari is capable of and he has been effective to a certain extent. I hope he pushes modernisation and upgradation of key highways like the whole Mumbai - Pune - Nagpur highways. They are really in bad shape. 

Travel and Tourism is doing good enough. I liked the efforts taken there wrt tourist visas for everyone. 

Overall, i think Modi will manage a 2nd term as PM but not with the same numbers as last time. I really really have high expectations from him but not from his party. ",2015-08-02 21:29:57

&gt;* The biggest outwardly feature of Naidus first year has been his keen rivalry with Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhara Rao, better known as KCR, whom he tried to match, instead of realising the circumstantial differences.

&gt;* If Naidu read the contrast in mandates won by his Telugu Desam Party and his rival Telangana Rashtra Samithi's mood of victory right, he would have kept away from any chest-thumping.

&gt;* Instead, Naidu tried to focus on outdoing KCR, who once served as a minister in Naidus cabinet before he formed TRS and started a successful campaign for a separate Telangana from Andhra Pradesh.

&gt;* Stuck between an unobliging Modi, a needless face-off with Telangana government and a belligerent opposition leader YS Jaganmohan Reddy back home, Naidu had little space to manoeuvre.

&gt;* In both cases, Telangana came back with a bounty  KTR returned with a solid investment offer from Google to build their largest campus outside the USA in Hyderabad, the best Lokesh managed was a selfie with Obama.

&gt; * Notwithstanding the tall development and financial management claims of the state, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)'s five audit reports on the last leg of Narendra Modi's rule as the Gujarat Chief Minister have fished out disputed transactions worth Rs 25,000 crore, which point to fiscal profligacy and a rising debt burden.

&gt; * Among several other things, the CAG has questioned the Gujarat government's claim of a Rs 5,570 crore revenue surplus during 2012-13 and described it as overstated.

&gt; * The CAG report states: ""The Gujarat government wrongly booked expenditure of Rs 881 crore on account of grant-in-aid and expenditure of Rs 202.27 crore on subsidy resulting in overstatement of revenue surplus to the tune of Rs 1088.57 crore"".

456,"Modi Gave Incorrect Poll Expenses: Plea in HC

---

&gt;* NEW DELHI: A petition has been moved in the Delhi High Court by a former Congress MP alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave an ""incorrect account"" of his poll expenditure in Varanasi during 2014 Lok Sabha elections and has sought his disqualification as an MP.

&gt;* In his petition, Rajesh Mishra has alleged that the poll panel has been sitting on the complaint made by him against Modi as he is the Prime Minister (PM).

&gt;* He has said in his plea that while Modi's poll expenses return filed with the district electoral office, Varanasi, showed his total expenditure to be around Rs 37 lakh only, the actual figure was ""far beyond the prescribed maximum limit of Rs 70 lakh"".

&gt;* According to the petition, which has been filed by Mishra and another Congress leader from Varanasi--Prajapati Nath--the complaint was sent to the EC on June 2 this year, but till date no action has been taken.

&gt;* In their petition, the Congress leaders have also contended that Modi was required to maintain and lodge true and correct statement of the account of his election expenditure.

&gt;* ""Modi, who earlier boasted of rooting out corruption, is now silent over a series of corruption cases, including Vyapam, and charges against four Deviyan (a reference to Vasundhara Raje, Sushma Swaraj, Pankaja Munde and Smriti Irani), which has resulted in an unprecedented logjam in Parliament,"" the Rajya Sabha MP maintained.

&gt;* If the Government acts on what we have been suggesting (drop BJP Ministers facing charges), Parliament will function without any hindrance,"" he said.Mr Yechury said that he got a call to attend an all-party meet convened by the BJP-led Government to break the deadlock in Parliament, but was not specifically told about its agenda.Social activist Teesta Setalvad shared the dais with CPI(M) leaders at the rally.Later, speaking to reporters, Mr Yechury accused the NDA Government of ""selectively"" taking up mercy petitions of death row convicts.

&gt;* But there can't be two parameters for delivering justice,"" said Mr Yechury.The CPI(M) leader was here to launch a 14-day long protest organised by his party in the BJP-ruled states.

&gt;* He accused the BJP governments of being ""anti-poor"", ""anti- farmers"" and ""anti-adivasis"".Accusing the Modi government of practising ""crony capitalism"", the CPM leader said its economic policies have proved ""disastrous"" and aggravated the agrarian distress, leading to a significant rise in number of farmer suicides.The Manmohan Singh government's economic policies were ""bad"", but those followed by the Modi administration were ""worse"", the Communist leader said.

&gt; [New York Manhole Covers, Forged Barefoot in India](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/nyregion/26manhole.html?_r=0)

&gt; Seemingly impervious to the heat from the metal, the workers at one of West Bengal’s many foundries relied on strength and bare hands rather than machinery. Safety precautions were barely in evidence; just a few pairs of eye goggles were seen in use on a recent visit. The foundry, Shakti Industries in Haora, produces manhole covers for Con Edison and New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection, as well as for departments in New Orleans and Syracuse.

&gt; The scene was as spectacular as it was anachronistic: flames, sweat and liquid iron mixing in the smoke like something from the Middle Ages. That’s what attracted the interest of a photographer who often works for The New York Times — images that practically radiate heat and illustrate where New York’s manhole covers are born.

&gt; The temperature outside the factory yard was more than 100 degrees on a September visit. Several feet from where the metal was being poured, the area felt like an oven, and the workers were slick with sweat.

&gt; Often, sparks flew from pots of the molten metal. In one instance they ignited a worker’s lungi, a skirtlike cloth wrap that is common men’s wear in India. He quickly, reflexively, doused the flames by rubbing the burning part of the cloth against the rest of it with his hand, then continued to cart the metal to a nearby mold.

&gt; “We can’t maintain the luxury of Europe and the United States, with all the boots and all that,” said Sunil Modi, director of Shakti Industries. He said, however, that the foundry never had accidents. He was concerned about the attention, afraid that contracts would be pulled and jobs lost.

&gt; * The plan is to expand the direct cash transfer scheme, by deducting a portion of the subsidy each family receives through various government welfare schemes and putting an equivalent amount of cash in the account of the beneficiary.To begin with, it will pay 5% of the total subsidy in cash, said a senior government official who is part of the deliberations on the matter.

&gt; * A pilot programme is likely to be launched within a month.Many consumers already get cooking gas subsidy directly in their bank accounts as part of the Centre's efforts to plug leakages in its welfare programmes.The latest proposal is aimed at deepening financial inclusion by offering a basic income to the poor consumer that she can decide where to spend, thereby boosting demand in an economy where the signs of growth are still feeble.Authorities are still working on a mechanism to decide the quantum of income to be transferred to each family.

&gt; * If it is distributed among only the poor, each could get well over Rs 2,000, assuming that 40% of the households are poor.Since subsidies are prone to leakage, direct transfer will ensure better delivery and efficiency gains will be more than when the subsidies are given through other means.Analysts said the government's intention was good, but they were unsure how it would implement the scheme.

&gt; * The pilot will be launched in 10% of the 300-odd food surplus districts in the country using the Aadhaar database, the government official said.Using the Aadhaar database could cause hiccups when the scheme is launched nationwide, as Aadhaar still doesn't cover the entire population and the SC has ordered that it shouldn't be insisted upon to offer state support.NC Saxena, a former member of the now-defunct Planning Commission , said he didn't want subsidy transfer to substitute government support in providing public goods such as health and education.

This is just the first step for them to impose a slow, methodical rule over the internet where free thought against the Modi regime is suppressed. I guarantee it.",2015-08-03 15:13:46
488,"Fuck. These guys went the whole 9 yards with this shit. In the name of 'morality' and 'decency'..right.

For fucks sake your MLA's were caught watching porn in the fucking assembly. We have brought this upon ourselves people, when we foolishly got lured by all the sweet talk of development and sound economic policy and all the shit that Modi shined and called gold.We gave him the power to do this, served hot on a platter.That motherfucker! What a fucking farce!

All they've done since coming to power is ban this and ban that and the sheer number of people on Facebook and twitter defending all this! Fucking illiterate cunts 'empowered' by the internet. The sheep following their shepherd to the slaughter. heres to even more radical policies in the future, because I dont see these 'Hindu terrorists' going out of power any time soon.

FUCK THE BJP. I'll vote for a guy with fucking down syndrome before I ever give these cunts a vote.",2015-08-03 15:20:43

490,"The best indication of Modi the PM was Modi the CM. Even in Modi's Gujarat, culturally things were never rosy. Add to that the fact that he made a deal with RSS that when he comes to power RSS will dictate the cultural agenda of the govt while he will control the rest.

I was thinking RSS will try to control education, maybe bollywood but the amount of influence they are having has surprised me completely. Now I am actually afraid that meat, alcohol, western music, western movies and all ""foreign"" influences will be curtailed.

Fringes are filled with shit. Right wing, left wing, muslim, hindu doesn't matter. When fringes dictate policy the country goes to shit.",2015-08-03 15:43:08
491,"I remember these were the kind of headlines I'd read about Gujarat when Modi was CM.

But these days the internet liberals love to rewrite recent history by claiming (with negative proof) the media always supported Modi.",2015-08-03 15:48:28
492,"&gt; Things like this are exactly what i feared when Modi government came to power.

A party which originated out of a nationalist right wing outfit can never be trusted. At least aap and congress don't enshrine communalism and hindu orthodoxy in their party platform. Yes, they are corrupt too, but you at least won't have to deal with having your porn being banned.",2015-08-03 15:52:04
