4,"That Lalit Modi is linked to politicians in every major party is something no one wants to discuss - since it does not help put the BJP and PM Modi is the dock.

---

&gt; * Much nuance, even commonsense, is being sacrificed in the way Narendra Modi's political opponents and even the media are dealing with the fallout of the Lalit Modi affair.

&gt; * The unstated goal is to use Lalit Modi to embarrass the PM, and this is why no one wants to talk about all of Lalit Modi's other linkages.

&gt; * Two, he has not acted against Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje - especially after a document surfaced bearing her signature backing Lalit Modi's residency in the UK - and there is some evidence that Lalit Modi invested in the shares of Raje's son's company at inflated prices.

&gt; * Prima facie, putting the allegations in perspective, this is what seems plausible: Sushma Swaraj seems to be guilty of an impropriety in helping Lalit Modi; Smriti Irani told the Election Commission a lie about her BCom degree in 2004 but has now corrected herself; and Raje seems likely to be in the dock for questionable dealings involving her son, not to speak of helping Lalit Modi in the UK.

5,Can somebody explain What wrong fucking thing Lalit Modi did ?? other than his fallout with Shashi Tharoor.,2015-06-26 01:33:16
6,"&gt;You can be pedantic and say people voted for an idea, but who would fulfill that idea? BJP? No, I think Modi. That's what it was made to be.

Where does one draw the line between voting for an individual vs voting for an individual projected as the most able executor of a certain vision? To me, the distinction is *very* subjective, and often depends on which political party/individual one supports.

As someone who supported the BJP this election, I feel that the party projected Modi as the face of an idea; as the best person to convert that idea to reality. This was backed up by his record in Gujarat. The message I got was: the vision is what is important, the individual is secondary. The slogan adopted was ""*acche din*"", while ""*har har Modi*"" was actively discouraged. A detractor could still argue that people only voted for Modi the person instead of his vision, and while I would disagree, I admit that I wouldn't be able to prove him wrong beyond all doubt.

This applies to the AAP in the Delhi elections as well.

On the other hand, I don't how the person who was most likely to become the PM had the Congress won a majority -- Rahul Gandhi -- represented any sort of vision. The public was expected to vote for him because he was a Gandhi. Period. he did not rise up through the ranks of the party like some others (Pranab Mukherjee, AK Antony, Sushilkumar Shinde, etc.) did. He had no solid record of achievements to speak of. The Congress' election machine, then, was the classic personality cult.

So I don't see how Amit Shah's statement is ""the exact opposite of 2014"". It looks consistent with the way the BJP's 2014 election campaign was run, and is more of a pot-shot at Sonia/Rahul/Priyanka Gandhi.",2015-06-26 02:43:17

&gt; * China's move to block sanctions on Pakistan for harbouring the notorious terrorist mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is the latest manifestation of the growing strength of the Beijing-Islamabad axis.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has made strengthening Pakistan's 60-year-old alliance with China a top priority.

&gt; * Even before the war, Indian intelligence had indications that then Pakistani military dictator Field Marshall Ayub Khan was secretly reaching out to Beijing because of Khan's failing faith in the US.During the 1962 war, President John F Kennedy's greatest worry was that Pakistan would launch a second front and attack in Kashmir while India was fighting China in the Himalayas.Shortly after the war, Pakistan and China settled their border dispute in Kashmir, setting the stage for what is now the track of the economic corridor from Kashgar to Gwadar.

&gt; * Prime minister Modi reportedly opposed the economic corridor when he visited China in May, although he limited his opposition to the passage and projects through Kashmir, which is, of course, crucial to the whole project.Like India's protests against the Chinese veto protecting Lakhvi, the opposition to the economic corridor is ineffectual.

&gt; * China ignores India's protests.

&gt;* ""There is nobody who is tainted please,"" Mr Jaitley said at the Delhi airport.The party, sources have told NDTV, will back the Rajasthan Chief Minister, who is caught in a political storm over supporting disgraced cricket tycoon Lalit Modi's immigration appeal to UK in 2011.

&gt;* The sources pointed out that there is no charge of financial corruption against Ms Raje.Another senior union minister Venkaiah Naidu said, ""As far as party is concerned, everything is happening positively.

&gt;* ""In defence of Ms Raje, a powerful regional leader, top government sources denied the Congress charge that she helped a ""fugitive"" in Lalit Modi.

&gt;* ""That is how, with the help of a court order, he can be brought back to India to face the legal system,"" the BJP leader said.Another party leader pointed out that the strongest indictment against Lalit Modi came from a committee of India's cricket board headed by the BJP's Arun Jaitley.Earlier on Thursday, a press release from Ms Raje's office said she had not been asked by the party to resign.

27,"Vasundhara Raje's Defense to Cite Legal Technicality

---

&gt;* To justify that top BJP leader Vasundhara Raje does not need to resign as Rajasthan Chief Minister, the party is likely to present an argument from her legal team that she changed her mind at the last minute about backing the immigration appeal of disgraced cricket magnate Lalit Modi.

&gt;* ""No minister is tainted, please,"" said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley last night, indicating his party continues to back the beleaguered Ms Raje.In 2011, she signed a statement declaring the vast investigation against Mr Modi was ""politically motivated"" - the affidavit, provided to a UK court, was leaked this week, enabling the opposition Congress to amplify calls for her resignation for supporting a man wanted in multiple criminal cases in India.

&gt;* Without her deposition, the incriminating affidavit amounts to only ""a propose witness statement... intent, but not action"", say sources who are weighing the merits of this line of defence.

&gt;* Ms Raje has also raised the issue of other politicians and 'VIPS"" whose names have not yet come into the public domain who testified in favour of Lalit Modi, asking why the focus is on her alone.BJP sources say that the party will also underscore that Ms Raje cannot be faulted for financial transgressions.But arguments like those are unlikely to tamp down the political controversy, something the BJP concedes privately.

&gt;* Earlier this month, she said she was unaware of the document after Mr Modi outed it in a television interview.For the BJP, Ms Raje's status as an immensely powerful regional leader adds to the trickiness of how and whether to take any action against her.

An article for you to read.

&gt;*Ahmedabad on a fast track to urbanisation*

*Netscribes / Anupama Chandra*
*February 21, 2005*


&gt;Ahmedabad seems to be taking the fact that 2005 has been nominated as the ‘urban development year’ very seriously. Currently listed among the ten largest cities in India, Ahmedabad is seeking to effect major developmental initiatives in order to overhaul its infrastructural facilities so as to keep pace with the ongoing expansion in urban settlements.

&gt;Industry experts opine that most areas connected with the Ring Road would be the new popular destinations once the city achieves its urbanisation targets. Sola Road, Vadaj, **Ghatlodia**, **Chandlodia** and Gandhinagar shall soon become residential hotspots. The areas beyond Bopal, Thaltej and the SG Highway are deemed good for housing complexes, while Gandhinagar, Shela, in South Bopal, and Ghuma, beyond Bopal, are preferred for bungalow schemes.

&gt;The factor that would propel this process is the excellent connectivity enjoyed by these places. So, these passé suburbs will soon see much-needed attention coming their way. This urbanisation process is most likely to lead to the gradual merging of Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad, with only about 35-40 sq km area between the SG Highway and 200 ft Ring Road requiring to be filled.

&gt;It is believed that almost 50 per cent of the state’s population is likely migrate to urban areas over the next 10 years. Since adequate planning and management will be required to manage the inflow of such vast numbers, it will help if the current development of Ahmedabad is seen as a preparation to this end and done in a way that will stand the city in good stead in the long run.*",2015-06-26 17:10:17

In fact the Prahlad Nagar roads were build just 4 months ago before that they were completly destroyed for 6 months because of last years monsoon. Only reason AUDA did anything is because of the Gujarat summit.

I wanted a non congress, non third front government and i got one. I wanted AAP to succeed in Delhi because i think, and i still do, that this nation needed a left of center party that would be non congress and wont have the historical baggage of the congress and its Gandhi centric leadership or a third front government which has no ideological  glue to hold it together and consisting of opportunists who have neither the moral or intellectual weight to inspire any confidence. 

Both parties have fallen short of what they promised. 

Modi was undone by his partymen who have carried on as if its business as usual. PR people in his party seem to have asked him to keep quiet while people like Rajnath Singh and Jaitely field the questions and the mudslinging thinking that none of the mud would stick to Modi's persona. A few weeks from now a stern statement from the PMO will be forthcoming i think and the supporters will say ""look he has spoken and warned people in his party that this wont do"". Unfortunately, this mud will stick and people will remember the period of silence rather than the statement. Modi needs to be statesman like within and without the country a fact that seems lost on him.

On the land acquisition bill amendment I agreed with government and was sorry to see them backtrack. I would have hoped they showed more backbone. 

The way in which the standoff with the delhi government was engineered, which is evident to any non partisan observer also left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Enough about BJP for the moment, AAP was no better

They violated the trust that people had in them by actively courting  people from BJP and congress, often they were other than moral, upstanding people. 

The schism that happened in the party and the dirty airing of their laundry in public meant they could not even keep their house in order and could not drive consensus. The method in which the dissidents were thrown out of the party left a bad taste in my mouth atleast. Kejriwal wasnt brave enough to take on the dissidents and address their concerns but conveniently left for a retreat. This cannot be countenanced and people who try to often tie themselves in knots. He should have been there and it shows the same kind of mudsling proofing that BJP has demonstrated and just shows a lack of character. 

I cannot even begin to get into the Tomar episode and the mishandling by them. Its a sign of incompetence of epic proportions. How the police became so prompt in acting on it is another matter. If AAP claimed to be a party of difference and change how could not have whetted their candidates is beyond me. 

The matter of the donation has still not been adequately explained, o am not even going to start commenting on the cult of kejriwal being promoted. Some prominent women activists have left the party citing that its leadership is misogynistic, this is a matter for introspection. And that ad... its just in poor taste.

Enough of the rant, i have a feeling i am going to be pilloried by both sides but i thought an airing of my thoughts might atleast explain how i bought into both the BJP and AAP story as it were and feel betrayed by them.

Second, he is not a fugitive. 

Third, Raje is involved with modi since a long time. They have had business dealings(read bribery) much before these elections when modi came to power. 

Fourth, When lalit modi outed the secrets of tharoor and pawar, congress put cases on him and kicked him out of IPL. But even then, he is still NOT a fugitive. He's a billionaire who created IPL from the muck of BCCI which is run by Indian politicians because it means some serious money. He paid everyone because if you don't, you can't really do anything.

The physical internet comes to any country through [submarine fiber optic cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable). These are different from the usual ones, they are very well shielded and carry hundreds of Terabytes of data at once.


Once it reaches India, it goes to a landing station and eventually a termination Station. 


Getting these cables laid takes a lot of money. Reliance and Tata (VSNL) own the majority of cables coming to India. Hence the control the Internet. They charge exorbitant prices from ISPs, which is eventually reflected in your bill. And the GoI or BSNL does not own any cables.


The Government could have broken the monopoly or oligopoly, it even planned to do so, by providing a submarine undersea cable for BSNL. It proposed for one from Singapore to Kolkata, but the plan never materialised. This could have brought down the prices of Internet connection in India.

-------

Having said that, I dunno how ACT Broadband and others can provide so much bandwidth at less prices.But I really wish the Broadband definition speeds went up to 20-25Mbps, it can set the bar and FUP or no FUP, it would be illegal to bring the speeds below this.



I don't see the point.... On one side we have brands giving us 4K, 1080p video calls, and on other hand we have 512kbps and FUP...

79,"Troubles for Vasundhara Raje mounted with the disclosure that she was the beneficiary of investments of over Rs 11 crore made by tainted Lalit Modi in her son's company at a high premium.

---

&gt; * Lalit Modi had invested over Rs 11 crore in this company at a huge premium of over Rs 96,000 per share of Rs 10.This disclosure generated charges that Raje had benefited from Modi's controversial investments which the Rajasthan BJP President Ashok Parnami rebutted by claiming tonight that these shares had been ""gifted"" to her by Dushyant and his wife Niharika.Dushyant and his wife had gifted 1615 and 1665 shares, respectively to Raje on her birthday, according to Parnami who saw nothing wrong with it.As opposition Congress upped its ante demanding Raje's ouster, finance minister Arun Jaitley met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and is understood to have discussed various aspects of the raging controversy including the legal implications and the political fallout.Jaitley, who on Thursday night had said that ""nobody is tainted"", later met BJP president Amit Shah and is believed to have deliberated upon the party's strategy to brazen out the massive row involving Raje as well as external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj.High level BJP sources said tonight that there was ""illiteracy"" regarding the entire episode concerning Modi's investments in Dushyant's company.

&gt; * The company had taken a loan of Rs 4 crore in 2009 by cheque and another loan of Rs 7.5 crore in 2010.There was no illegality in any of this and the value of shares was not inflated but was actually deflated, they said.Raje, meanwhile, met some top leaders of the state unit, including party unit chief Ashok Parnami in Jaipur, and dismissed media reports about a signature campaign by 120 party MLAs in her support.Reacting to this, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said in New Delhi that Raje's Income Tax returns for the years under question have been scrutinised by the IT department, which found nothing wrong.BJP secretary Shrikant Sharma told reporters that the party ""fully supports Vasundhara Raje who is our tallest leader in Rajasthan.

&gt; * By levelling such allegations, Congress is indulging political vendetta against her and targeting decades-old family relations between her and Lalit Modi,"" the state BJP chief said.Referring to the controversial 'affidavit' in support of Lalit Modi, he said the signature on it was that of Raje but it was only a ""draft"" which was ""never"" presented before any court or any other legal body in the UK.

&gt; * ""Similarly today, the CM is holding public hearing in which MLAs and party workers are meeting"", the spokesman said.The CMO said the Chief Minister never asked or made any call to MLAs to show their strength and support.State health minister Rajendra Rathore went a step further to claim that Raje, then Leader of Opposition in Rajasthan, said the controversy was a ""storm in a tea cup"" as ""there has been no benefit to anyone"" in any deal.He added that Raje will attend the meeting of NITI Aayog in Delhi tomorrow, making it clear that she was not quitting.Asked about reports that the Raje government had given land to a cancer hospital of Portugal where Lalit Modi's wife was treated, he said an MoU was signed in 2014 for setting up of the hospital in the state for the benefit of the people.Rathore said the Portuguese hospital was selected among various options, including an American ""where Congress president Sonia Gandhi gets treated"".

&gt; * NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government has awarded a record 56 defence manufacturing permits to private sector entities in the past year, which is more than the 47 licences its predecessor UPA granted in the preceding three years combined and underlines its determination to have indigenous defence production as a cornerstone of its 'Make in India' drive.Data released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) shows that a slew of applications, some of which had been pending for more than four years, have been cleared since the BJP government came to power, in what is a major endorsement by it of the Indian private sector's ability to operate in an arena that has until now been the preserve of foreign vendors and state-run entities.

&gt; * The permits are the first step in the process to enable firms such as Mahindra, Tata and Pipavav to set up production units for major military equipment.The Tatas will now be able to upgrade major fighting units like the T 90 and T 72 tanks of the Indian Army , while Mahindra, which has been steadily expanding its defence business in the past year, has been given permits in a number of areas, including manufacturing naval systems like torpedoes, sea mines and boats.Subsidiary companies like Mahindra Telephonics Integrated Systems and Tech Mahindra Ltd too have got defence permits.The permits are not only for the big boys of Indian industry, many of whom have existing defence arms and will be able to diversify their portfolios.. A slew of new small firms are poised to enter the sector based on these clearances.

&gt; * ""It is now up to the private sector to leverage these enhanced flexibilities and deliver on the ground,"" said Ankur Gupta of Ernst &amp; Young India.The expedited clearances are part of a series of measures taken by the government over the past year to open up the defence sector.Since taking charge in May last year, the government has increased the foreign investment limit for the defence sector to 49% and even up to 100% in select cases.It has already made the process for application online and the validity of the Industrial license has been enhanced to seven years.

&gt; * For smaller items like components, speedy DIPP clearances are already being given.A new defence procurement policy is expected over the next few weeks that will further clarify complex matters such as the offset policy, blacklisting process as well as a specific route for the Make in India process.

104,"Smart cities are definitely a good idea.

But I'm sceptical about their nitty gritty and working mechanism which govt has yet to formulate. Smart city projects can be successful only when the municipalities are run by professionals chosen on the merit rather than typical govt appointed servants.

Most of the smart city projects around the world have world class garbage disposal system. None of our metro have any of them. I wish govt would have experimented with same in Delhi/Mumbai or somewhere else. God, garbage is getting a big nuisance in Delhi. Garbage Disposal system requires investment of over USD 2 billion and it can create thousand of jobs. Of course, govt can create a PPP model to meet the funding.

Whereas it is welcome step from Mr. Modi, I wish they first implemented some of the smart city features in existing metros and  do a SWOT analysis. This would have led better implementation of Smart Cities

One of the problems of political parties in India is they create a program (Swach Bharat, MNREGA, PMJRY) for every issue rather than creating a institution for same. Problems with such programs is that once the leader is gone, program is gone as well.

While this is highly appreciating of Mr. Modi to make us self-conscious about the Swacch Bharat Program, it barely did anything in reality. He attempted a mass revolution with it and failed. Instead, he could have institutionalized it. For e.g:- he could have made municipalities autonomous and more accountable. Currently municipalaties are rotten from inside and stinks of politics. he could have cleaned em, brought a new policy legislation whereby they're more independent yet more accountable. If you look at best cities of the world, their mayor are autonomous, they act more like a professional CEOs.

I'm not criticizing Mr. Modi, I'm just showing the typical mindset of whole political class. Programs like AIDS, Polio, family planning etc have been more or less successful led by politicians more in the fashion of mass revolution. but you can't solve the problems by mass revolution for which institutionalization is required.

Look at our political history, none of political brass seem to have understanding of how to solve bigger problems at massive scale. Most of come, do the tinkering and just go.


Lastly, not sure about the smart project city projects, but Mr. Modi is definitely is doing some of things which can improve the lives in existing cities. For instance, govt will now be trasnfering much bigger share of taxes to states with certain conditions. Of course, govt can ask for example, UP to spend at least 5% of all money on cleanliness while transferring the money. Mr. Suresh Goyal is going to spend a big part of coal receipts into clean energy and expecting 100GW solar energy production by 2022. He is also encouraging LEDs for street lights which will save billion of dollars annually. Current govt is also increasing the speed of existing trains.

&gt;* In his 2014 affidavit, while Dushyant stated that he, along with his wife and business partner Niharika, owned shares in Niyant hotels, he did not list any commercial properties acquired/owned by the company.

&gt;* However, in his poll affidavit last year, Dushyant put the value of these shares at Rs 10 and did not list the Dholpur palace as property owned either by him, or his company Niyant hotels.

133,"Smart Cities project can work. But there are problems with the way the government has projected it. It is not clearly defined at all. 













--------
Barring the Jan Dhan Yojana, Social Security schemes and the Cashless Payments systems, I don't think the Government has made any real headway in 2 other schemes that would have ~~made our~~ been instrumental in making out cities smarter.

Let's start with the the **SWACCH BHARAT** Scheme.


My hypothesis is that for this scheme to work three points have to be kept in mind - 

* **Teaching civic sense to people**, to actually tell them to clean their surroundings, also that a sanitation workers job is not beneath them and to treat them and the surrounding environment with dignity. This is about showing the mirror to the people.

* **Getting the technology and protocols in place** This is where a lot of work needs to be done. Because India is certainly lacking in technology and the people who understand them and can work with them. Protocols, because well, for example, how many people know how to use a roundabout properly or where are the recycle centres in the city. Technology would be the base and Protocols would define how the technologies in various sectors would interact with each other. 

* **Getting the Required Laws** Let's face it. Our cities are broken. A large part of this stems due to the fact that the Municipal Corporations are separate entities, than say, the public works department, the water department, the sewage department, etc. and the Mayor happens to be just a figure-head than a man with power. He is controlled more by the political forces than the people's welfare. So for this scheme to work, we need Institutional changes in the city's management.



And Modi's ""Swacch Bharat"" campaign hit the ""Teaching the Civic Sense to people"" right in the head but for cleaning India he MUST to act on the 2 other points. Soon. Otherwise this will never work. Photo ops by various entities, people, public figures, companies, won't work. Because at the end of the day, everyone, you , me, your neighbor, the sanitation worker, the mayor, etc. have to work together and at full efficiency to get India completely clean.


**ROAD TRANSPORT** 


After a BJP minister's death in Maharashtra last year, the government promised us ""Radical"" changes in Driving License and Road Transport mechanism within 6 months. RTOs were to be done with, huge sky-high fines for breaking rules, changes to driving license tests, Toll gates were to be done with, etc.


If they had gone ahead with this they would have seen that laws aren't enough. They would have realised that great **urban planning and urban engineering** also plays a crucial role in this. Actually a lot of bad decisions taken by drivers, can be attributed to bad engineering and planning.



The Swacch Bharat and Road Transport were one of the examples where the Government is falling short.


So am I blaming the BJP or Modi for everything? Nope.... I am NOT.



For me Smart Cities are defined by my last post here:

http://www.np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3b1i2m/three_major_initiatives_towards_urban_development/csi4t7a


&gt; ....... what makes our cities smarter are its ability to adapt to any contingency.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not talking about the in-your-face contingencies like floods, but the little problems which lead to bigger contingencies. Little problems like the street light not working, flooding in your ward, piped gas leak, overflowing sewerage drains, etc. But whom do you contact? How can you contact him/her? That too Fast. No ""Please check the number you've dialled"", or unresponsive emails.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine if a part of major road is unusable(for construction or accident) in your city, just think the amount of time people will waste, figuring out which alternate route they'll have to take, the fuel wasted and the time too.
&gt; 
&gt; But what if you had been informed of the construction a few days ago? You could have chalked out an alternate route before travel. Better yet, what if your city's [smartness/brain] could have provided that information to services like Google Maps or Microsoft Maps, so if you used that for drive, alternate routes could have been generated automatically. See now, the information is actionable. Its not just dumb display. But more services can be derived from it.
&gt; 
&gt; Scenario 2: A road accident, a part of the road is blocked.
&gt; 
&gt; In case of a construction, the info comes days earlier, but in case of an accident? What if your city's [smartness/brain] could have marked off that area and provided this information to GMaps and others??
&gt; 
&gt; You save Money on fuel and more importantly your Time.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is what Smart City is all about. Breaking down all the useless noises that bog you down. Making your lives in the city safe, efficient and easy.





But am I saying that we should focus on smartness aspect of the City? Forget about water, sanitation and food and shelter? NOPE. Not by any chance.


Because that would be plain dumb.



Think of a city like a human body. The brain gives you smartness and controls the involuntary and voluntary actions too. But it only IFF, the others systems are in place already and the brains controls them.


So a city is like an organism, you need to have the systems in place before you can actually get the ""smartness"" in. A lot of the ""smart cities"" around the world had the systems in place before they started integrating and controlling everything together. Once they started integrating, they started ""defining protocols"" and the various parts of the system.


In India, currently almost every system in place is more of a face-saving feature than anything else and each system is developed on its own with little to no regard for other systems. *Its like your kidney decided to develop a little bigger than the space available...*


And when any systems in India are repaired or are developed they are on their own, like for example, if a road is being built, the drainage system or the fibre optics present below are cut. Its like a doctor fixed your kidney but left little incisions on the intestines and finally says""Your kidney works, right??So why the fuss?"".


This is what is happening and what will always happen if the current development process goes on.



Its not just about building but building for the future, making the infrastructure modular and defining everything(I mean everything!! from the height of sidewalks to height of road surface, rules for storm drains) and every parameter about them and how they integrate with others. What is allowed and what isn't. 


Only then can your city start to be Smart.",2015-06-28 00:43:30

136,"With eye firmly on China, India to hold naval exercises with Japan, Australia, Myanmar and others

---

&gt;* But it does not mean there is no strategic game plan underway.Sources on Friday said India will hold a flurry of bilateral naval exercises over the coming months with countries in the critical Asia Pacific region, ranging from Australia, Japan and Indonesia to Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar and Singapore.

&gt;* Interspersed with them will be exercises with the US (Malabar), UK (Konkan) and Russia (Indra), with the one with France (Varuna) already being held in Arabian Sea in April-May.As was first reported by TOI, India has ""so far"" kept Japan out of the initial planning for the 19th Indo-US Malabar naval combat exercise to be held in Bay of Bengal in October.

&gt;* This despite the Modi-Obama summits in September and January agreeing ""to upgrade"" the annual wargames, and both Japan and Australia keen to hop on to the bandwagon.The previous UPA regime largely restricted the Malabar exercise to a bilateral one after China protested against its 2007 edition in Bay of Bengal especially since they were expanded to include the Japanese, Australian and Singaporean navies as well.

&gt;* Since then, Japan has been co-opted only when the Malabar was held in the north-western Pacific in 2009 and 2014.Interestingly, the Bay of Bengal will be the venue for India's first-ever IN-RAN naval exercise with Australia from October 30 to November 4 as well as the JIMEX exercise with Japan thereafter in mid-November.Around the same time, Indian and Thai warships will also hold their coordinated patrolling along their international maritime boundary line.

&gt;* Apart from supplying military hardware and software, India is already training Vietnamese personnel on Kilo-class submarines and now proposes to do the same for Sukhoi fighter jets.Much like Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines and others locked in territorial disputes with China in the East and South China Seas, India remains deeply suspicious of Beijing's expanding military might and assertiveness in Asia-Pacific.China, in its latest policy document on defence, has also vowed to increase its ""open seas protection"" in tune with its expanding long-range deployments of nuclear submarines, destroyers and frigates far away from its shores.

&gt; * 14-15 parameters have been set out in 8-9 sensitive areas like Telecom, ports, civil aviation, uplinking/downlinking of TV channels or FM stations and FIPB proposals,"" the top home ministry official said.The Home Ministry has also written to Department of Telecommunications to set up adequate testing facilities as agencies estimate that about 65% of telecom equipment installed in India is of Chinese origin.

&gt; * MHA, in its policy, has also spelt out locations where foreign investment is not welcome - such as locations close to border and vital installations.The MHA has also decided to do away with the security clearance need for Multi-System Operators (MSOs) -- basically cable operators.ET has earlier reported in May that the Home Ministry had agreed to the long-standing demand of the Finance Ministry to decide on security clearances to investment proposals before the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) within 30 days, reducing the period drastically from 90 days at present, in a fillip to 'ease of doing business' mantra of the Narendra Modi Government.

145,"&gt; You need a logical reasoning 101 bro, every line you say contradicts the other.

I could start by blaming ur poor reasoning abilities 

&gt; You agree that our SC fucks up too same like USs'.

Pitching two supreme courts of two different countries against each other was meant to give a glimpse into the history of racist interpretation and anti-constitutional verdicts of USA and indian SC record is better than tht of US'

&gt; Then you say fuck ups of our SC is due to the lack of social activism but somehow this is not true for SC of USA! how?

in case of homosexuality,yes!! homosexuality is still in the stage of being ridiculed,movies make fun of homosexuality and so on...in this environment i dont think SC entertains any such petitions...if the parliament is also not willing to debate it and finds the homosexuals as westernised buffoons...then change wont happen overnight..**the fight so far is only on the 377 which criminalises homosexuality and it's not the SC job to repeal the archaic laws...it's the job of the parliament and y ppl arent ready asking the parliament to repeal???? MODI govt repealed a lot of archaic laws and why no one suggested the govt(directly elected by the ppl and a govt accountable to the ppl!!!!)

&gt; Then you create a strawman saying that I blamed SC for every ill plaguing our country, which I never said.

you did say... **SC upheld ban on homosexuals, did not do anything during emergency, let astrology be called a science**
these issues are not in the ambit of supreme court to discuss when the civil society at large is dumb stupid and happily napping away...it's the job of the enlightened electorate and the govts to pass legislations tht ban such anti-science and regressive practices etc...let me be very clear...
**job of Supreme court is to review the laws made by the parliament by interpretation the constitution...it's job is not to make laws and do social activism....our SC is famous for it's social activism because the society  is dumb stupid and ignorant and tht's why it takes such painful measures to sit on judgement on issues it frankly need not care abt...in enlightened countries with a vibrant civil society tht would amount to judicial overreach** but here in india everyone wants SC intervention in every fucking case because they dont have confidence in the legislative or executive to do the right thing and SC can only do so much given its constraints of time and number of cases....real change comes thru legislations passed by parliament...if the electorate is brain dead tht it cant ask the parliament to even discuss on this issue then y the fuck should SC even poke its nose into the issue which is a fringe issue and the ppl it effects are not even willing to organise and gather public support!!!

&gt; You say that losing when challenging a regressive law is not SC's fault but that of the arguer's, however you yourself blame US SC for judging in favor of regressive laws, why shouldn't it be arguer's fault there too?

in us sc history reeks of anti-constitutional verdicts i did refer to the book...unlike US SC indian SC was very proactive in protecting the rights of citizens in most cases...yet to hear a strong argument where SC compromised civil liberties(emergency was a dead low in SC history but indira gandhi elected her lackeys to suit her needs..many senior lawyers who were anti indira were sidelined completely....) of citizens...our constitution is a primarily a social document be it the DPSP,fundamental rights,adult franchise etc...

Im fully confident of SC's capabilities to protect the rights and freedoms of every citizen in India...the same cannot be said of US...where voting rights is still a struggle across many states...and a recent judgement by US SC threatened the minority voters rights in southern states...chekc tht out!!!",2015-06-28 08:41:59

175,"True, it was Advani who shielded Modi but it was also the entire BJP executive committee and party fraternity that supported Modi in the Goa BJP conclave. There are tons of material on what had transpired. It is kinda long story, but worth knowing. After all, it is the background of our current PM. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Advani's memoir, he notes two instances where he and Vajpayee, had 'significant differences', one over the continuance of Modi after riot and the other being the association of BJP with Ayodhya movement. Advani wrote, 'Although Atalji had not expressed his view explicitly on the matter, I knew he favoured Modi resignation. And he knew that I disfavoured it.'

In the two hour flight from Delhi to Goa, Vajpayee was visibly in a sombre mood. The protagonists in the story apart from these two were Arun Shourie and Jaswant Singh. 

Singh asked Vajpayee what he thought of Modi. Vajpayee replied **Kam se kam isteefa ka offer to karte(At least should have offered resignation)**. Advani said, 'If Narendra's quitting is going to improve the situation in Gujarat, I am willing to tell him to offer his resignation. But I don not think that it would help. Also, I am not sure whether the party's national Council or Executive would accept the offer.'

Advani called Modi when they landed in Goa and asked to offer resignation. **Modi readily agreed**. In the meeting, Modi explained the Godhra and post-Godhra violence in the perspective of Gujarat's long history of communal violence. He ended his speech saying, 'Nevertheless, as head of the government, I take responsibility for what has happened in my state. I am ready to tender my resignation.'

But the 100 odd members of NC and special invitees chorused, 'isteefa mat do, isteefa mat do'(Do not resign x 2). Advani said that he consulted the senior leaders there and everyone were opposed against the resignation. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jaswant Singh's version:

In Walk the talk with Shekhar Gupta, Jaswant singh recounted the experience. Vajpayee asked his three co-passengers, 'What should be done with Gujarat'? Nobody answered. Vajpayee continued, 'Gujarat ke bareme soch te hain' (Have to think about Gujarat). Then Advani went to the toilet. Vajpayee pointed to him and asked Singh, 'Poochiye fir kya karna hain'(Ask him what should be done). When Advani returned and Singh asked him, Advani said, 'Bawal khada ho jayega party mein'(There would be problems in party). 

Shekhar Gupta asked, did Advani rescued Modi while Vajpayee wanted him to be removed, Jaswant Singh said, **'I think that is correct.'**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arun Shourie's version

In Walk the talk interview with Shekhar Gupta, Shourie said, that when Vajpayee was at a foreign tour, Modi continued to be the chief minister. Vajpayee was visibly affected at seeing no one spoke against him. He came to India resolving to throw Modi out. Shourie said, **I was more affected by Atalji's pain than by what had happened in Gujarat. Maybe this is my inhumanity or something. I can't claim that I was that great liberal.**

At the end of conversation in the flight, 'it was definitely decided that Advaniji will ring up Modi and say that in the meeting in the evening, offer to resign.' At the meeting in his speech, Modi said, 'I don't wish that the party should have any difficulties because of me'. 

Shourie continued, 'And as if on cue, people from different parts of the hall started saying, ""absolutely no...koi galti nahi hain..."" (You have committed no mistake). Sitting at back, Shourie saw Vajpayee's **'bewilderment because he thought this was a done deal. This was like an orchestrated coup against him'**. He continued, 'so there is absolutely no doubt, that Atalki was completely thwarted'. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With everyone against him and understanding that hardliners would prevail, Vajpayee changed his stance in the same conclave. And had said on the evening of 12 April, 'wherever Muslims live, they don't like to live in co-existence with others, they don't like to mingle with others, and instead of propagating their ideas in a peaceful manner, they want to spread their faith by resorting to terror and threats. The world has become alert to this danger.....'

Although Vajpayee later changed his stance and said something different. 

EDIT: I see tons of spelling and grammar mistakes. Not gonna touch, I wrote in a hurry. Sorry for them.",2015-06-28 14:55:13

He has written the book 'When a tree shook Delhi: 1984 carnage and it's aftermath' along with H.S.Phoolka, who is the lawyer who founded CJC (Citizen's justice committee) and fought for the victims against Union of India. The court cases dragged until 2005, I guess. 

He is a patron of 'Campaign for judicial accountability and judicial reforms' along with an advisory board member of Amnesty International India. 

I have already read the book on anti-sikh riots and believe me when I say, that he and Phoolka teared down Congress, along with Rajiv Gandhi and Delhi HC. 

This book is vital, very important, because it is based on the court documents, the G.T. Nanavati commission reports, the SIT reports, the call data records collected by the police officer Rahul Sharma during Gulberg society and Naroda Patiya massacre, the NHRC reports, the letter by Modi to Kalam. In fact, it has the Julian Assange type bibliography and further reading, which are present in his 'When Google Met Wikileaks' book. All the documents, versions, statements are annexed and quoted. 

I mean, there are few books written on the communal riots in India. This book and the book on 1984 riot are special, because they don't focus on riots. They focus on the legalities after the riots. Reading the book on sikh riots, gave me a feeling that India is far from a democracy. I cannot force you to read but I wish you read. 

However, if you want any specific part of the court ruling, I can quote. I mean of course I cannot go over 2000 pages of ruling and I am no where capable of doing so, but if the book contains quotes from it, I can give a try. we can always cross verify when we have time. ",2015-06-28 23:28:37

&gt;* Of all the major political parties seeking votes in the 2014 elections, the BJP, through its prime ministerial candidate, offered the Indian electorate perhaps the most cohesive, if troubling, vision for the country.

&gt;* Next was communal fundamentalism, constituting barely -disguised hostility towards religious minorities, especially Muslims, which was the main rallying agenda on the ground in electorally-crucial states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

&gt;* This is the new India which celebrates when Indias richest man, Mukesh Ambani, follows up his gift of a 60-million-dollar jet-plane to his wife with the most expensive residence in the world, a twenty seven-storey house for a family of four, built at an estimated cost of one billion dollars, which boasts three helipads, four storeys of hanging gardens, and a staff of 600 domestic helpers.

&gt; * Thus, government plans a model law which can be adopted by states and modified as per their requirements,"" said a senior official.Government is of the view that self-regulation is not sufficient and a law to enforce the cleanliness drive will help the purpose.Issues like punishment, fine and enforcement of the law are being worked out on the lines of traffic challan s so that the violators can be booked on the spot.To avoid overlapping, the new law will be interwoven with existing rules in related sectors to make judicial approach to check practice of creating unhygienic atmosphere comprehensive and effective.The official pointed out that swine flu outbreak in a particular area affects the entire country, therefore, cleanliness cannot be termed as a local issue.At a review meeting recently, the PMO had expressed desire that laws governing cleanliness be examined so a comprehensive Act can be brought.In the past, various Central ministries have framed model bills for states to follow.

&gt; * It provides for protection of livelihoods right, social security of street vendors and regulation of urban street vending in the country.To implement the law at the grassroots level, setting up town vending committees in each local authority was proposed.

&gt; * Though street vending is a local issue, Parliament had enacted the law in the interest of street vendors and people at large, the official pointed out.Prime Minister Modi had picked a broom and swept the streets of the capital on October 2, launching a nationwide campaign to raise awareness about cleanliness and better sanitation.The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary to inform people about the link between sanitation and public health.

My biggest disappointment from the BJP stock pile of second-rate leaders. Fucker passed a law which prohibited the police from registering FIRs against ministers etc. without prior approval. I'm saddened. Serious lack of leadership.

&gt;So just because politicians get work done (which is just Sushma ji btw, not Raje), we should forgive them? Got it.

Either you are too young or you don't understand politics - the cliched 'art of the possible'. Don't forgive them. Remember that they are tainted but also look at what they are doing to offset that. This is precisely why the corruption in the UPA was simply unacceptable. Billions of dollars was received in kickbacks while the entire power infrastructure in the country was in shambles. The defense sector had so much corruption while the armed forces were literally guarding our borders using potatoes.

---

&gt;* As Lalit Modi regurgitates dirty secrets on the twitterverse on an hourly basis and our rulers and erstwhile conscience keepers retreat deeper into their carapaces, a distinct pattern appears to be emerging of how a few individuals and families have taken over this country by manipulating the processes of democracy, and are now sucking it drier than the East India Company ever did.

&gt;* Most of our leading newspapers and News Channels are owned / managed by business interests ( Bennet Coleman, Mukesh Ambani, Bhartiyas) or politicians( Jayalalitha, the Marans, Rajeev Shukla, Chandan Mitra, the Badals, Karthikeya Sharma).

&gt;* It is common knowledge where the SAHARA moneys came from and where they went, but our oligarchs are certainly not interested in the truth becoming public, so Subroto Roy remains in jail: he will pay the bail amount some day and walk free and everyone will breathe easier.

&gt;* Five thousand poor farmers have committed suicide in the last one year under pressure to repay their loans, but one of our high flying( literally) multi-millionaires who owes more than Rupees seven billion to the banks continues to party in his private jets and Mediterranean villas and produce movies for his son.

&gt;* Official secrets are stolen from central ministries and the companies doing so identified ( yes, they belong to our 1% club) but only class four employees and middle level managers arrested: the long arm of the law in India shrinks in direct proportion to the moneys and oligarchs involved.

&gt;* Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the #SelfieWithDaughter campaign, which trended on Twitter on Sunday.

&gt;* The tweet was a veiled reference to the nearly-two-year-old political scandal dubbed 'Snoopgate', when Modi's close aide Amit Shah (now president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party) allegedly surveilled a woman illegally under the former's orders.

&gt;* Meanwhile, at least one Twitter user expressed regret that the PM's campaign, meant to promote gender equality, had been reduced to a two-person online battle.

&gt;* Over 500 riots have been reported in Uttar Pradesh at different places in the year 2014 particularly on smaller issues such as noise of the loudspeakers, petty squabbles, village land disputes particularly common properties, cow slaughtering or beef eating.

&gt;* Hence it is important to instill a sense of pride among Hindus which is only possible through rewriting history and for that all Mughals have to be decried and denounced as outsiders and hence as Rajnath Singh said, Akbar may have been great but Maha Rana Pratap was definitely greater, and interesting part is added in a mythology which he just created saying that even Vietnams revolution was inspired by Prataps valor.

&gt;* This edifice based on superstructure of caste does not allow people to convert into Hinduism as in case some body want to convert to Hindiusm then which caste would you place him and therefore it makes mockery of the entire ghar-wapasi exercise even technically and in legal terms most of these campaign are intimidating the minorities and Dalits and using their vulnerabilities and yet no action has been taken against any of those who committed these crimes.

&gt;* Now the party is in power and should ask its ministers to reveal all the data of appeasement of Muslims for our knowledge as what is their percentage in our government services, police, army, administration as well as in Parliament so that the nation know what is the reality of appeasement.

&gt;* The Mann Ki Baat of Narendra Modi, the tech-savviest Prime Minister to date, took Twitter by storm on Sunday when he asked people to post selfies with their daughters.

&gt;* The hashtag #SelfieWithDaughter soon started trending worldwide, with several fathers as well as mothers tweeting pictures of themselves with their daughters.

&gt;* Ehsan Jafris wife Zakia Jafri accused the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for being complicit in the riots.

&gt;* Nevertheless, the SIT probe gave a clean chit to Narendra Modis government with regard to the riots.

&gt;* Nishrin Jafri shared an image with her late father Ehsan, saying SelfieWithDaughter: This one will haunt him for ever..

&gt;* A careful examination of the snoopgate tapes would however disclose a startling fact which has escaped everybodys attention so far  that Gujarat CM Narendra Modi himself was conducting a secondary line of surveillance by getting Mansi Sonis phone calls tapped/recorded/archived through the then IG of CID Intelligence (State) Shri Arun K Sharma.

&gt;* The responsibility of the primary line of surveillance  that of physically stalking and snooping Mansi Soni, her family and Pradeep Sharma throughout the period between 4th August to 8th September, 2009 was entrusted to Amit Shah.

&gt;* The independent line of surveillance that Saheb had undertaken is revealed by Amit Shah himself who chided GL Singhal on 9th August, 2009, for not doing the job of tracking Mansi properly.

&gt;* In fact a new tape, of a conversation that happened on the evening of 22nd August, 2009, reveals Amit Shah candidly admitting that Saheb had far better information about the snooping than he or the entire police team had.

Some great movements here around re-thinking labor laws, GST etc. 

Infrastructure: 5/10. Lots of talk, can't see much happening. Massive investments are needed in roads, public transport, internet etc Apparently Gadkari is planning major things. I can only comment when I see average Indian internet speed reach 10mbps in yearly Akamai reports, mass 4G rollouts, quality roads etc

HRD: 7/10. Not that bad at all. Smriti Irani gets a lot of unnecessary flak from the Indian left (possibly because she did retarded TV shows in the past). Increasing stipend of researchers, reducing board marks weightage in JEE etc are all good moves in my books.

Similarly, a lot has been said about swatch bharat. I hope we see results soon.

Foreign Policy, Defense : 8/10 for both. Some really great things here. 

Social: 1/10 Pretty abysmal. I wasn't expecting much here. There have been some retarded moves here. Not just the beef ban - but also random stunts by BJP members like Ghar Wapsi. 


Overall: Average to Good (6/10)
imo UPA 2 was abysmal (2/10), UPA 1 was equally bad. NDA 1 was not higher than 6/10 and previous governments were worse.

---

&gt;* Moody's Investors Service expects India's weakened rural economy to remain subdued through the fiscal year ending March 2016 (FY2016), particularly if the risk of below-average monsoon rainfall materializes.

&gt;* ""A sustained soft patch for India's rural economy would weigh on private consumption and non-performing assets in the agricultural sector, a credit negative for the sovereign and banks,"" says Rahul Ghosh, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Research Analyst.

&gt;* The slower rural income growth is partly the result of increased fiscal restraint by the central government, which Moody's believes is unlikely to change in the coming quarters.

&gt;* The publication also includes key takeaways from a number of audience polls carried out during the first annual Moody's and ICRA India Credit Conference in Mumbai, which took place in May.

&gt;* Notwithstanding these growth expectations, our polling results pointed to some disappointment amongst the audience with regard to the pace of reform under the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and increasing concerns about the risk of policy stagnation.

289,"So this article by James Traub is a classic example of someone with zero understanding of India and its history pontificating from his high perch.  First, there is a glaring factual mistake.  India does NOT have the ""..second largest Muslim population"" in the World.  That would be Pakistan with 183 million people.  Second, in the first few paragraphs Traub does a masterful job of mouthing half-baked ill-informed 'liberal' cliches such as: ""...Modi is himself a product of the militant, trident-shaking wing of the BJP known as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)"", ""A number of churches were vandalized. A 71-year-old nun in the eastern state of West Bengal was gang-raped. And the beef-ban movement was spreading to new states."", etc.  Never mind RSS is neither ""militant"" nor ""trident-shaking"".  That would be outfits like Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad.  And, of course, why bother with minor details like the rapist of the West Bengal nun turned out to be a Moslem Bangladeshi named Nazrul (http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nun-rape-case-main-accused-arrested-in-kolkata-772792).  Then there is the 'beef-ban' that is termed as a ""visceral blow"" [to the Moslems].  The ""sturdy"" Suffian Mohammad (Traub's translator) is ""suffering"" because his family can't buy ""2 kilograms"" of beef ""every three days"" because he does not like chicken!  No mention is made of the mainstay of India's non-vegetarian population - goat meat.  Question for Mr. Traub - would any Moslem majority country in the World sanction hog-slaughter for its minorities?  For that matter would orthodox Israel (Mr. Traub's presumed historic tribal homeland) willingly allow pig slaughter for its European (i.e., Russian, Polish, and German) Jews who grew up eating Kilbeisa in their country of birth?  Cows are an emotive issues for the Hindus - why is it so hard for outsiders to understand?  Would Americans sanction dog-slaughter in their country?  I recall a movement in the UK which focused on getting Chinese to stop eating dogs....because ""dogs are man's best friend"".  If 20,000 Moslems in Aurangabad are rendered unemployed due to the ban - they need to re-train and find another profession.  That is the mantra of capitalism and Traub should know that. 

Blaming Hindus for Moslem ills in India has become knee-jerk 'habitus' of ill-informed liberals with scant knowledge of facts on the ground.  The unfortunate lack of modern education among Indian Moslems (and Moslems around the World) is self induced.  In Delhi alone the the drop-out rate of Moslems from secular schools approaches 98%!  In India's hyper-competitive exams for Engineering, Medicine, et. al. (where the religious identities of the candidates are masked by a ""roll number"") the Moslem success stories are so few that one wonders why the Owaisis and Azam Khans of India are not alarmed.  Lack of education and over-reliance on Koranic dogma from 7th century Arabia...in them lies the crux of Moslem misery and isolation the World over.  Until that is acknowledged and understood by the Moslems themselves - there is little hope for the community of 'Mohammad'.    ",2015-06-30 08:34:50

&gt; * So the critical question is, is it only FEMA that the ED is pursuing against Lalit Modi?

297,"As the Narendra Modi government celebrates Sanskrit, a look at the oldest known speakers of the language: the Mitanni people of Syria.

---

&gt; * While Sanskrit is a marker of Hindu nationalism for the BJP, it might be surprised, even shocked, to know that the first people to leave behind evidence of having spoken Sanskrit aren't Hindus or Indians ? they were Syrians.The earliest form of Sanskrit is that used in the Rig Veda (called Old Indic or Rigvedic Sanskrit).

&gt; * Amazingly, Rigvedic Sanskrit was first recorded in inscriptions found not on the plains of India but in in what is now northern Syria.Between 1500 and 1350 BC, a dynasty called the Mitanni ruled over the upper Euphrates-Tigris basin, land that corresponds to what are now the countries of Syria, Iraq, and Turkey.

&gt; * Moreover, the Mitanni military aristocracy was composed of chariot warriors called ?maryanna?, from the Sanskrit word ""marya"", meaning ?young man?.The Mitanni worshipped the same gods as those in the Rig Veda (but also had their own local ones).

&gt; * If Sanskrit, the liturgical language of Hinduism, has a history that predates its arrival in India, that really does pull the rug from out under the feet of Hindutva.Ironically, twin country Pakistan?s national myths go in the exact opposite direction: their of-kilter Islamists attempt to make foreign Arabs into founding fathers and completely deny their subcontinental roots.Both national myths, whether Arab or Sanskrit, attempt to imagine a pure, pristine origin culture uncontaminated by unsavoury influences.

&gt; This is what the SIT’s background note says about the Gulberg incident: “On the day of the bandh, i.e. 28.02.2002, a huge mob comprising about 20,000 Hindus gathered, armed with deadly arm weapons, in furtherance of their common intention and indulged in attack on the properties, shops and houses of Muslims as well as a madrasa/mosque of Gulberg society located in Meghaninagar, Ahmedabad city, resulting in the death of 39 Muslims, including Ahesan Jafri, ex-MP, injuries to 15 Muslims and 31 Muslims went missing. Late Ahesan Jafri fired from his private, licensed weapon in self defence causing injuries to 15 persons in the mob. One of the victims of the said private firing succumbed to injuries later.”

The 'whataboutism'  around these debates is a diversionary tactic. 

Kavita Krishnan made uncharitable remarks against the PM. In turn, she got remarks made against her. Now, she is trying to turn the debate to 'What About the guys who abused me', 'modi says tweet selfies but WHAT ABOUT 2002' or 'What About this or that'?

In this specific debate, the issue is whether every thing PM says or does needs to be looked through a prism of his past; a past as imagined by likes of Kavita Krishnan'. 

The people who made rape threats against her should be ignored or even prosecuted if she so desires. However, redefining the issue as if she is the victim and blaming everybody (general abusers and not  people who are making rape threats) is stupid.

&gt;* His visit will come after Chinese President Xi Jinpings 2013 visit to all five Stans when he announced billions of dollars in loans to the countries to build energy and transport infrastructure, as well as a year after Russia and China announced a $400 billion gas pipeline that would cover all the central Asian countries in between.

&gt;* Fresh from his visit to China, Mr. Modi will also be looking to work in parallel to Chinas Silk Route initiative, which India is yet to sign on to.

&gt;* The process to elevate India and Pakistan from observers to members is also expected to get under way during the current SCO summit, and it is the first time the Indian PM will attend the grouping of Russia, China, and four of the Stans (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyztan).

&gt;* Putin and Mr. Modi discussed steps to further develop the privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India, as well as several large joint trade and economic projects.

363,"&gt;Why is the overly vocal PM now so silent on the Lalit Modi issue?


It does not warrant an answer by him.


&gt;Why Narendra Modi Silent On 206 crore Rupees Scamer Pankaja Munde?


It is not his prerogative neither it is his government. No FIR and no formal complaint lodged.Trying to politicize the matter.Still just an allegation.


&gt;Is the Modi government credibility at all time low post the Lalit Modi episode?

It is your prerogative. Why all your post is about BJP and Modi?What about your credibility?


&gt;Aren't the ""Lalit Modi Controversy"" &amp;""Smriti Irani's Fake Degree Issue"" the real tests for the Modi Government?

No. These are very trivial issues.In a country like India which has been neglected by subsequent governments it is nothing.Modi should and is investing his energy in transforming India into a better future.


&gt;Did Narendra Modi forget to release Bose declassified documents or doesn't want to ? It's breaking election promise and betraying a national leader too.

No. Things are promised during elections and government is trying to fulfill its poll promises.It will be released but not at the whim of distractors. Wait for it.The government is still here for 4 years.If not full filled in this term ask him about it when next election comes.
 

&gt;Why is Indian govt. attempting to degrade autonomy of prestigious IIM Ahmedabad by IIM bill? Why this bill is more important than focus on Black Money? Does acts of this govt under PM Modi following any different path than UPA?

Because only an elected government is answerable to people,so try respecting the people's mandate.How an agency or institution is being run and how much autonomy it should get is in governments hand.I have no qualms if an elected government decides the syllabus and pattern instead of some random person or a group of person with unknown affiliations and political or social or religious leaning.


&gt;Is Narendra Modi a selfie addict?

He is tech-savvy.Why would you accuse someone of this?Is it a crime? 

 
&gt;Is Prime Minister Modi trying to destroy the four pillars of democracy?

What has he done till now in his long public life for which he has been charged guilty of by a court of law? Assuming something or leveling false allegations are just a way of character assassination. Has he in any way insulted the legislative?He is a great executive, always leading from front.PM has no say in how judiciary works.Media, we all know has not yet been shown its place. So don't worry all pillars are safe.


&gt;Is the Modi government stifling RTI system?

You still have to understand how RTI works. Government has no control or influence upon CIC.


&gt;Does Narendra Modi have an inclination towards supporting Hindus or a hidden agenda behind his activities and being silent for selected situations?

Yes and he should be. I will tell you (as I assume) you suffer from lack of vision or may be a case MATA. I'll let you know that liberals favourite country USA has never had any President who is not christian. In fact no candidate has even won primaries without showing allegiance to church. Too many people in India has voted for him because of his strong Hindu beliefs.People voted for him because India needed a strong Hindu Prime Minister.If you think people only voted for development promises then you are politically naive.


&gt;Is modi the most tainted PM India ever had?

Because he has been falsely accused in the past? What has he done  till now as PM that made you think of this.According to his supporters he is the best thing that has happened to our country.


&gt;What are the similarities between Augustus Nero &amp; Narendra Modi?

It is a below the belt question.I will not answer this but it rather shows your blind hatred toward him.


&gt;Why Modi fans abuse people who criticize PM, Does it reflects their frustration?

You use big words to hide your lack of mental capacity.I'll try to explain this but I doubt you will understand but I will try. Even though you will presented with facts you will not. After trying for  sometime because of your lack of mental fortitude you will not understand. Someone else will come and then he/she will try to explain but it will be in vain,then someone else but you will still fail to understand. So this phenomenon will keep on repeating itself. So it does show their(supporters) frustration that there are people in country who fail to see the goodness of this PM who is trying his heart and soul for his fellow countrymen.

There is nothing wrong in criticizing and questioning your government but to blatantly and blindly keep on accusing someone is not right. So much hatred for one person,what has he done to deserve this?All his life he has lived by a code that nothing is greater in this world than to serve his holy motherland.Do not raise questions over every aspect of governance.Public is king in democracy,you will get your chance after 4 years. Ask then about the promises he has made and what did he deliver.


I think this answer will find you in good mood and not in a hate filled scenario.Ponder over them. Try to see good in people.


Now, answer a few queries of mine if possible.

Why do you not respect the people's mandate?

Do you believe that the majority who have voted for him are idiots?

Why do you hate BJP?

Name your religion and political affiliation.(Religion matters because no matter what he does there will be very few support for him from the minorities.).

366,"This is expected. BJP until now has not been a one-man show.

It was supposed to be Vajpayee/Advani/Joshi succeeded by Jaitley/Swaraj/Mahajan

So this meant there was enough space in the party for a three factions everywhere, and everyone stood a good chance of move up the hierarchy. And even if they didn't immediately succeed, it made sense to stay the course and move up eventually whenever their favoured leader decided to bless them.

Advani spoilt the cultivated party hierarchy in his greed to become PM and then his failure to prevent UPA-2 pretty much guaranteed Modi's rise to the national scene.

Politicians do not change their style of governance, so Modi is going to attempt to do the same thing he did in Gujarat... eliminate all threats(Vaghela and Keshubhai Patel) and prevent any possible successors from rising up the party ranks(Anandiben is ~10 years older than Modi.). In keeping with the strategy... Advani and all senior leaders(Shourie/Yashwant Sinha etc.) were neutralised on Day 1.  Now Modi only needs to sideline Jaitley and Swaraj to consolidate his hold on power at the centre. (Otherwise if BJP loses 2019, Modi will find himself sidelined permanently.)

Obviously the impact of this change from a multi-polar power centre to a unipolar one, is going to be felt all the way down the party hierarchy... because there will only be one way to the top, You need to stay in Modi's good books and also not show signs of being too ambitious. So where there were 2-3 possible strategies to choose from, there's only one winning strategy. And where initial setbacks were not fatal, now it is a fatal blow because the guy who you were competing with outranks you and will do everything in his power to ensure you'll never become an equal again.

The number of dissatisfied BJP members is only going to keep growing, while they come to terms with the new reality.

IMO it'll come to a peak just before 2019, when most of their fates will be sealed based on who gets tickets.

368,"&gt;If you think corruption can only be solved by expats and not by native

Never said/meant that.

&gt; showed the example of how the NRI's had a huge impact on the growth of the IT sector. 

What the expats have done is something good, but for a country like India, which started relatively late, had a closed economy till the 90s, there is much work to be done.

Good amount of NRI whom i have been in touch with, come to India only for glorified holidays. Many dont know about their own origins properly or the value system their extended families here have. I am not expecting them to have a thesis on that, but simple one line worth of knowledge is good enough. Ignorant is the word.

Now, many believe that people do not owe anything to their country once they move out. I dont agree with that. Neither do i expect them to turn into some kinda revolutionaries, but atleast form a group to study and suggest measures which are severely lacking in India? They are in a position where they are exposed to better infrastructure and civic norms, and we Indians are gen an ignorant lot. Just another thread here laments how we do not have amber alert, when child trafficking is high here.

Modi wooed the NRI for their investments. A nice group of NRI maybe can ask him back, what he is doing on the issue of black money after promising so much before elections? Why do you want our investment when the people's money there is being eaten up by the ministers in subsidies and freebies and SCAMS? The service tax, the import duties have been tightened up, still we do not have basic structures in place like a simple dustbin or garbage/e waste collection in place? What is the state of whistle blowers in India?

JV etc are fine.. and Taking out people from poverty should ideally be like a by product of a country's growth. We do not have the basic things in place, and we all know how they select those babus for important positions.. Like TRAI members being from IAS batches. A comparative study between countries, its effects and tweaks can go a long way. Such groups can have members joining in and the objective will sustain itself.


These points are not a direct reply to your viewpoint. Just few things which i always thought i would want to contribute back had i been in some other place. We have everything here in terms of basic stuff.. unfortunately, we also have idiots sitting as politicians and babus who wd obviously think to corner as much money as possible cuz they know they cannot earn that based on their qualification/merit alone.",2015-07-01 07:24:16
369,"Moody's India Report Says Disappointment Is Creeping In Over Modi Government Reform Pace

---

&gt;* Bangladesh and India on June 6, 2015 sealed a historic land pact to swap territories, which will finally allow tens of thousands of people living in border enclaves to choose their nationality after decades of stateless limbo.

&gt;* NEW DELHI -- Flagging subdued rural economy as a 'credit negative' for India's sovereign rating, global giant Moody's today said there are growing concerns about risk of policy stagnation and ""some disappointment"" has emerged over the pace of reforms under the Modi government.

&gt;* However, the results of the latest polls conducted by it has showed ""some disappointment...with regard to the pace of reform under the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and increasing concerns about the risk of policy stagnation.

&gt;* ""A sustained soft patch for India's rural economy would weigh on private consumption and non-performing assets in the agricultural sector, (which is) a credit negative for the sovereign and banks,"" Moody's Vice President and Senior Research Analyst Rahul Ghosh said.

&gt;* The slower rural income growth is partly the result of increased fiscal restraint by the central government, which Moody's believes is unlikely to change in the coming quarters.

Activists very often forget that there are multiple, valid routes to the same objective. Its like some feminists who say, we will not engage with patriarchal men or women, even if they are capable of preventing violence against women in some occasions. Then there are those who do exactly that, because for them preventing that violence is more important than fixing patriarchy.

Kavita thought that using selfies as a way to promote 'beti bachao' is silly. It is silly, and useful. The same way laws, punishments, awareness, health are all useful towards that same objective. It is also part of Modi's self promotion, but people benefiting from self promotion while boosting a larger objective is nothing new.

The same way, Kavita being attacked for her views is also silly. Attacks on the internet pretty gender-specific abuses - and that is directly opposed to the spirit of 'beti bachao' etc. Unless it is protecting about BJP-voting *beti*s only.

PS. I saw one of the comments on the FirstPost article - Shruti Seth Aslam, her full name is, according to the commenter. He says ""Figures.""

&gt; * ""Industries across sectors are yet to reach the level of optimal capacity utilisation, indicating that the consumer demand continues to be weak,"" a person who attended one of the meetings said.

&gt; * The person said Modi listened to all their suggestions.The prime minister on Tuesday had separate interactions with delegations of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) delegations, each lasting about an hour.The meetings were attended by 15 CII representatives and 11 Ficci representatives, including Jyotsna Suri, Naina Lal Kidwai, Rajan Bharti Mittal and Pankaj Patel from Ficci and Sumit Majumdar, Vinayak Chatterjee, Pawan Goenka, Naushad Forbes, Sanjay Reddy and Baba Kalyani from CII.

&gt; * Both CII and Ficci praised government initiatives such as Ease of Doing Business, Make in India, Smart City Mission, Housing for All, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Clean Energy Mission, and Jan Dhan Yojana , the statement said.Sources said the meetings focused on key issues impacting industrial growth in the country, including the need for aggressive focus on the MSME sector that is an important driver for the success of the Make in India initiative.

Now Mr. Modi may be able to brush it off (he probably gets tons of those everyday) but for her to assume that nobody should attack her personally after she makes personal attacks is hypocrisy. 

Then to say an attack on her is somehow related to how people treat women in society is a more stupid argument. If she made her point without making any personal attacks, she wouldn't receive personal attacks in response.

That said, the punishment far exceeded the crime. Calling her

1. The number of staff; and

2. Their salaries?

17 staff strength doesn't seem too high to me. However, looking at the number in itself doesn't present the whole picture. What's the relative staff strength of Advisors in Central Govt and in other states? Remember, even people like Montek Singh Ahluwalia were ""appointments"".

Regarding their salaries, we're concerned with giving these people Rs. 1 L per month? Seriously? In which era are you guys living? You can earn more (in white) if you're a Grade C government employee with 15-20 year's experience.

&gt;* A sustained soft patch for Indias rural economy would weigh on private consumption and non-performing assets in the agricultural sector, a credit negative for the sovereign and banks, said Rahul Ghosh, Vice President and Senior Research Analyst at Moodys.

&gt;* The slower rural income growth is partly the result of increased fiscal restraint by the central government, which Moodys believes is unlikely to change in the coming quarters, said the statement issued by the rating agency.

&gt;* While the poll participants do not seem very enthused on governments policy decision-making, Moodys praised decisions taken by the government and blamed the lag in implementation on the multi-party, federal democratic structure in India.

1. Lalit Modi met Julian Assange and was heavily inspired by his approach to leaking everything!

2. Lalit Modi has cut a sweet deal for himself with MSM to keep on providing them this information

3. Lalit Modi is doing all this for NCP's Sharad Pawar - a) as a means to further reduce Gandhi stronghold on Congress, and b) get a better deal with BJP in the future.

Ruling out 1, since Lalit Modi is beyond such idealistic influences.

Ruling out 2, since Lalit Modi does not need the small change which MSM can pay him

So, that leaves out Option 3.

I believe in the hindutva philosophy that every indian is a hindu. Those who want to forget their ancestors are laughed at every where. People in the US look for their ancestors on ancestry.com I wonder what would all indians realize if they had a similar interest....guaranteed, 99.99% will find their ancestors to be hindus. I believe in BJP idea that all indians are one and the commonality comes from ancestry. The day modi hints saying, 'this is not the case, most of the indians inherited their current culture from elsewhere', I will not support modi. Of course, you must be proud of your kulcha. These ancestors went through tumultuous times. Would we not be dishonoring them by not acknowledging this ancestry?

Yes. The government is waging a war against whistleblowers.

http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-proposes-massive-dilution-of-whistleblower-law-115051100940_1.html

http://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/cat-quashes-pm-led-panel-s-orders-against-whistleblower-sanjiv-chaturvedi-115052800537_1.html

http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Amendments-to-Whistleblowers-Law-Passed-by-LS/2015/05/14/article2813016.ece

Whistleblowers are essential to the functioning of a democracy, and if we are to get rid of scams and corruption, they are necessary. One man, or even a hundred men, no matter how well intentioned or competent would be able to do that. BJP and Modi were voted in because the country was sick and tired of the scams that were the hallmark of the UPA. 

To have a transparent and competent government, we need to empower and embolden potential whistleblowers and grant them every protection possible. We have to set a precedent and reassure them that they will not be persecuted. We need to make sure that they are given enough protection, and are not harassed(or killed) as they often are. Look at the cases of D.K. Ravi, Lalit Mehta, Rinku Singh Rahi and countless more.

However, the current government does not have that view. It passed(!) a massive dilution of the whistleblower protection act in the LS, with barely any coverage from the media. Under the new law, **whistleblowers are only allowed to leak information that comes under RTI**, and will be imprisoned otherwise. 

Also, a **public servant cannot make any “public interest disclosure” if it could affect the sovereignty and integrity of India; the security of the state and its strategic, scientific or economic interests; friendly relations with foreign states; or lead to incitement of an offence. Public servants cannot also disclose information relating to commercial/trade secrets or intellectual property that can harm the competitive position of a third party and information received in confidence from a foreign government will not come within the purview of the whistleblower law.**

Who decides what affects the sovereignty and dignity(!) of India? Well, the government of course.

Issues of dangering ""national security"" due to malice on part of the whistleblower simply don't make any sense. If they release something on the public domain, they would do it only if they think the country needs to know about it. If they were trying to get information for some malicious organization, they would not have released the information and just handed it over to said organization secretly.

If they do release some sensitive information by accident, it should be upto the courts to decide their punishment, keeping in mind the importance of of all the information that they did release. And while the proceedings are under way, they should be given the highest level of security that can be provided by law.
