1,"There is a lot of govt propaganda &amp; planted news about Modiji. And a carefully cultivated image. And its easy to fall victim to it. If you have specific objective instances where he improved India's image, do tell.

Visiting foreign countries &amp; giving rousing speeches in front of already fawning captive audience of NRIs does not mean, all these foreign countires have increased their respect for Modiji/India. Modiji is doing the same as previous PMs, going around with a begging bowl, instead this is now called 'Make in India', invest in India etc. Modiji has given zero press conferences till now, after calling MMS mute &amp; what not, who managed to give 4 during his time. Ask him real questions, he will have a melt down &amp; run away from the interview..

&gt; Whom are you fan of ? RG, NaMo, AK 

This is typical of us indians, wanting to pigeon hole all critics into one camps, congress, bjp or aap. Why should anyone belong to one camp, just judge &amp; support a person/party on current/specific issue and stop giving blind support to any single party.

&gt;I was really hopeful about Kejri when he entered politics but he ended up being a delusional egomaniac resorting to cheap politics.

You are actually a nationalist in disguise. Of all politicians in India, kejriwal has demonstrated actual change although he happens to be a loudmouth (which he isn’t since the last couple of months). Compared to the great Namo, kejri has yet to display a single egomaniacal move either in public or private. He happens to run a party that’s filled to the brim with people who just want power at any cost, and so far he’s done an excellent job of kicking them out and ensuring that Delhi runs smoothly. And so far he has, despite an actual psychopath hot at his heels to stop him at any cost.

17,"I can agree on that, Modi is not a perfect PM and his demonetization could have been a good idea but implementation was the worst. He has not fulfilled lots of his promises and play dirty politics with religions for votes(who isn't) &amp; give them middle finger after but the our Indian politics has became a part of Social Media in his reign which is total next level thing as Indian politician because it connects politics with youth (the so called next generation). 

but yes we can say that, Modi is a bad prime minister but we had Rahul Gandhi on opposite side. Congress, the pinnacle of corruption and chapters of scams.

Modi war against black money might not be successful story, but he took some extreme steps against it.

&gt;All I can picture is the same NaMo projecting his arms to crowds soaking in a daily ego boost of what is increasingly almost a cult like following.

18,"Eh? What is this?

1) Yes, you are right.

2) Its intentionally done by team NAMO.

This wins elections. They do what they can to win elections.

After elections are won, the Public perception job is Namo's, and the policy job is his team's.

Most of the people here, would glaze over if they had to read 3 paras of papers on policy or law.

Most human beings have no capacity for the level of complexity required to deal with any major nation. So the job always goes to specialists.

Once upon a time, with a more peaceful media, and a more educated populace, and a slower news cycle - people would have had the time to work on long form articles, read things and think about it at length.

Or just waste that time utterly as well - you don't get the good without the bad.

In such a mythic time, people would ostensibly be able to discuss and mature as political creatures. (and use that political maturity to fight even more. Who knows)

But we don't live in that time. 

You vote for the person, and pay attention to the team. 

Modi has the team he can afford from his ranks. This is the result.

It was written the day he came to power. The only mistake you can make is not updating your understanding of the world, and asking for things that can't be reached.

Modi WILL win 2019. He has the better team, and the better election sense.

The better policy team is most likely in the Congress side.

Good policy SUCKS - its slow, it comes across as if nothing is happening. 

People will not vote for good policy. Most of the voting population is young.

The majority of that is Hindu. A large chunk of that Hindu base has a huge psychic wound, and the closer they are to religion, the more tension they have with many laws and discoveries that work against religion.

19,"A lot of my friends keep posting articles that claim that NaMo is the best PM India has ever had.  And if I counter those articles with opposing ones, they call the articles fake. I am not anti-NaMo, but then how does being a blind Bhakt help?  I try to point out the irony of selectively choosing articles that conform with their point of view and filtering those that don't.  But it just does not resonate.  

I am a staunch supporter of the current government, but not a blind Bhakt.  If the govt makes a mistake they are accountable for it and I have the right to ask questions without being labeled a pseudo-secular anti-national.  But it just does not work, so I have ceased having political discussions altogether.  It's chickening out, but I have limited resources of time and energy.  ",2017-09-23 12:04:04
20,"Alright, let's analyze OP's claims of him not being brought up here, in India -- 

&gt;I can no longer stand to call Narendra Modi my leader. 

Okay.

&gt; Edit. Let me clarify I was not brought up in India. So I haven't been in tune with politics in India. Even though I don't live in India I still tune in, because my parents tune in and because I visit my relatives back in India from time to time. Was getting a lot of comments why I hadn't noticed it sooner. It's because I'm uneducated on Indian politics.

Okay.

OP says he wasn't brought up in India, but calls Modi 'his' leader. Nice going mate!

**Looks like we got another 'living-in-India-but-wannabe-NRI' type Indian right here! xD**

I'm not a NaMo sympathizer, but I think you should analyze yourself first, OP. Lying straight up about where you were 'brought up' so that it would boost up your fragile ego. *sigh*

In this specific case, yes. Railways is to blame as of the connection to Modi, blame NaMo also. However in case Railways had agreed, built a bridge would this entire problem be solved and avoided? Is the bridge a solution and there are more problems with the infrastructure? 

The encroachers, the pavement dwellers, the vote Bank would still remain. Taking up space and making the exits  narrow.
